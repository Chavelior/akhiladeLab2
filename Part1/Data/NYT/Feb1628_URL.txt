Sign up to get it by email.___Australians will go to the polls next month to elect a new government, and because elections take place as soon as 33 days after they’re officially called, the country’s politicians will have to move quickly to solidify votes.Whoever takes the helm will have to contend with a set of challenges that mirror those of other democracies around the world.Here’s a look at some of the key domestic and international issues that we’ll be watching and that Australia’s leaders will be confronting.Election MeddlingIn February, Australia became the latest Western nation whose institutions had most likely been tampered with after the government acknowledged that Parliament’s computer network had been hacked by a foreign government.No country has been named as being behind the cyberattack, but security experts say China, Russia, and possibly Iran and North Korea are among the suspects.Officials said the three major political parties were among those affected, but wouldn’t say to what extent, because they hadn’t seen anything like this breach before. Even as he said a “sophisticated state actor” was behind the attack, Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted there was “no evidence of any electoral interference.”Australian elections are quick, they are compulsory and the majority of voters will cast their ballots on paper. However, during the last federal election, some areas used electronic lists to check voters’ names off electoral rolls. It’s not yet known if those electronic lists will be used in light of the recent hack.ChinaThe Australia that will go to the polls in May is markedly different to the one that voted in 2016, particularly when it comes to China. Then, the Australian economy was on fire, Chinese investment had surged to a new high, and while the government blocked some Chinese bids for infrastructure projects, it was a record-setting year for deals with Chinese companies.For years, the Australian government had been able to successfully navigate its economic ties with its largest trading partner, China, and its strategic relationship with its greatest ally, the United States, without having to compromise on either.But a slew of events have redefined Canberra’s relationship with Beijing. In 2017, a prominent Australian senator, Sam Dastyari, resigned over accusations of lobbying for Beijing and taking money from Chinese-born political donors. The government passed a foreign interference law, requiring lobbyists for other countries to register and disclose their activities — one of many efforts to push the Chinese government’s soft-power campaign out of the shadows.And in August, Australia banned Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, from participating in the building of a fifth-generation telecommunications network.Politicians have been reluctant to explicitly discuss the China challenge up till now, but pressure will continue to build no matter who wins the election.The EnvironmentIt was ostensibly energy policy that led to Malcolm Turnbull becoming the third prime minister in 10 years to lose the job — a dispute about addressing climate change prompted the change.But the public is far less divided. A recent poll found that 59 percent of Australians are concerned about climate change and frustrated at the lack of initiative from Canberra to address it.Several independent candidates are running in key electorates — including the former head of a clean energy corporation who is campaigning for the seat won last time by Josh Frydenberg, the treasurer.Even so, the two main political parties have staked out vastly different positions on climate change. The Labor Party has said that there will be no new coal-powered plants if it wins, but the Coalition has not ruled them out. Labor also supports a 45 percent emissions target by 2030, while the Liberal Party said that it is committed to 26 percent by 2030. Labor has also promised rebates for households installing solar batteries and wants 50 percent of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030.Mr. Morrison says he will spend billions of dollars on a hydroelectricity project to help alleviate rising power bills and offset carbon emissions. He has criticized the opposition’s policies, arguing that higher emissions targets would “crash the economy.”ImmigrationAs President Trump calls for funding to build a wall on the Mexico border, Mr. Morrison continues to boast of his role in stopping boats full of asylum seekers heading to Australia, and now wants to limit the number of skilled migrants who come to the country legally each year.The move to reduce the current cap on immigration by nearly 30,000 people is seen as a step back by many. The country has relied on immigrant labor to fuel its economic boom as its population has grown to 25 million. The move also represents a reversal for Mr. Morrison, who pushed back against cutting the cap before he became prime minister.The Labor Party, on the other hand, wants to increase the annual refugee intake from 16,250 to 27,000 by 2025 and said it would stick to the current migration cap should it win.But the issue of immigration has created a heated debate in Australia, as voters and politicians ask: How much of the opposition to immigration comes from concerns over strained infrastructure in cities, and how much comes from racism, Islamophobia and fear?A senator recently made global headlines when he blamed Muslim immigration for the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.Mr. Morrison has had to deflect criticism of his party as anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim. When asked if the Coalition had a problem with Islamophobia, he said: “As leader, my job is to set the right tone. And the tone I have set, you can see from my experience. My example has been to work with the Muslim community very deeply.”So what’s the most important issue for you this election?

Thanks to all who wrote in or shared in our Facebook group. Here’s a few of your responses.“I am all for journalists using deception if it is the only way to expose something as serious as the activities of the gun lobby and One Nation. We heard them say to put nothing in a recordable form that can be investigated in any accepted way, including by law enforcement, so if they are being so deceptive, deceptive journalism is the only way to find the truth.” — Helen O’Dea“One assumes that the job of journalists is to uncover the truth. If you ask people (particularly One Nation people) questions, they will lie to you. This method worked a lot better as a means to expose what One Nation really stand for. I like it. Would I like it if some of my political allies were shown up as a bit grubby? Well not as much, but its still a legitimate technique.” — John Brookes“Your ethics guide is right. The last thing you want is to be accused of deception in pursuit of a story as that diminishes the validity of said story.“The issue of what, and who makes the determination, is in the public interest is equally as important. The case of the N.R.A. and One Nation is a clear-cut case of foreign intervention in our democratic process. That is a concern and definitely in the public interest.“But there are cases, no doubt, that are less clear, which begs the question: how does the NYT decide what is in the public interest?

That question has been the subject of a big debate in recent years.On one side are writers like Richard Reeves and my colleague David Brooks, who argue that the upper middle class is flourishing. On the other side are people like the economist Thomas Piketty and Senator Bernie Sanders, who say that the important divide is instead between the 1 percent and everyone else.I offer my answer to the question in my latest column. I think both sides have a point, but that it’s a mistake to divide the country into only two basic income groups. To make grand pronouncements about the American economy, you need to talk about three groups: the top 1 percent, the upper middle class and everyone else.The column is based around a chart that I created with my colleague Sahil Chinoy.

It’s Largely Up to the New Attorney GeneralAdvertisementSupported byWill the Mueller Report Be Made Public? It’s Largely Up to the New Attorney GeneralImageAttorney General William P. Barr must tell Congress why the special counsel’s work concluded, but isn’t legally obligated to provide full details of the report.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Katie BennerFeb. 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The Justice Department will soon receive a final accounting from Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, of his nearly two-year investigation into how Russia influenced the 2016 election, whether the Trump campaign participated in those efforts and whether President Trump obstructed justice.But there is no guarantee that the public will ever see that full report. The special counsel regulations say that Mr. Mueller must submit a confidential report outlining his prosecutorial decisions to the attorney general, William P. Barr, and that the attorney general must then send a summary of that work to Congress.The regulations leave Mr. Barr considerable flexibility as to how much detail he provides to Congress and the public, discretion that was built into the regulations in response to the independent counsel Ken Starr’s decision to give Congress a lengthy — and, critics said, salacious — report on his investigation into President Bill Clinton’s sexual relationship with a young White House intern.Once the special counsel’s office delivers its report and closes its doors, the work of the Justice Department and Congress to inform the public of Mr. Mueller’s findings begins. While Mr. Barr must tell lawmakers why the special counsel’s work concluded, he does not have a legal obligation to give them the full details of Mr. Mueller’s report.Although there have been high-profile exceptions, the Justice Department generally does not publish derogatory information about individuals not charged with crimes. As a result, it is not clear how much information, if any, Mr. Barr would choose to include about Mr. Trump and other key figures in the investigation if there are no charges against them.Congress, for its part, is unlikely to be satisfied with anything short of a full copy of Mr. Mueller’s work. Democrats have expressed concern that Mr. Barr harbors a pro-Trump bias, in part due to his expansive view of executive power and also because, before being nominated as attorney general, he wrote a 19-page memo arguing that Mr. Trump’s decision to fire James B. Comey as F.B.I. director was not an act of obstruction.Democratic lawmakers are now debating how best to get the information that they believe must be shared with Congress, and by extension the public.“Barr should release the report with minimal redactions,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement this month. “The subjects of the investigations get to the very root of our democracy, and to withhold it from the American people would be absolutely unacceptable.”Mr. Barr said during his confirmation hearings that he would be as transparent as possible within the scope of the special counsel rules.What does Mr. Barr do once he has the report?The Justice Department will comb Mr. Mueller’s report for classified information and for grand jury testimony that cannot be shared in whatever summary Mr. Barr provides to Congress.“Barr has to make sure that the investigators’ sources and methods are not going to be compromised and that grand jury information is protected,” said Neal Katyal, a former department official who wrote the special counsel rules.Justice Department lawyers will have to balance the value of disclosing information that bolsters the public’s faith in the department’s integrity with the risk of compromising national security or other sensitive information. Depending on the length of the report, the process could take days or more than a week.How much detail must Mr. Barr give to Congress?The special counsel regulations, created in 1999, say that Mr. Barr must provide a report to the senior Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The report must explain why Mr. Mueller’s work concluded and list any times the attorney general told the special counsel’s office it could not take a proposed action.The regulations are not specific about how much detail Mr. Barr must provide, stating that the attorney general could publicly release the report if he determines it is in the public interest.Mr. Barr has said he will hew closely to the rules, which give him the option of sharing only a bare-bones accounting of the Mueller report. Democrats in Congress have said they want to see the whole thing.“Regulations governing Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation do not prohibit Attorney General Barr from disclosing Mueller’s final report and investigative materials to Congress,” Ms. Feinstein said in a statement on Friday, “and I repeat my call for the attorney general to provide the report unedited once it has been provided to him.”How much detail will Mr. Barr provide about the president?Some of the key questions in the special counsel’s investigation concern whether Mr. Trump was working on behalf of Russia and whether he obstructed justice, serious allegations that could result in criminal charges.A longstanding Justice Department opinion says that a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted, guidance that makes it unlikely that Mr. Mueller will charge Mr. Trump. Because of the department’s practice of not making derogatory statements about people who are not charged with crimes, Mr. Barr would have cover, if he chose to use it, to omit any damning information that Mr. Mueller might transmit to him about Mr. Trump.Mr. Comey caused a public outcry in the summer of 2016 when he said after an investigation that “no reasonable prosecutor” would charge Hillary Clinton, but then publicly excoriated her use of a private email server.But Mr. Katyal said there was an important difference between Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation and the choice that Mr. Barr faces: Unlike Mrs. Clinton, he said, Mr. Trump controls the Justice Department, essentially leaving Congress to hold him accountable for misdeeds. Mr. Barr’s summary could act as the road map Congress needs to fulfill its oversight role and weigh the possibility of impeachment.The question of how or whether the department would handle a referral to Congress for impeachment remains unclear.If Mr. Mueller found that the president committed a grave offense and wants Congress and the world to know, he could seek an indictment of the president. If Mr. Barr then chose to stick with the department’s opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, he would have to inform Congress of that decision, because the special counsel rules require the attorney general to tell Congress of any time that he denied a proposed action by the special counsel and why.“The special counsel regulations grapple with how to police high-level executive branch wrongdoing,” Mr. Katyal said. “If a sitting president can’t be indicted, then Congress must decide whether it must act, and it would need more information from Mr. Barr to make that decision.”What can Congress do once it receives the summary?If lawmakers are not satisfied by the summary that Mr. Barr provides, they can begin the process of extracting more information from the Justice Department by requesting documents and subpoenaing information, including the Mueller report itself.Congress can also call witnesses, including Mr. Mueller, to testify in a public hearing or a private deposition. And lawmakers can use their bully pulpits to publicly pressure Mr. Barr for more information, tying the Justice Department up in hearings and subpoena fights that last for the rest of Mr. Trump’s time in office.Democratic leaders are already laying the groundwork to obtain as much information about the Mueller report as possible, saying that the department has established a precedent of giving Congress sensitive information.“In other closed and pending high-profile cases alleging wrongdoing by public officials, both the department and the F.B.I. have produced substantial amounts of investigative material, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information,” Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and other Democratic committee leaders said in a letter to Mr. Barr on Friday.

Here’s What to Expect.AdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe Mueller Report Is Coming. Here’s What to Expect. A concise report will probably act as a “road map” to investigation for the Democratic House — and to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. By Neal K. KatyalMr. Katyal was an acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama.Feb. 21, 2019ImageA report from Robert Mueller will most likely mark the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.CreditCreditSaul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe special counsel Robert Mueller will apparently soon turn in a report to the new attorney general, William Barr. Sure, there is still a lot of activity, including subpoenas, flying around, but that shouldn’t stop Mr. Mueller. The report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite.For months, the president’s lawyers have tried to discredit Mr. Mueller and this report, but their efforts may have backfired. A concise Mueller report might act as a “road map” to investigation for the Democratic House of Representatives — and it might also lead to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. A short Mueller report would mark the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.The report is unlikely to be lengthy by design: The special counsel regulations, which I had the privilege of drafting in 1999, envision a report that is concise, “a summary” of what he found. And Mr. Mueller’s mandate is limited: to look into criminal activity and counterintelligence matters surrounding Russia and the 2016 election, as well as any obstruction of justice relating to those investigations.The regulations require the attorney general to give Congress a report, too. The regulations speak of the need for public confidence in the administration of justice and even have a provision for public release of the attorney general’s report. In a world where Mr. Mueller was the only investigator, the pressure for a comprehensive report to the public would be overwhelming.This is where the “witch hunt” attacks on Mr. Mueller may have backfired. For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller’s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump’s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors. Had Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump’s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump’s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone).Sure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail. But it is also quite possible — and more likely — to think that the president’s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.The House of Representatives has already begun its investigation. To understand the dangers Mr. Trump may face in the aftermath of a limited Mueller report, consider the request Congress made in 1974 to the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski as it opened an impeachment inquiry. Mr. Jaworski is analogous to Mr. Mueller — indeed, his appointment was a model for the special counsel regulations. In March 1974, Peter Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote to Mr. Jaworski, requesting all information he had uncovered in his investigation. Mr. Rodino understood that Mr. Jaworski’s mandate was far more limited than the House’s, and his letter stated that “it would be unthinkable if this material were kept from the House of Representatives in the course of the discharge of its most awesome constitutional responsibility.”Of course, there is no open impeachment inquiry now. But that could quickly change if Mr. Mueller writes a report that is anything less than a full clearing of the president: Congress would be under a constitutional obligation to investigate the facts for itself. Congress cannot be satisfied that impeachable offenses were not committed when Mr. Mueller’s investigative mandate did not cover many impeachable offenses, and when his report does not provide detailed information and answers to the few offenses that are within his mandate. This is where Mr. Mueller’s “by the book” behavior may be initially unsatisfying to Mr. Trump’s critics but ultimately more threatening to the president in the long run.The overlapping investigations by different entities, housed in different branches of government, spanning geography and even different governments (such as the New York attorney general’s investigation into the Trump Foundation), make it difficult for anyone, even Attorney General Barr, to end the inquiries. This news may be disappointing, for various reasons, to the president’s critics and supporters alike. But the ultimate result is a good one. It means the truth is likely to come out — maybe not on the timetable anyone wants, but it will. So whenever Mr. Mueller turns in his report, do not assume that things are over. Like “The king is dead, long live the King,” the investigations here serve a purpose that transcends any one individual or law enforcement entity. This is the architecture of our Constitution, which is designed to ferret out high-level wrongdoing through a variety of channels for the American public to see.RelatedOpinion | Neal K.

Goldstein is one of Robert Mueller’s lead prosecutors in the obstruction of justice investigation of the president.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesBy Noah Weiland and Michael S. SchmidtFeb. 25, 2019WASHINGTON — The routine was always the same. President Trump’s lawyers would drive to heavily secured offices near the National Mall, surrender their cellphones, head into a windowless conference room and resume tense negotiations over whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would interview Mr. Trump.But Mr. Mueller was not always there. Instead, the lawyers tangled with a team of prosecutors, including a little known but formidable adversary: Andrew D. Goldstein, 44, a former Time magazine reporter who is now a lead prosecutor for Mr. Mueller in the investigation into whether the president obstructed justice.Mr. Mueller is often portrayed as the omnipotent fact-gatherer, but it is Mr. Goldstein who has a much more involved, day-to-day role in one of the central lines of investigation.Mr. Goldstein, the lone prosecutor in Mr. Mueller’s office who came directly from a corruption unit at the Justice Department, has conducted every major interview of the president’s advisers. He questioned Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump’s former White House counsel, and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, for dozens of hours. He signed Mr. Cohen’s plea agreement. He conducted grand jury questioning of associates of Roger J. Stone Jr., the former adviser to Mr. Trump who was indicted last month.And he was one of two prosecutors who relayed to the president’s lawyers dozens of questions about Mr. Trump’s behavior in office that Mr. Mueller wanted the president to answer under oath. The questions showed the Mueller team’s hand for the first time: extensive, detailed lines of inquiry that could imperil the presidency.“He knew the facts like I knew the facts,” John Dowd, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, said of Mr. Goldstein.Over the past two years, Mr. Trump has waged a regular assault on prosecutors and other law enforcement officials investigating him, particularly on Mr. Mueller’s team. But mounting a high-level criminal case on obstruction is rare and complex, and even more difficult when the subject is a sitting president.Now that Mr. Mueller is expected to deliver his report in the coming weeks, Mr. Goldstein’s past as a prosecutor offers a glimpse into how he might be helping the special counsel make a final determination.ImageOver the past two years, President Trump has waged a regular assault on prosecutors and other law enforcement officials investigating him, particularly those on Mr. Mueller’s team.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesInterviews with Mr. Goldstein’s colleagues and friends and an examination of his past work reveal someone profoundly at odds with the cowboylike image Mr. Trump has painted of Mr. Mueller’s team. He is one of the few in the group with a career outside the law — in addition to working for Time, Mr. Goldstein was a high school teacher — and is known for his nonconfrontational personality and cautious approach to prosecutions.Before Mr. Mueller hired him, Mr. Goldstein, the son of a former Republican United States attorney, led the corruption unit in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan as the office made a highly unusual call to announce that it had declined to charge Mayor Bill de Blasio with a variety of crimes. The decision revealed how restrained high-level prosecutors often are in major political investigations.“Investigating and prosecuting public corruption offenses can only go so far,” Mr. Goldstein said in a rare speech around the time he joined the special counsel’s team in 2017. “We can only police the outer bounds of misconduct: the really bad stuff, or at least the stuff that we can prove.”Investigating the PresidentFrom the beginning, the byzantine structure of the Mueller investigation split its dozen-plus prosecutors into silos and specialties: money laundering, hacking, national security and public corruption.Starting in the summer of 2017, when Mr. Trump’s closest White House advisers were summoned to Mr. Mueller’s offices, they typically met the same calm stare and gravelly voice of the man his former high school students still call Mr. Goldstein.With James L. Quarles III, a former prosecutor in the Watergate investigation, Mr. Goldstein has led the office’s investigation into whether the president’s dismissal of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey — and Mr. Trump’s repeated assaults on the Justice Department — should be considered obstruction of justice.He has tried to determine the president’s motives in Mr. Comey’s firing during dozens of hours questioning Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, and nearly seven hours with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, in April.As evidence built over two years, Mr. Goldstein functioned as a repository of conversations that Mr. Trump had with lawyers, advisers and top law enforcement officials from early 2017 on. Among Mr. Goldstein’s jewels, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyers: exhaustive notes taken by Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn’s former chief of staff, which detailed in real time Mr. Trump’s behavior in the West Wing.ImageJames L. Quarles III, a former Watergate prosecutor, along with Mr. Goldstein, leads the obstruction of justice portion of the special counsel’s investigation.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesDefense lawyers who worked with Mr. Mueller also say that Mr. Goldstein — a donor to President Barack Obama’s campaigns — is the temperamental opposite of prosecutors on the team like Andrew Weissmann, known for a more hostile disposition. When tensions flared during witness interviews, lawyers would take Mr. Goldstein aside to soothe disputes.That did not mean Mr. Goldstein’s work was seamless: While the president’s legal team was initially cooperative with Mr. Goldstein and his fellow investigators, delivering key witnesses and millions of documents, the mood changed when Mr. Trump brought on the longtime Washington lawyer Emmet T. Flood.Mr. Flood promptly imposed restrictions on the West Wing’s participation, including limits to questions for the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly.Mr. Goldstein acknowledged to associates that Mr. Flood made his life more difficult.‘He Was Very Much Measure 10 Times, Cut Once’Just before Mr. Mueller and some of his earliest hires brought Mr. Goldstein to Washington for job interviews, Mr. Goldstein and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan faced a political investigation with familiar parallels to Mr. Mueller’s inquiry.Mr. Goldstein was leading a team of prosecutors under Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, who were investigating whether Mr. de Blasio had committed a series of corruption crimes: bribery, pay-to-play and campaign fraud.Part of the investigation focused on the owner of a scented, rat-repelling trash bag company in Queens who had donated $100,000 to a political advocacy group run by allies of Mr. de Blasio. The owner met with Mr. de Blasio himself, then an aide who set up a meeting between the owner of the company and officials with the city’s parks department. Within a month, he had a $15,000 contract.ImageMr. Goldstein, then the chief of the corruption unit at the United States attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, and Preet Bharara, his boss at the time, in 2016.CreditDave Sanders for The New York TimesMr. Goldstein’s team churned out pages of analysis on evidence they had gathered on at least four different threads. He would take their work to Mr. Bharara in regular meetings, trying to determine if there was sufficient evidence.The office made a highly unusual decision to release a public statement explaining why Mr. de Blasio would not be charged, citing “the high burden of proof” and the “difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit.”“He was very much measure 10 times, cut once,” said Kan M. Nawaday, a prosecutor who worked with Mr. Goldstein in the corruption unit. “Nine times out of 10, you do a lot of investigation, and you realize the conduct is pretty terrible and foul. But since you’re here to do justice, it isn’t a crime, and you walk away.”Mr. Goldstein has also gone out of his way to attack defendants who repeatedly fail to tell the truth. “And why do people lie?” Mr. Goldstein said in a closing argument against Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly, who had covered up illegal payments from a friend seeking favors and was found guilty on all counts. “Why do people hide things? Why do people keep secrets? Because they have something to hide.”A Life of Anti-CorruptionMr. Goldstein was born during a campaign fraud trial that his father, Jonathan L. Goldstein, was overseeing as the United States attorney in New Jersey. The birth caused an unexpected recess in the trial as the elder Mr. Goldstein took his wife to the hospital. The event made national news.As a toddler, Mr. Goldstein accompanied his father, a Republican appointee, to work, until President Jimmy Carter and the attorney general at the time, Griffin B. Bell, pushed the elder Mr. Goldstein to resign, replacing him with a Democrat. Incensed, he talked with his young children at the dinner table about his dismissal, warning of the perils of a politicized Justice Department.The younger Mr. Goldstein went on to graduate from Princeton and teach government at his high school alma mater, the private Pingry School in Basking Ridge, N.J. He then turned to covering national education policy and medicine at Time magazine, where in 2000 he investigated the deaths of three toddlers in government-funded day care facilities in Tennessee.Mr. Goldstein filed the article, unsettled that he could not do more. He wanted a career that empowered him to prosecute. By 2005, he had graduated from Yale Law School, and by 2010, he was working for Mr. Bharara, who put him on some of the Southern District of New York’s biggest cases.Walking AwayLike Mr. Mueller, Mr. Goldstein wears starched white dress shirts to work and prizes secrecy. Mr. Goldstein told a friend, Tim Lear, that Mr. Mueller even complained to his prosecutors about being photographed near Donald Trump Jr. at an airport.The investigation has been tiring, too. Mr. Goldstein, who used to attend early-morning SoulCycle classes in Manhattan before big trials, got into an accident biking to Mr. Mueller’s offices last year, when he was searching for ways to exercise while working so late.Now that Mr. Mueller’s work could soon be public, Mr. Goldstein’s record, Mr. Bharara said, is a reminder of what the investigation’s limits might be.“You want to have people who have had experience not only bringing high-profile cases, but in walking away from them because it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “The fact that you have a person who’s comfortable saying there’s nothing here, even though there’s a lot of clamor for it, is exactly the kind of person you want.”Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Ben Protess and Benjamin Weiser from New York.

Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, vowed to wage a legal battle if the Justice Department did not release the special counsel’s report.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Emily CochraneFeb. 24, 2019WASHINGTON — Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that House Democrats were prepared to go to court to force the release of the final report from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and subpoena Mr. Mueller to testify if it was not made public.Mr. Mueller, who has spent nearly two years investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice, is expected to submit his report to the Justice Department in the coming weeks, but the department is not required to release it.“We will take it to court if necessary,” Mr. Schiff, Democrat of California, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “And in the end, I think the department understands they’re going to have to make this public.”Justice Department regulations dictate that Mr. Mueller must submit a confidential report outlining his investigation and decisions to the attorney general, William P. Barr, who will then submit a summary to Congress.While he is required to explain the conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Barr has discretion about what additional details he provides.Mr. Barr, in his confirmation hearings, promised to be as transparent as possible under the special counsel regulations, which allow for discretion after criticism that the independent counsel Ken Starr’s lengthy report to Congress about President Bill Clinton’s sexual relationship with a White House intern was salacious.But Mr. Barr’s expansive views of executive power, coupled with a memo he wrote arguing that Mr. Trump did not obstruct justice by firing James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, have raised concerns among Democrats about his impartiality and his willingness to provide information that could be unflattering to the president.Mr. Schiff’s suggestion that Mr. Mueller and his report could be subpoenaed is among several possibilities Democrats are considering as part of an effort to make the report public. But it is unclear how successful efforts to subpoena Mr. Mueller would be.“I don’t know that you can,” Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said when asked about the possibility of subpoenaing the report on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”He declined to say whether his committee would also ask Mr. Mueller to testify, saying only that “I think we’ll have to wait and see what’s in the report.”But Neal K. Katyal, who wrote the special counsel regulations in 1999, said Mr. Mueller’s testimony was “certainly possible” — and Mr. Barr is obligated to submit the report to Congress if the special counsel has found any indication of “potential wrongdoing” by the president.“The overall intent of the regulations, it’s said time and time again, is public confidence in the administration of justice,” Mr. Katyal, who was also acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And any sort of suppressed report about presidential wrongdoing will flunk that test.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Democrats Plan Fight to Release Mueller’s Report.

By Marcy WheelerMs. Wheeler writes about national security at the website Emptywheel.Feb. 28, 2019ImageMichael Cohen testifying before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesEven before Michael Cohen appeared before the House Oversight Committee to begin testifying Wednesday, he delivered explosive new information. Several days before WikiLeaks published Democratic National Committee emails on July 22, 2016, Roger Stone called Donald Trump and — on a speaker phone that permitted Mr. Cohen to hear — told the presidential candidate that “he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange,” who told him that “within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” According to Mr. Cohen, the president expressed happiness about the prospect “to the effect of ‘Wouldn’t that be great.’”The detail is remarkable not just because it undercuts the president’s claims that Mr. Stone never provided him such details. It’s also a testament to how much critical information the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has kept hidden even in the most provocative of his “speaking indictments.” Even after months of investigation and voluminous indictments and sentencing memos, he’s still hiding events that lie at the core of his investigative mandate — events that involve the president directly.With virtually every charging document in the Russia investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team has provided far more detail than necessary and, in the process, sketched out the framework of what the investigators found. The description of the lies of a former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, disclosed that the campaign first learned Russians were planning to dump emails from Mrs. Clinton in April 2016, before the Democrats figured out they had been hacked. Even as Russians were dangling those emails, another filing from Mr. Mueller shows, other Russians were pitching a ridiculously lucrative real estate deal that depended on the involvement of President Vladimir Putin. Indeed, that same filing revealed that Mr. Cohen took steps to travel to St. Petersburg, possibly to meet with Mr. Putin, around the same time that Donald Trump Jr. met with Russians asking for sanctions relief. Mr. Mueller’s description of Michael Flynn’s lies explained how Mr. Flynn persuaded the Russians to hold off on any response to President Barack Obama’s imposition of sanctions in retaliation for Russia’s election interference.Each of those documents nods to Mr. Trump’s involvement. The document charging Mr. Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser, describes how he announced he was trying to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. The Flynn document explains how his deputy, K.T. McFarland, closely orchestrated what Mr. Flynn would say in his calls with Russia’s ambassador at a time Ms. McFarland was reported to be at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Mr. Cohen’s charging document even describes the president himself as Individual-1, the kind of language often used to describe co-conspirators.But Mr. Stone’s heads-up to Mr. Trump — and his enthusiastic response — went unmentioned in the indictment filed in January.Certainly, the fact that Mr. Stone informed Mr. Trump of the forthcoming WikiLeaks email dump is consistent with an oblique line in his indictment. “By in or around June and July 2016,” the description of Stone’s lies explained, “Stone informed senior Trump Campaign officials that he had information indicating Organization 1 had documents whose release would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign.”But that line didn’t disclose the most important bits of Mr. Cohen’s revelation: that among the “senior Trump Campaign officials” with whom Mr. Stone had discussed WikiLeaks’ forthcoming dumps was the candidate himself.Nor does it disclose the timing of this particular disclosure, which Mr. Cohen in his testimony recalled happened on July 18 or 19. That’s significant not just because Mr. Stone predicted the timing of the release, just days away, as he would later predict details of the release of John Podesta’s emails. But it lines up eerily with a line in the indictment of 12 officers in a Russian intelligence organization, the G.R.U., who conducted the hack of the D.N.C. That document says that on July 18, WikiLeaks informed the G.R.U. online persona, Guccifer 2.0, that it had received a one-gigabyte archive “and would make a release of the stolen documents ‘this week.’”In other words, Mr. Cohen’s revelation suggests that Mr. Stone was learning of WikiLeaks’ plans in the same time frame as the G.R.U. itself learned them. None of that changes the substance of the lies that Mr. Mueller alleges Mr. Stone told, about communicating repeatedly with WikiLeaks through intermediaries to learn about and try to influence the release of stolen documents. But it is one indication that even Mr. Mueller’s often expansive charging documents are most interesting for their silences.Mr. Mueller’s public filings have laid out a broad framework showing that Russians dangled a real estate deal and dirt on Hillary Clinton while asking for a range of sanctions relief. If Mr. Mueller were to charge this quid pro quo as a conspiracy or describe it as one in a report, it wouldn’t matter whether Mr. Trump knew of all the events that furthered the conspiracy. Because of the way conspiracy law works, it’s enough to show that Mr. Trump willingly entered into the conspiracy and took overt acts to pursue its objectives. As Mr. Cohen’s testimony illustrates, Mr. Mueller has been hiding examples where Mr. Trump did applaud the conspiracy. “Wouldn’t that be great,” he reportedly said just before the fruits of Russia’s theft would start to do real damage to Democratic fortunes.If Mr. Mueller is hiding similar examples, it suggests that whatever he plans to release in a report may have some unanticipated bombshells.other views on the michael cohen testimonyOpinion | Peter Wehner: Republicans Sink Further Into Trump’s CesspoolFeb. 27, 2019Opinion | Caroline Fredrickson: How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Won the Cohen HearingFeb. 28, 2019Opinion | Neal K.

Kilimnik, far left, worked closely throughout his career with Paul Manafort, center, President Trump’s former campaign manager.CreditCreditAssociated PressBy Kenneth P. Vogel and Andrew E. KramerFeb. 23, 2019WASHINGTON — In the nearly two years that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has been investigating whether there was collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, few figures seem to have offered more tantalizing leads than Konstantin V. Kilimnik.A diminutive, multilingual political operative who was born in Ukraine while it was still part of the Soviet Union, Mr. Kilimnik has continued to attract intense interest from prosecutors for his interactions with his longtime boss and mentor, Paul Manafort, and his suspected ties to Russian intelligence, even as Mr. Mueller prepares to wrap up his investigation.The full story of what Mr. Mueller has found about cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election is not known. But Mr. Kilimnik pops up repeatedly as a possible connection, with ties to both sides that are as enigmatic as they are deep.And his dealings with Mr. Manafort, who in 2016 served as Donald J. Trump’s campaign chairman, encompass two of the most intriguing elements of the special counsel’s inquiry to surface publicly: the sharing of polling data with Mr. Kilimnik, and the work he and Mr. Manafort did on behalf of Kremlin-aligned Ukrainian interests that were pushing plans that could have eased economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies.Dozens of interviews, court filings and other documents show Mr. Kilimnik to be an operator who moved easily between Russian, Ukrainian and American patrons, playing one off the other while leaving a jumble of conflicting suspicions in his wake. The effort to disentangle the mysteries surrounding him seems likely to leave questions even after the conclusion of the special counsel’s work.To American diplomats in Washington and Kiev, he has been a well-known character for nearly a decade, developing a reputation as a broker of valuable information like the alliances of Ukraine’s oligarchs and the country’s handling of foreign investment and sensitive criminal cases.He traveled freely to the United States, and on a trip in May 2016 met senior State Department officials for drinks at the Off the Record bar in the basement of the Hay-Adams hotel across from the White House. Later that year, he visited with the new United States ambassador to Ukraine in Kiev.But in a federal court in Washington, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have repeatedly portrayed Mr. Kilimnik as something potentially more nefarious: “a former Russian intelligence officer” who “has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.”And around the same time that he was passing through Washington nearly three years ago — just as Mr. Trump was clinching the Republican presidential nomination — he first received polling data about the 2016 election from two top Trump campaign officials, Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, as Russia was beginning a social media operation intended to help Mr. Trump’s campaign.By early 2017, a senior F.B.I. official was lamenting that the bureau had botched an opportunity to question Mr. Kilimnik while he was in Washington for Mr. Trump’s inaugural.Prosecutors have also scrutinized the effort by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik to drum up political consulting business with Kremlin-aligned political figures in Ukraine and Russia who were pushing plans to end the simmering conflict between the countries.Those so-called peace plans could have resulted in the easing of sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States — a policy shift to which Mr. Trump had signaled an openness during the campaign and one that would have been a major foreign policy victory for the Kremlin.In many ways, Mr. Kilimnik is an unlikely figure for such a pivotal role in an investigation that has shaped Mr. Trump’s presidency.To some of those he encountered, he was an impish, 5-foot-tall cynic whose American associates nicknamed him “Carry-on” or “KK” and who was rejected for a job with an oil company in Moscow in late 2003 or early 2004 because he was seen as too meek.At the same time, he did little to defuse long-running suspicions that he was a Russian agent. And his involvement in discussions related to back-channel peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia attracted attention from President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, which saw him as a functionary for oligarchs working to sell out Ukraine to Moscow’s benefit, a former United States official said.Mr. Kilimnik, 49, who has Russian citizenship, now lives in Moscow. He is unlikely to ever face obstruction of justice charges that the special counsel brought against him and Mr. Manafort. And the once chatty operative — who was known for kibitzing with reporters, diplomats and political consultants over WhatsApp and in the bar of the Hyatt hotel in Kiev — has gone dark.“There was talk of him being related to Russian intelligence agencies going as far back as the 1990s,” said Michael R. Caputo, who traveled in the same circles as Mr. Kilimnik when both worked in the Moscow offices of American pro-democracy groups in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union.In Kiev, Mr. Kilimnik became a valued source for the political staff of the United States Embassy, because he did not try to sugarcoat the financial motivations of the oligarchs who funded the political parties for which he worked, said David A. Merkel, who handled Ukraine issues as a deputy assistant secretary of state for President George W. Bush.“The idea that he is some master spy seems hard to fathom,” said Mr. Merkel, who was Mr. Kilimnik’s boss at one of the pro-democracy groups. “I find it much more likely that these guys were pursuing business interests without regard to core patriotic beliefs.”A First Accusation of SpyingImageA statue of Vladimir Lenin, the former Soviet leader, in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, Mr. Kilimnik’s hometown.CreditVincent Mundy/BloombergMr. Kilimnik was born in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, when the country was part of the Soviet Union.Already fluent in Russian and Ukrainian, he studied Swedish and English at a Soviet military language academy considered a training ground for the country’s military intelligence service, known as the G.R.U. He joined the Russian Army as a translator, and said he later worked for a time in Sweden for a Russian arms exporting company.In the chaotic years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Mr. Kilimnik was left without steady income. He made do with money from freelance translating gigs, before landing a job in 1995 in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute, or I.R.I., which receives tens of millions of dollars annually from the United States government to promote democracy.At the institute, Mr. Kilimnik came to know a handful of brash young Americans who would eventually become key players in the Manafort milieu and the Russia investigations, including Mr. Caputo, Philip M. Griffin and Sam Patten.It was Mr. Griffin who initially served as Mr. Manafort’s right-hand man in Kiev. He first brought Mr. Kilimnik onto the team, only to watch Mr. Kilimnik encroach on his position and eventually formally replace him when Mr. Griffin left the team in 2011. Years later, Mr. Kilimnik went into business with Mr. Patten, advising a Russia-aligned Ukrainian party that had once been Mr. Manafort’s client. The arrangement brought Mr. Patten to the attention of the special counsel’s team, and he pleaded guilty last year to charges related to his lobbying with Mr. Kilimnik.Mr. Merkel, who led the institute’s Moscow office when Mr. Kilimnik came on board, said Mr. Kilimnik “took the job for the money. Not because he believed in the mission of I.R.I., or in advancing the principle of free-market democracy.”Mr. Merkel said he later arranged an interview for Mr. Kilimnik at TNK-BP, a joint Russian-British oil venture based in Moscow. “They didn’t think he was tough enough to handle the rough and tumble of Moscow at the time,” Mr. Merkel said. “He hadn’t become what he would later become.”While his I.R.I. colleagues said Mr. Kilimnik seemed to be no fan of the fallen Communist government or Russia’s post-Soviet leadership, he appeared to embrace the perception that he had ties to Russian intelligence.“He did nothing to disabuse that notion because it added to his back story and made him more attractive to visiting consultants and women,” said Mr. Caputo who worked at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems when Mr. Kilimnik was working for I.R.I.Two former I.R.I. colleagues have said the group fired Mr. Kilimnik in April 2005 after suspicions arose that he had leaked information about an institute conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, to Russia’s Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the K.G.B.An institute spokeswoman declined to address the allegation that he had ties to Russian intelligence, instead saying that Mr. Kilimnik was fired because the organization “came into possession of information that led us to believe that he was joining Paul Manafort’s team on the Ukraine program.”That was a “violation of our code of ethics” banning freelancing, the spokeswoman said, “and we haven’t had a relationship with him since then.”‘The Representative of Russia’ImageMr. Manafort in March leaving Federal District Court in Virginia with his wife, Kathleen, and his spokesman, Jason Maloni. Mr. Manafort relied heavily on Mr. Kilimnik while working in Ukraine.CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesMr. Kilimnik quickly made himself indispensable to Mr. Manafort, who spoke neither Ukrainian nor Russian. At the time, Mr. Manafort worked as a political and business consultant to the Ukrainian steel and coal oligarch Rinat L. Akhmetov, as well as the Russian aluminum oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska.Mr. Kilimnik traveled extensively with Mr. Manafort, accompanying him to all his meetings and eventually becoming known as “Manafort’s Manafort” in Kiev.“Paul took Konstantin under his wing, not just as a protégé but as his own surrogate son,” Mr. Caputo said.Mr. Gates, who joined Mr. Manafort’s Ukraine team the year after Mr. Kilimnik and has since pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mr. Mueller stemming from his work there, later told an associate he knew that Mr. Kilimnik was a former officer with the G.R.U., according to a court filing by Mr. Mueller’s team.In a February 2017 interview with The New York Times in Kiev, Mr. Kilimnik denied ever serving in a Russian intelligence agency. “What would I do if I were a real Russian spy?” he said. “I would not be here. I would be in Russia.”But for the politicians and oligarchs who were Mr. Manafort’s clients, Mr. Kilimnik’s suspected intelligence connections suggested a seal of approval from Moscow. That was an important selling point, especially when combined with Mr. Manafort’s connections. The perception in political circles in Kiev was that hiring Mr. Manafort’s team would open doors in Washington and Moscow.ImageMr. Manafort was credited with introducing American-style political polling to Ukraine and helping the country’s former prime minister Viktor F. Yanukovych, above, smooth his rough edges and become president.CreditPavel Golovkin/Associated PressMr. Akhmetov persuaded Mr. Manafort to try to resuscitate the political career of the former Ukrainian prime minister Viktor F. Yanukovych, a Russia-aligned figure who lost the 2004 presidential election amid allegations of vote-rigging.In Mr. Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, Mr. Kilimnik was “known as the representative of Russia,” said Taras V. Chernovyl, a former party member.With help from Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik, Mr. Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010.Tailored Suits and Embassy MeetingsMr. Manafort, who was not known for spreading the wealth among his subordinates, paid Mr. Kilimnik $530,000 for “professional services and administrative overhead for Kiev operations” from June 2013 to January 2014, according to Justice Department lobbying filings, which show that Mr. Manafort’s company was paid $17 million over a two-year stretch around that time.By then, Mr. Kilimnik was married with two children. His family lived in a modest house not far from Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, where he traveled most weekends. But he lived a parallel life in Kiev, where he embraced trappings of his boss’s jet-setting lifestyle, trading the khakis and sweaters he wore at I.R.I. for tailored suits, a chauffeur-driven German car and evenings at an estate with a pool.ImageA protester in 2013 in Independence Square, in Kiev.CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThings started going south for Mr. Yanukovych and, by extension, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik, in late 2013, as mass protests erupted over the government’s corruption and pivot toward Russia. Mr. Yanukovych stepped down and fled in February 2014, eventually arriving in Moscow.Russia began a military incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014. And Mr. Kilimnik leveraged his access to American diplomats for a new endeavor.He turned up in Donetsk as the city was slipping into war, presenting himself as having “the State Department’s ear, the American ear in general,” said Aleksei Kovzhun, a member of a group of pro-Ukrainian political advisers working there.Mr. Kilimnik joined their ranks, and in emails reviewed by The Times, he encouraged them to appease the Russian-speaking population, who, he wrote, merely wanted “stable work, good salaries and a turn to the better for their children.”The American Embassy was overly focused on the Russian military threat, he said. “The whole American Embassy is counting barricades,” he wrote, adding about the United States diplomats he was in contact with, “the idiots.”In hindsight, Mr. Kovzhun said, “I can see that he could easily be a Russian agent who just came to monitor the situation, and be in the center of pro-Ukrainian power in the region.” Dispute Collides With Trump CampaignImagePresident Trump speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesWith their primary benefactor in exile, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik sought business with Russia-aligned factions that arose from the ashes of Mr. Yanukovych’s party.A common goal for these factions was to pursue initiatives to settle the Ukraine conflict on terms seen by many in the country as favorable to Russia, and as an opening for an effort to persuade the United States and its allies to lift sanctions on Moscow.Among the Russia-aligned Ukrainians they advised was Oleksandr V. Klymenko, who was a minister in Mr. Yanukovych’s government. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik discussed plans to conduct polling in connection with a possible bid by Mr. Klymenko for president of Ukraine in 2019, even though he was living in exile in Moscow and under European Union sanctions, according to three people briefed on their activities.Another client was a party backed by Serhiy Lyovochkin, a television company owner who served as Mr. Yanukovych’s chief of staff. The party, known as Opposition Bloc, had fallen behind in paying Mr. Manafort’s invoices, according to Mr. Kilimnik and other people familiar with the situation, and the pair hoped to persuade Mr. Lyovochkin to turn the spigot back on.The situation was on Mr. Kilimnik’s agenda when he headed to the United States within a month of Mr. Manafort’s joining the Trump campaign, telling associates in Kiev that he also hoped to meet with Mr. Trump and to potentially work with his campaign in some capacity.A White House spokesman said Mr. Trump was introduced to thousands of people during the 2016 campaign. While it is possible he met with Mr. Kilimnik, “the president has no recollection of it,” the spokesman said.Around the time of Mr. Kilimnik’s trip to the United States in spring 2016, Mr. Manafort directed Mr. Gates to transfer some polling data to Mr. Kilimnik, including public polling and some developed by a private polling company working for the campaign, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement.Mr. Manafort asked Mr. Gates to tell Mr. Kilimnik to pass the data to Mr. Lyovochkin and Mr. Akhmetov, the person said. Representatives for both Mr. Lyovochkin and Mr. Akhmetov said they neither requested nor received the data, and would have had no use for it.Mr. Mueller’s team has focused on what appears to have been another discussion about polling data in New York on Aug. 2, 2016. A partly redacted court transcript suggests that Mr. Gates, who entered a plea agreement with the special counsel that requires his cooperation, may have told prosecutors that Mr. Manafort had walked Mr. Kilimnik through detailed polling data at a meeting that day in the cigar lounge of the Grand Havana Room in Manhattan.The meeting also included a conversation about one Ukrainian “peace plan,” according to court filings.Prosecutors contend that Mr. Manafort lied to them about the meeting and other interactions with Mr. Kilimnik. Those lies, a federal judge ruled, violated Mr. Manafort’s agreement to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for consideration of a reduced sentence related to his work in Ukraine.Mr. Manafort’s lies about his interactions with Mr. Kilimnik gave “rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie,” Judge Amy Berman Jackson said.Slipping Through F.B.I. GraspImageThe F.B.I. building in Washington. A senior official at the bureau lamented missing an opportunity to question Mr. Kilimnik while he was in Washington for Mr. Trump’s inauguration.CreditLexey Swall for The New York TimesJust before Mr. Manafort was forced to resign from the Trump campaign in mid-August 2016 amid scrutiny of his work in Ukraine, the F.B.I. opened an investigation into the campaign’s possible ties to Russia.It led to a guilty plea by Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, for lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador related to the sanctions.By the inauguration, investigators were focusing on Mr. Kilimnik and his connections to Mr. Manafort.Yet Mr. Kilimnik again traveled to the United States for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, meeting in the Washington area with Mr. Manafort, according to Mr. Mueller’s team.While the trip was not publicly revealed until nearly two years later, it was on the F.B.I.’s radar. Peter Strzok, the agent who oversaw the bureau’s investigation of Russian interference in the election until he was reassigned and later fired for sending text messages critical of Mr. Trump, expressed frustration when he learned that Mr. Kilimnik had come and gone without being interviewed by agents.“Everything is completely falling off the rails,” Mr. Strzok wrote in a text to a colleague on Jan. 23, 2017 — three days after the inauguration — referring to the missed opportunity.The month after the inauguration, Mr. Kilimnik and Mr. Manafort met again and discussed a poll being planned for Mr. Klymenko’s prospective presidential campaign, according to court filings and interviews.The poll was not conducted, according to people familiar with the arrangement, and Mr. Klymenko ultimately did not run.In previously unpublished messages to The Times around the time of that meeting, Mr. Kilimnik suggested that the escalating news coverage was making him a target in both Ukraine and Russia.“After another surge of attention, I am sure I will finally get on the radar screen of the Russian authorities,” he wrote.Mr. Manafort’s allies point out that Mr. Mueller’s team has not publicly presented any evidence that Mr. Kilimnik is a Russian agent. They argue that it is unlikely that he is an agent because he was able to travel freely to the United States and deal regularly with its officials. To buttress this case, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers requested and received records from the government showing that Mr. Kilimnik communicated with officials at the American Embassy in Kiev.“If he was a Russian intelligence asset, then the State Department officials who met with him over the years should be under investigation,” Mr. Caputo said.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.

It was a bid to shame his rivals within the leadership and an attempt to reassert his influence, analysts said.“The Foreign Ministry has been sidelined to such an extent when it comes to Syria and Iraq and all the regional security issues that it’s really embarrassing, and I think probably very frustrating for Zarif and for Iran’s professional diplomats,” said Roham Alvandi, a historian of Iran at the London School of Economics.But it is doubtful that Mr. Zarif will return to his job with any more influence than when he left it, analysts said.“A lot of this is the theatrics of Persian politics,” said Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St. Andrews. “It’s part of a form: He’s gotten upset, so they have to come back and smooth the ego.”Mr. Ansari said, “What it basically shows, in some ways, is that I think Iranian officials always have this sense that they’re more influential than they are.”Analysts said the tensions had long been building between Mr. Zarif, a representative of the so-called moderate wing of Iranian politics, and his hard-line rivals in other state organs, notably the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.The country’s leadership is under enormous pressure since Mr. Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear treaty and the United States reinstated a broad set of sanctions, hurting Iran’s economy.The hard-liners had warned at the time that the treaty was signed that the United States was not to be trusted. The validation of that prophecy has greatly strengthened their standing and hurt the moderates.Despite the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Mr. Rouhani’s administration has continued to adhere to the treaty, hoping for a victory by a Democrat in the 2020 United States presidential election that could undo the confrontational policies of Mr. Trump.Mr. Zarif also backs Iran’s state organs joining the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organization that combats money laundering and the funding of terrorism by imposing a measure of transparency. Hard-liners in a government rife with corruption want nothing to do with the task force.It was against that backdrop that Mr. Zarif was publicly snubbed on Monday when Mr. al-Assad paid a surprise visit to Tehran to meet with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Mr. Zarif was noticeably absent from the Iranian entourage. Instead, he met with a group of American antiwar activists.Analysts described the episode as the straw that broke the camel’s back after years of slights against Mr. Zarif.Hours later he announced his resignation in a post on Instagram, went home and turned off his phone.But by Wednesday, he was back at work and being pictured beside Mr. Rouhani. (Under Iranian laws, ministers cannot resign without the permission of the president.)The influential commander of the elite Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who plays a leading role in Iran’s Syrian policy, also issued a statement backing Mr. Zarif.He blamed a “lack of coordination at the presidential office for Mr. Zarif’s absence at the meeting with the Syrian president,” and nothing “deliberate.”While the resignation struck some experts as unusually confrontational, they were dubious that Mr. Zarif winning his job back signaled any sort of a victory over hard-line factions that have long controlled foreign policy on matters like Syria.And they said Mr. Zarif had further undercut the impact of his resignation by choosing to leave over a matter of political optics, rather than a substantive policy disagreement with other parts of the leadership.“The function of the Foreign Ministry is basically to implement the foreign policy that is decided elsewhere,” Mr. Ansari said. “It’s been like that for ages.”In the Trump era, the Foreign Ministry’s remit has grown even smaller.“Basically, their role has essentially been cut down to managing Iran’s relations with Europe,” Mr. Alvandi said. And even in Europe, Iran’s standing has been hurt by accusations that its intelligence service plotted a bombing in France.Still, if nothing else, the episode appeared to show that at a moment of enormous pressure on Iran’s leadership, there was no good replacement for Mr. Zarif, who has built up decades of contacts and credibility, especially in the West.“It would be very hard for anyone to play the role he plays so effectively,” Mr. Alvandi said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Days After Publicly Quitting, Iran’s Foreign Minister Is Back on the Job.

The use of food banks almost doubled between 2013 and 2017.CreditCreditLaura Boushnak for The New York TimesBy Benjamin MuellerFeb. 24, 2019LONDON — The New York Times has been reporting for the last year on how nearly a decade of government austerity has refashioned British society, slashing away at budgets for policing, housing and welfare. It has also drawn a backlash in some quarters and, as Ellen Barry writes in the latest article in the series, reshaped the politics of many young people.Prime Minister Theresa May said last fall that the era of austerity is over. That is a matter of debate. And Britain’s looming departure from the European Union — Brexit, as it is known — could depress growth for years to come, meaning that budget pressures may continue far into the future. Here is a look back at the roots of austerity and what we know about its effects.What is austerity?It’s a campaign of budget cutting that Britain’s Conservative-led government began in 2010 in the aftermath of the global financial panic of 2008, the most crippling economic downturn since the Great Depression.The National Health Service and education were ostensibly protected, but government spending was trimmed across the rest of society: Spending was cut for the police, road maintenance, libraries, courts, prisons and housing assistance for seniors. Local governments suffered a plunge in revenue.As Peter Goodman wrote last year, austerity has made British society “less like the rest of Western Europe, with its generous social safety nets and egalitarian ethos, and more like the United States, where millions lack health care and job loss can set off a precipitous plunge in fortunes.”Why did Britain adopt it?The austerity measures were imposed to eliminate budget deficits that ballooned to unsustainable levels in the aftermath of the financial crisis.But Conservative Party leaders also sold budget cuts as a virtue, ushering in what they called the Big Society. Diminish the role of a bloated government bureaucracy, they contended, and grass-roots organizations, charities and private companies would step to the fore, reviving communities and delivering public services more efficiently.“The truth is that the country was living beyond its means,” the then-chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, declared in outlining his budget to Parliament in 2010. “Today, we have paid the debts of a failed past, and laid the foundations for a more prosperous future.”How has it affected British society?A United Nations expert said late last year that efforts by the Conservative government to pare state spending were “entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world.”Since 2010, the Conservative government has announced more than 30 billion pounds, or nearly $40 billion, in cuts to welfare payments, housing subsidies and social services, and the British leadership is in “a state of denial” about the devastation its policies have wrought, the United Nations said.The British government disputed those findings, but there are many signs that social well-being declined under austerity. The use of food banks almost doubled between 2013 and 2017. Families that receive benefits are now thousands of dollars worse off every year.What about children?Before the budget squeeze, governments led by both the Conservative and Labour parties achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” fell by roughly 800,000, to 3.5 million, between 1998 and 2012.But the trend began to reverse in 2012, the year Parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of austerity: Since then, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty.” During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, has more than tripled.It is not just the jobless and their families who are suffering. Roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said.ImageThe police at the scene of a stabbing in Birmingham last year. Police staffing across England and Wales has fallen by about 20,000 officers.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesIs austerity connected to rising crime rates?Murders and robberies, while not near American crime rates, have surged to their highest levels in a decade in England and Wales. The reasons are not entirely clear. Many police leaders have blamed cutbacks to police forces, and it is true that police staffing across England and Wales has fallen by about 20,000 officers.But other analysts said rising crime may be a knock-on effect of austerity cuts to youth and social services, as well as rising social inequality and poverty.That has forced the police to shoulder responsibility for a number of social pathologies that used to be handled by agencies that have been shrunken or eliminated altogether under austerity — adding to the burden on already stretched police forces.Is a new benefits system causing food shortages?The Trussell Trust, a charity, did find that the use of food banks picked up much more in areas where the new system, called universal credit, was in place than in areas where it wasn’t.Announced in 2010, the universal credit system merged six separate benefits into a single payment, supposedly to simplify the claims process and to reduce benefits gradually as people earned more from work.But its introduction, by the government’s own admission, was mangled. The system forced people to wait five weeks for their first payment, a painfully long delay that threw many families into debt.The system was supposed to be fully operational two years ago, but the deadline has been extended to the end of 2023. The opposition Labour Party has called for the rollout to be stopped altogether.So is austerity really ending?“People need to know that the austerity is over and that their hard work has paid off,” Mrs. May said last October, though she offered few details about how quickly public service and welfare budgets would grow.To be charitable, she was probably assuming that Britain would leave the European Union in an orderly fashion that would largely protect the economy from harsh shocks. Now, that does not seem as certain.In almost any case, however, Brexit is likely to put a damper on economic growth, cutting tax revenues. That would seem to promise tighter budgets and additional problems for the poor, especially for young people, because living costs are likely to rise and aid money from Brussels for deprived areas will dry up.And the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said the government would have to spend at least $16 billion above current projections to truly end austerity. And even that level of outlay, the group’s director told the BBC, might hardly be noticed.“We’ve had 40 billion pounds of cuts to department spending and cuts of 30 percent and 40 percent to some budget items,” the equivalent of more than $50 billion, the director, Paul Johnson, said. Even if the chancellor were to stop cutting, he added, “it’s still not going to feel great in a lot of areas.”Related Coverage‘Austerity, That’s What I Know’: The Making of a Young U.K. SocialistFeb. 24, 2019ImageFewer Officers, More Calls: U.K. Police Are Stretched by AusterityFeb. 1, 2019ImageAs Austerity Helps Bankrupt an English County, Even Conservatives MutinyAug. 17, 2018ImageShow AllAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsTeenage ISIS Member Who Wants to Return to U.K. Gives Birth - The New York Times

As another woman cradled her newborn, Ms. Begum also defended her actions in Syria, saying she had only taken care of her husband and children and had never made propaganda for the Islamic State or encouraged others to travel to Syria.“I think a lot of people should have, like, sympathy toward me for everything I’ve been through,” she said. “I didn’t know what I was getting into when I left. And I just was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child, they let me come back. Because I can’t live in this camp forever. It’s not really possible.”She also said she had no regrets about joining the Islamic State and that she had been “attracted by the propaganda videos.”A lawyer for her family, Tasnime Akunjee, said in a statement that though Ms. Begum’s family had not spoken directly to her, “we understand that both she and the baby are in good health.”Ms. Begum’s comments set off a fierce debate in Britain about the country’s obligations to a woman who was lured as a 15-year-old student to marry into the Islamic State. She was one of three schoolgirls, including Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who left Britain to travel to Syria in February 2015.British officials had said soon after they traveled to Syria that the girls would be allowed to return home without facing charges because there was no evidence they had committed terrorism offenses. But they held to a harder line this past week, with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, saying that he would not hesitate to prevent the return of those who supported terrorist groups abroad.It is not clear how Ms. Begum may be trying to get home.Ben Wallace, Britain’s security minister, said this past week that British officials would not help rescue Ms. Begum because it was too dangerous to provide consular services in Syria. He warned that anyone who had traveled to support terrorism against the British government’s advice would, upon returning, be “questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing terrorist offenses.”Ms. Begum’s parents have said that they would raise their grandchild if their daughter was jailed upon her return.She has been living in Al Hawl refugee camp in northeastern Syria since leaving the village of Baghuz, the last speck of land under Islamic State control in Syria, as Kurdish-led forces allied with the United States closed in. Her Dutch husband, an Islamic State fighter whom she married soon after arriving in Raqqa, Syria, surrendered to Syrian fighters allied to the Kurdish-led forces.On Sunday, The Guardian published an interview with an American woman at the same refugee camp who was captured after fleeing the same territory. Hoda Muthana, 24, told the newspaper that she “deeply regrets” traveling to Syria to join the group and that she wants to return to Alabama with her 18-month-old son.Thousands of people have been streaming out of the Islamic State’s fast-shrinking territory in recent weeks. The group once ruled an area the size of Britain, but that is now all but gone.Before giving birth, Ms. Begum told The Times of London that she had lost two children — an 8-month-old son and a daughter who was nearly 2 — to illness and malnutrition in recent months, and that she feared for her then-unborn child.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: After Giving Birth in Syria, Teenage ISIS Member Asks to Return to Britain.

Mueller III, and will decide how much of it to make public.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Katie BennerFeb. 21, 2019WASHINGTON — The new attorney general, William P. Barr, is preparing for the special counsel to deliver a report in coming weeks on the results of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, two officials briefed on the Justice Department’s preparations said.President Trump’s legal team and other allies of the administration have incorrectly predicted an imminent end to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for well over a year. It remains unclear whether Mr. Mueller might take further public action, such as additional indictments, before submitting his report to Mr. Barr.Once the report is submitted, it is not certain how much of it will become public or when.The submission of a report by Mr. Mueller would effectively mean his office is closing down. The special counsel would no longer be conducting investigations in conjunction with the F.B.I., and Mr. Mueller would not be opening any new lines of inquiry.But active cases that have not yet been brought to a conclusion would likely continue. New prosecutors from outside the special counsel’s operation could pick up cases that remain in progress. And some cases that spun off from Mr. Mueller’s investigation — including those being conducted by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan involving Michael D. Cohen and Mr. Trump’s business — would continue unaffected.No matter what the special counsel concludes, the findings will be sure to send shock waves through Washington, with Mr. Trump’s presidency on the line and both Democrats and Republicans poised to spin the contents to their advantage. The White House is bracing for revelations that could politically damage Mr. Trump, or open him up to the possibility of impeachment by the Democrat-controlled House, even if he is not accused of criminal conduct.The transmittal of the report to Mr. Barr would also place the attorney general in the spotlight as he decides how much of the findings to share with lawmakers and the public.Mr. Mueller was appointed as the special counsel on May 17, 2017, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s decision eight days earlier to dismiss James B. Comey as F.B.I. director.Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election and “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.” He was also given the option of referring any other matters that he might come across in doing so to other federal prosecutors, who can further investigate and open new cases.Once Mr. Mueller’s report is in his hands, Mr. Barr will have to review it for any classified information that would have to be omitted from any summary that Mr. Barr might decide to release, a process that could take days or even weeks.Former Justice Department and F.B.I. officials said that Mr. Barr could also draw up an unclassified summary to be widely distributed to lawmakers — making leaks all but certain — as well as a classified version to be shared with a smaller group of Congressional leaders.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.The country has been riveted by Mr. Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation into Russian election interference and whether Trump campaign officials worked with the Russians trying to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump.ImageDuring his confirmation hearings, William P. Barr, the attorney general, said he believed it best to be transparent about the report.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe special counsel’s office has indicted dozens of people, including a half dozen former Trump campaign advisers who have been indicted or pleaded guilty to past financial crimes, lying to the F.B.I., obstructing the special counsel investigation and failure to properly disclose their work for foreign governments.The office has also indicted dozens of Russian intelligence officers for stealing and then weaponizing information from Hillary Clinton’s inner circle. And it has indicted Russian propagandists for the misinformation campaigns they spread on social media that sought to dampen support for Mrs. Clinton in her campaign against Mr. Trump.But Mr. Mueller has not filed explicit public allegations that Mr. Trump, his campaign officials or other members of his inner circle worked with Russian operatives to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.And the special counsel’s office has not divulged any information regarding one of the main strands of its investigation — whether Mr. Trump or his aides could be criminally charged with obstruction of justice.At his confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr resisted pressure from Democrats to make firm commitments about how transparent he will be in sharing Mr. Mueller’s report with Congress and the public.The regulations governing the special counsel say only that Mr. Mueller must submit to the attorney general a confidential report detailing his decisions to bring charges in the inquiry. It is then up to Mr. Barr to decide how much of that report should be shared with Congress.During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr said that he believed it best to be transparent about the report, consistent with the special counsel’s rules and the law.Before he was nominated, Mr. Barr wrote a 19-page memo last summer arguing that Mr. Mueller was on shaky legal ground if he tried to treat Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., as an act of obstruction — a memo that has Democrats in Congress worried that the attorney general comes to the investigation with biases that could move him to share very little of the report with lawmakers.Mr. Barr has also noted that the department does not generally publish derogatory information about individuals who have not been charged with crimes. Given that there is a longstanding Justice Department legal opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, Mr. Barr may have to weigh whether it is right to share any information from the report that may cast Mr. Trump in unflattering light.Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel to Vietnam next week for a summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. Should the department share any damaging information about the president during his diplomatic trip, it could undermine his meeting.The president recently called Mr. Barr “a tremendous man, a tremendous person, who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department.”Even after the Mueller report has been delivered and shared, federal prosecutors in New York, Washington and possibly elsewhere will continue to investigate Mr. Trump, his businesses and other leads uncovered by the special counsel’s office.Those investigations and the possibility of criminal charges against Mr. Trump or an entity or person close to him are likely to loom over the remainder of the president’s term.Michael S.

Mueller III, cited new evidence that they obtained less than two weeks ago from Rick Gates, the Trump campaign’s deputy chairman.They said their revised account should not change the recent ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Mr. Manafort had been untruthful about his interactions with the Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, because they had presented sufficient other evidence of Mr. Manafort’s lies.Nonetheless, the filing was a rare admission of a mistake by the special counsel’s office, which is winding up a nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and whether anyone tied to the Trump campaign conspired in the effort to influence the outcome of the vote.The filing could give new ammunition to Mr. Manafort’s defense team, which has argued that prosecutors overreached in accusing Mr. Manafort of lying because they were too eager to believe Mr. Gates. Lawyers for Mr. Manafort have repeatedly contended that Mr. Gates, who has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team for the past year, is not a credible witness. Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators and conspiracy and is assisting the special counsel in hopes of a lighter sentence.The subject in dispute was unclear from the filing, but one issue that prosecutors have said that Mr. Manafort lied about was whether he ordered Mr. Gates to give Trump campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik before the election. Court records suggest that prosecutors relied heavily on Mr. Gates for evidence of data transfers.Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty last September to two conspiracy counts and, like a number of former Trump aides, agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation. But after a lengthy closed hearing on Feb. 13, Judge Jackson agreed with prosecutors that Mr. Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to them about three matters, including his relationship with Mr. Kilimnik.That ruling could influence the severity of the punishment Mr. Manafort receives as a result of two prosecutions by the special counsel’s office. He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7 by Judge T.S. Ellis III of United States District Court in Northern Virginia for eight counts involving financial fraud. Judge Jackson will sentence him for the two conspiracy crimes six days later. The combined sentences could mean that Mr. Manafort, 69, spends the rest of his life in prison.Like other court filings discussing Mr. Manafort’s interactions with Mr. Kilimnik, the latest one, filed before Judge Jackson, was heavily redacted to protect active federal investigations. Even so, it makes clear that the prosecutors were trying to defend Mr. Gates’s credibility while at the same time correcting the record on which Judge Jackson relied in determining that Mr. Manafort had lied to them.According to a footnote, news media coverage of the broken plea agreement led Mr. Gates’s lawyer to contact the special counsel’s office. Prosecutors followed up by interviewing Mr. Gates again on Feb. 15 and obtained new evidence, they said. But they said the new information does not “undermine the court’s conclusion as to the subject matter area as a whole.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Legal Memo To Correct Part of File On Manafort.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled this week that he had deliberately deceived prosecutors.CreditCreditMandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Sharon LaFraniereFeb. 15, 2019WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors recommended Friday that Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, serve up to 25 years in prison and pay up to $25 million in fines for a fraud scheme that they said spanned more than a decade and showed that he believed “the law does not apply to him.”The prosecutors, who work for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, recommended a sentence that would most likely ensure that Mr. Manafort, 69, spends the rest of his life behind bars. They said that a tax and bank fraud scheme allowed Mr. Manafort to hide millions of dollars in “ill-gotten gains” from political consulting work in Ukraine and to defraud American banks in an attempt to “maintain his extravagant lifestyle.”The prosecutors filed their recommendation on Friday in one of two criminal cases against Mr. Manafort that are now grinding to a close.Mr. Manafort, who worked for Mr. Trump’s campaign during a critical five months when he became the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2016, is awaiting sentencing in Northern Virginia on eight felony charges related to the financial fraud scheme and on two conspiracy charges in a related case in United States District Court in Washington.Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the federal judge handling the Washington case, ruled this week that Mr. Manafort had deliberately deceived prosecutors after he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in September and agreed to cooperate with them in hopes of a lighter sentence. In a transcript of that hearing released Friday night, Judge Jackson said, “My concern isn’t with nonanswers or simply denials, but times he affirmatively advanced a detailed alternative story that was inconsistent with the facts.”She found that Mr. Manafort had deceived investigators about three issues, including his dealings with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a Russian associate who prosecutors say has ties to Russian intelligence. At one point, Judge Jackson said, Mr. Manafort’s actions seemed to constitute “an attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability,” adding, “it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.”Mr. Mueller’s team has been investigating whether Mr. Kilimnik played any role in Russia’s covert campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors had told the judge that Mr. Manafort had lied about the fact that he had shared Trump campaign polling data with Mr. Kilimnik months before the 2016 election — possibly because he believed Mr. Trump would be less likely to pardon him for his crimes if his release of campaign data became known.Defense lawyers had argued that the only real proof that Mr. Manafort ordered the data transfer came from Rick Gates, Mr. Trump’s former deputy campaign chairman, who is awaiting sentencing on charges of conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. The lawyers said that Mr. Gates was not a credible witness and that emails supposedly backing up his account were ambiguous, at best.At the earlier hearing, Judge Jackson had questioned why Mr. Kilimnik would have been interested in polling data. Richard Westling, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, maintained that some of the information, apparently the polling data, was “very detailed” and “not easily understandable.” The judge said, however, that that made Mr. Manafort’s apparent decision to share it “significant and unusual.”Prosecutors also said that Mr. Manafort had deceived them about his discussions with Mr. Kilimnik and a plan to resolve a conflict over Russia’s incursions into Ukraine that some foreign policy experts say would have served the Kremlin’s ends. Like the sharing of the polling data, they said, those talks went “to the heart” of the special counsel’s investigation, Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s top deputies, told Judge Jackson.Mr. Kilimnik was crucial to the special counsel’s investigation, regardless of whether he was on the Russian government’s payroll or even was “an active spy,” she said. “We have now been over Kilimnik, Kilimnik and Kilimnik,” the judge noted, saying that Mr. Manafort’s communications with him were “at the undisputed core” of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry.Mr. Manafort had told prosecutors that he discussed the plan only once with Mr. Kilimnik — on Aug. 2, 2016, at the Grand Havana Room in Manhattan. That meeting took place a few weeks before Mr. Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign because of a burgeoning scandal involving his work in Ukraine with Mr. Kilimnik.Mr. Weissmann stressed that the meeting with someone the F.B.I. had assessed had “a relationship with Russian intelligence” took place “at an unusual time for somebody who is the campaign chairman.” Judge Jackson noted that Mr. Manafort eventually acknowledged that after Mr. Trump was elected, he and Mr. Kilimnik discussed the so-called peace plan for Ukraine at least three more times — but only after prosecutors had confronted Mr. Manafort with evidence of other encounters.According to the transcript released Friday, Judge Jackson found that Mr. Manafort had not simply omitted or forgotten facts, but had created “an alternative narrative” that was untrue. In general, she said that Mr. Manafort forced the prosecutor to “pull teeth,” adding that concessions came in “dribs and drabs, only after it’s clear that the Office of Special Counsel already knew the answer.”The judge has also found that Mr. Manafort had lied about information related to another undisclosed Justice Department inquiry. She ruled that he had deceived prosecutors about the use of donations raised by a pro-Trump political action committee to cover $125,000 worth of his legal bills. While leading the Trump campaign, Mr. Manafort staffed the committee with two friends.Judge Jackson found that in answering questions about the $125,000 payment, Mr. Manafort appeared to “be making a concerted effort to avoid saying what really took place.”Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Prosecutors Recommend Up to 25 Years for Manafort.

But British news outlets reported that because Ms. Begum’s mother has a Bangladeshi passport, the Home Office decided that it could remove her British citizenship.A Home Office spokeswoman said of Mr. Javid in a statement: “In order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless. We do not comment on individual cases, but any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.”Ms. Begum gave birth to a boy in recent days as she made pleas from a Syrian refugee camp for help returning home to Britain. The move to revoke her citizenship was quickly criticized by leaders from the opposition Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, who said she should instead face any consequences within the British legal system.Stella Creasy, a Labour member of Parliament, said Mr. Javid was trying to burnish his antiterrorism credentials as he made a bid to become leader of the Conservative Party.“However horrific her defence of ISIS,” Ms. Creasy wrote on Twitter, “if the Home Secretary can start with stripping this woman and her week-old child of their citizenship for his leadership bid….where does it end?”In 2015, Ms. Begum, who is from the Bethnal Green area of East London and was then 15, made headlines when she traveled to Syria with two classmates at the height of the Islamic State’s power in the region. The three young women flew to Turkey from Gatwick Airport and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border. They soon became the poster girls for young Westerners looking to join the group.Ms. Begum was recently found by a British reporter in a refugee camp in Syria after fleeing the last remaining Islamic State stronghold in the country. Last week, she told the reporter she wanted to return home to Britain. Days later, she gave birth to the baby boy.This week, Mr. Javid wrote an op-ed article for The Sunday Times in which he vowed to stop those who had joined the Islamic State from returning to Britain, saying the Home Office could bar non-British citizens from entry to the country, or strip “dangerous individuals” of their British citizenship. He said the office had used those so-called deprivation powers more than 100 times.“As home secretary, my priority is to ensure the safety and security of this country — and I will not let anything jeopardize that,” he wrote. “These are not judgments to be taken based purely on emotion and empathy. We look at the facts of each case, the law and the threat to national security.”Ms. Begum has said she does not regret going to Syria. She told The Times of London that seeing a severed head there did not faze her because “it was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam.” But she also said that she had done little more in Syria than take care of her husband and children, and that she had never made propaganda for the Islamic State or recruited others.Megan Specia contributed reporting from New York.

Kamenar, a lawyer representing Andrew Miller, spoke outside of the federal courthouse in Washington after a hearing for Mr. Miller last year.CreditCreditZach Gibson for The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageFeb. 26, 2019WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and ruled that a former aide to Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime Trump adviser who was indicted last month, must testify before a grand jury.In a unanimous ruling, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected a challenge to Mr. Mueller’s authority brought by Mr. Stone’s aide, Andrew Miller, who has been resisting a subpoena since last summer. After a Federal District Court judge held him in contempt of court, he appealed.But in a 16-page opinion, Judge Judith W. Rogers upheld Mr. Mueller’s authority, holding that “Miller’s challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails. Accordingly, we affirm the order finding Miller in civil contempt.”Judge Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, was joined by Judges Karen Henderson and Sri Srinivasan, who were appointees of Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, respectively.Paul D. Kamenar, a lawyer for Mr. Miller, said they would probably appeal, although they had not yet decided whether to ask the full appeals court to review the panel’s decision or whether to take the matter directly to the Supreme Court.“We are disappointed with the decision and will be considering future legal action whether before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court,” he said in a phone interview.Essentially, Mr. Miller’s legal team had argued that Mr. Mueller wielded too much power to qualify as an “inferior officer” under the Constitution, the type who can be appointed without Senate confirmation. Mr. Mueller was appointed in that manner when the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, named him as special counsel in May 2017. If Mr. Mueller was improperly appointed, they said, the subpoena was invalid.But at a hearing over the dispute before the appeals court panel in November, Michael R. Dreeben, one of the lawyers working for Mr. Mueller, argued that Mr. Mueller was not “off in a free-floating environment,” but rather was subject to the supervision and control of the attorney general. As a result, he maintained, there was no need for Mr. Mueller to have been confirmed by the Senate. The appeals court agreed.Mr. Miller’s attempt to challenge Mr. Mueller’s authority was similar to an earlier challenge brought by Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, who was prosecuted by Mr. Mueller’s office. Mr. Manafort’s gambit also failed, and he was convicted after a trial on bank and tax fraud charges in the Eastern District of Virginia and then pleaded guilty to separate conspiracy charges in the District of Columbia.The appeals court ruling in Mr. Miller’s subpoena case comes amid the latest round of rumors that Mr. Mueller may be close to delivering some kind of report to the new attorney general, William P. Barr, which could indicate that the special counsel’s work is winding down and that he is preparing to hand off remaining matters to regular Justice Department prosecutors.It also comes after the indictment of Mr. Stone last month on charges of lying to investigators, obstruction and witness tampering — raising the question of whether prosecutors still need Mr. Miller’s testimony, either for any effort to bring additional charges against Mr. Stone in a superseding indictment or for his eventual trial.The appeals court held oral arguments over Mr. Miller’s appeal in November — shortly after Mr. Trump ousted then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installed a loyalist, Matthew G. Whitaker, as the acting attorney general, temporarily putting Mr. Whitaker in charge of Mr. Mueller. In the interim, Mr. Whitaker has since been replaced with the confirmation of Mr. Barr.Mr. Kamenar noted the length of the delay between arguments and the ruling in Mr. Miller’s case, contrasting it with a separate dispute over another subpoena issued by Mr. Mueller’s office to an unidentified foreign corporation that is owned by a foreign government. In that other dispute, an appeals court panel rejected the challenge far more swiftly.“The fact that the court took over three and a half months to decide this appeal after oral argument, compared to the three days it took the court in December to decide another challenge to a Mueller subpoena that was issued to an unnamed foreign corporation, demonstrates that it is a serious and substantial challenge,” he said.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.By retaking control of the House in November, Democrats gained the power to demand President Trump’s tax returns. So far, they have refused to use that power. That refusal has become the subject of criticism from legal experts and progressive activists.Why are Democrats holding back? There is one explanation that makes some sense: They believe that Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Trump, will issue a report very soon, and they want to learn what’s in it before starting a fight over the tax returns. A Mueller report could include some of the same information in those tax returns.Yesterday, my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick called the office of Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who, as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has the authority to demand the tax returns. Ian asked why Congressman Neal had not yet done so.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]A member of his staff offered the same unpersuasive explanation that Neal has been giving for weeks — that he wants to “conduct this process in a judicious, methodical and deliberative manner.” But the statement ended with this intriguing non sequitur: “He also strongly believes that the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller must be allowed to be completed.” And Neal himself, in a recent interview with the daily newspaper in Springfield, Mass., said, “Clearly the other part of it is, you have to wait for the Mueller report.”If Mueller is actually within weeks (or days) of issuing his findings about Trump, I understand why Democrats may want to wait. But if the public release of his findings doesn’t happen very soon, it’s time for Democrats to demand the president’s tax returns. As a matter of national security, the country needs to see them.Here’s why …Every other modern president released his tax information voluntarily. Trump’s refusal to do so, after saying during the 2016 campaign that he would, suggests he may have something to hide. The biggest question is whether he has received payments from foreigners that may be clouding his judgment as president or giving them leverage over him.“Congress must know whether the president and executive branch are acting solely in the national interest — or are influenced by personal interest,” as Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, testified before Congress this month.Neal has consistently said he intends to pursue the tax returns. Since Democrats retook House control this month, though, he has turned cautious, claiming the request needs to be “part of a carefully prepared and documented legal case.”But as Judd Legum, the author of the excellent Popular Information newsletter, wrote this week: “As a legal matter, Neal is wrong. The law does not require a ‘documented legal case.’ It says the Treasury Secretary ‘shall’ hand the returns over to the Committee upon request.”The Trump administration would probably ignore that request or fight it in court. But the Democrats shouldn’t shy away from the fight. As Legum notes, the longer the Democrats wait, the greater the chance that Trump will be able to delay the release beyond the 2020 election.I’m all in favor of the Democrats acting cautiously and strategically when investigating Trump. Starting impeachment proceedings, for example, would be a mistake. But demanding his tax returns is different. It’s both important and politically popular: A recent poll found that 63 percent of voters thought Congress should obtain and release his return.Democrats should start the process within the next few weeks — with or without a report from Mueller.For more …Harry Litman, a former deputy assistant attorney general, writes in The Washington Post: “There were widespread expectations when the Democrats took control of the House that an early, if not the first, order of business would be to go after President Trump’s tax returns … Neal could request Trump’s returns tomorrow, and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin would have no apparent legal basis for refusal or delay.”Maura Quint, executive director of Tax March, a group lobbying for the release of the returns, told The Wall Street Journal: “It’s very important that the public have the opportunity to see exactly where Trump’s interests lie and have the public oversight as well as congressional oversight.”If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Mueller III, the special counsel, finishes his work.President Trump entering the House chamber to deliver his State of the Union speech this month. Mr. Trump has attacked the law enforcement apparatus of his own government like no other president in history.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesSupported byBy Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. SchmidtFeb. 19, 2019WASHINGTON — As federal prosecutors in Manhattan gathered evidence late last year about President Trump’s role in silencing women with hush payments during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called Matthew G. Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call.Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.Trying to install a perceived loyalist atop a widening inquiry is a familiar tactic for Mr. Trump, who has been struggling to beat back the investigations that have consumed his presidency. His efforts have exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finishes his work investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.Mr. Trump’s public war on the inquiry has gone on long enough that it is no longer shocking. Mr. Trump rages almost daily to his 58 million Twitter followers that Mr. Mueller is on a “witch hunt” and has adopted the language of Mafia bosses by calling those who cooperate with the special counsel “rats.” His lawyer talks openly about a strategy to smear and discredit the special counsel investigation. The president’s allies in Congress and the conservative news media warn of an insidious plot inside the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to subvert a democratically elected president.An examination by The New York Times reveals the extent of an even more sustained, more secretive assault by Mr. Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement. Interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump, as well as a review of confidential White House documents, reveal numerous unreported episodes in a two-year drama.ImageMatthew G. Whitaker, the former acting attorney general, is now under scrutiny by the House for possible perjury.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesWhite House lawyers wrote a confidential memo expressing concern about the president’s staff peddling misleading information in public about the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the Trump administration’s first national security adviser. Mr. Trump had private conversations with Republican lawmakers about a campaign to attack the Mueller investigation. And there was the episode when he asked his attorney general about putting Mr. Berman in charge of the Manhattan investigation.Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.On Tuesday, after The Times article published, Mr. Trump denied that he had asked Mr. Whitaker if Mr. Berman could be put in charge of the investigation. “No, I don’t know who gave you that, that’s more fake news,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s a lot of fake news out there. No, I didn’t.”A Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday that the White House had not asked Mr. Whitaker to interfere in the investigations. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said the spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec. “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.”The story of Mr. Trump’s attempts to defang the investigations has been voluminously covered in the news media, to such a degree that many Americans have lost track of how unusual his behavior is. But fusing the strands reveals an extraordinary story of a president who has attacked the law enforcement apparatus of his own government like no other president in history, and who has turned the effort into an obsession. Mr. Trump has done it with the same tactics he once used in his business empire: demanding fierce loyalty from employees, applying pressure tactics to keep people in line and protecting the brand — himself — at all costs.It is a public relations strategy as much as a legal strategy — a campaign to create a narrative of a president hounded by his “deep state” foes. The new Democratic majority in the House, and the prospect of a wave of investigations on Capitol Hill this year, will test whether the strategy shores up Mr. Trump’s political support or puts his presidency in greater peril. The president has spent much of his time venting publicly about there being “no collusion” with Russia before the 2016 election, which has diverted attention from a growing body of evidence that he has tried to impede the various investigations.Trump Has Publicly Attacked the Russia Investigation More Than 1,100 TimesPresident Trump has publicly criticized federal investigations, opening him up to possible obstruction of justice charges.Julie O’Sullivan, a criminal law professor at Georgetown University, said she believed there was ample public evidence that Mr. Trump had the “corrupt intent” to try to derail the Mueller investigation, the legal standard for an obstruction of justice case.But this is far from a routine criminal investigation, she said, and Mr. Mueller will have to make judgments about the effect on the country of making a criminal case against the president. Democrats in the House have said they will wait for Mr. Mueller to finish his work before making a decision about whether the president’s behavior warrants impeachment.In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are at least two other federal inquiries that touch the president and his advisers — the Manhattan investigation focused on the hush money payments made by Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, and an inquiry examining the flow of foreign money to the Trump inaugural committee.The president’s defenders counter that most of Mr. Trump’s actions under scrutiny fall under his authority as the head of the executive branch. They argue that the Constitution gives the president sweeping powers to hire and fire, to start and stop law enforcement proceedings, and to grant presidential pardons to friends and allies. A sitting American president cannot be indicted, according to current Justice Department policy.Mr. Trump’s lawyers add this novel response: The president has been public about his disdain for the Mueller investigation and other federal inquiries, so he is hardly engaged in a conspiracy. He fired one F.B.I. director and considered firing his replacement. He humiliated his first attorney general for being unable to “control” the Russia investigation and installed a replacement, Mr. Whitaker, who has told people he believed his job was to protect the president. But that, they say, is Donald Trump being Donald Trump.In other words, the president’s brazen public behavior might be his best defense.The first crisisImageMr. Trump tried to shape the narrative around the resignation of his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesThe investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign aided the effort presented the new White House with its first crisis after only 25 days. The president immediately tried to contain the damage.It was Feb. 14, 2017, and Mr. Trump and his advisers were in the Oval Office debating how to explain the resignation of Mr. Flynn, the national security adviser, the previous night. Mr. Flynn, who had been a top campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, was under investigation by the F.B.I. for his contacts with Russians and secret foreign lobbying efforts for Turkey.The Justice Department had already raised questions that Mr. Flynn might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading White House officials about the Russian contacts, and inside the White House there was a palpable fear that the Russia investigation could consume the early months of a new administration.As the group in the Oval Office talked, one of Mr. Trump’s advisers mentioned in passing what Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, then the speaker of the House, had told reporters — that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Flynn to resign.It was unclear where Mr. Ryan had gotten that information, but Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Ryan’s words. “That sounds better,” the president said, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump turned to the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, who was preparing to brief the news media.“Say that,” Mr. Trump ordered.But was that true? Mr. Spicer pressed.“Say that I asked for his resignation,” Mr. Trump repeated.The president appeared to have little concern about what he told the public about Mr. Flynn’s departure, and he quickly warmed to the new narrative. The episode was among the first of multiple ham-handed efforts by the president to carry out a dual strategy: publicly casting the Russia story as an overblown hoax and privately trying to contain the investigation’s reach.“This Russia thing is all over now because I fired Flynn,” Mr. Trump said over lunch that day, according to a new book by Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and a longtime Trump ally.Mr. Christie was taken aback. “This Russia thing is far from over,” Mr. Christie wrote that he told Mr. Trump, who responded: “What do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over.”Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who was also at the lunch, chimed in, according to Mr. Christie’s book: “That’s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.”As Mr. Trump was lunching with Mr. Christie, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office met with Mr. Spicer about what he should say from the White House podium about what was a sensitive national security investigation. But when Mr. Spicer’s briefing began, the lawyers started hearing numerous misstatements — some bigger than others — and ended up compiling them all in a memo.The lawyers’ main concern was that Mr. Spicer overstated how exhaustively the White House had investigated Mr. Flynn and that he said, wrongly, that administration lawyers had concluded there were no legal issues surrounding Mr. Flynn’s conduct.Mr. Spicer later told people he stuck to talking points that he was given by the counsel’s office, and that White House lawyers expressed concern only about how he had described the thoroughness of the internal inquiry into Mr. Flynn. The memo written by the lawyers said that Mr. Spicer was presented with a longer list of his misstatements. The White House never publicly corrected the record.ImageSean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, overstated how thoroughly the White House had investigated Mr. Flynn.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesLater that day, Mr. Trump confronted the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in the Oval Office. The president told him that Mr. Spicer had done a great job explaining how the White House had handled the firing. Then he asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.’s investigation into Mr. Flynn, and said that Mr. Flynn was a good guy.Mr. Comey responded, according to a memo he wrote at the time, that Mr. Flynn was indeed a good guy. But he said nothing about ending the F.B.I. investigation.By March, Mr. Trump was in a rage that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the Russia inquiry because investigators were looking into the campaign, of which Mr. Sessions had been a part. Mr. Trump was also growing increasingly frustrated with Mr. Comey, who refused to say publicly that the president was not under investigation.Mr. Trump finally fired Mr. Comey in May. But the president and the White House gave conflicting accounts of their reasoning for the dismissal, which served only to exacerbate the president’s legal exposure.A week after the firing, The Times disclosed that the president had asked Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation. The next day, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed Mr. Mueller, a Republican, as special counsel.Instead of ending the Russia investigation by firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump had drastically raised the stakes.Boiling frustrationImageJeff Sessions, the former attorney general, recused himself from the Russia investigation, a decision that greatly angered the president.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesMr. Mueller’s appointment fueled Mr. Trump’s anger and what became increasingly reckless behavior — setting off a string of actions over the summer of 2017 that could end up as building blocks in a case by Congress that the president engaged in a broad effort to thwart the investigation.On Twitter and in news media interviews, Mr. Trump tried to pressure investigators and undermine the credibility of potential witnesses in the Mueller investigation.He directed much of his venom at Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself in March from overseeing the Russia investigation because of contacts he had during the election with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.The president humiliated Mr. Sessions at every turn, and stunned Washington when he said during an interview with The Times that he never would have named Mr. Sessions attorney general if he had known Mr. Sessions would step aside from the investigation.Privately, Mr. Trump tried to remove Mr. Sessions — he said he wanted an attorney general who would protect him — but did not fire him, in part because White House aides dodged the president’s orders to demand his resignation. The president even called his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, over the Fourth of July weekend to ask him to pressure Mr. Sessions to resign. Mr. Lewandowski was noncommittal and never acted on the request.Trump’s Public Attacks Against the Russia InvestigationPresident Trump has publicly criticized dozens of people and groups related to federal inquiries into contacts between his campaign and Russia, according to a New York Times analysis of nearly every public statement or Twitter post that he has made while in office.

Source: Factba.se, a service of FactSquaredBy Karen Yourish and Larry BuchananOne of Mr. Trump’s lawyers also reached out that summer to the lawyers for two of his former aides — Paul Manafort and Mr. Flynn — to discuss possible pardons. The discussions raised questions about whether the president was willing to offer pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the Mueller investigation.The president even tried to fire Mr. Mueller himself, a move that could have brought an end to the investigation. Just weeks after Mr. Mueller’s appointment, the president insisted that he ought to be fired because of perceived conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump’s White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who would have been responsible for carrying out the order, refused and threatened to quit.The president eventually backed off.A new strategy: discrediting an investigationImageRepublican Representatives Lee Zeldin, left, Mark Meadows, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan launched an offensive against the Mueller investigation.CreditAlex Wong/Getty ImagesSitting in the Delta Sky Lounge during a layover at Atlanta’s airport in July 2017, Representative Matt Gaetz, a first-term Republican from the Florida Panhandle, decided it was time to attack. Mr. Gaetz, then 35, believed that the president’s allies in Congress needed a coordinated strategy to fight back against an investigation they viewed as deeply unfair and politically biased.He called Representative Jim Jordan, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and told him the party needed “to go play offense,” Mr. Gaetz recalled in an interview.The two men believed that Republican leaders, who publicly praised the appointment of Mr. Mueller, had been beaten into a defensive crouch by the unending chaos and were leaving Democrats unchecked to “pistol whip” the president with constant accusations about his campaign and Russia.So they began to investigate the investigators. Mr. Trump and his lawyers enthusiastically encouraged the strategy, which, according to some polls, convinced many Americans that the country’s law enforcement apparatus was determined to bring down the president.Within days of their conversation, Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan drafted a letter to Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein, the first call for the appointment of a second special counsel to essentially reinvestigate Hillary Clinton for her handling of her emails while secretary of state — the case had ended in the summer of 2016 — as well as the origins of the F.B.I.’s investigation of Mr. Flynn and other Trump associates.The letter itself, with the signatures of only 20 House Republicans, gained little traction at first. But an important shift was underway: At a time when Mr. Trump’s lawyers were urging him to cooperate with Mr. Mueller and to tone down his Twitter feed, the president’s fiercest allies in Congress and the conservative news media were busy trying to flip the script on the federal law enforcement agencies and officials who began the inquiry into Mr. Trump’s campaign.Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan began huddling with like-minded Republicans, sometimes including Representative Mark Meadows, a press-savvy North Carolinian close to Mr. Trump, and Representative Devin Nunes of California, the head of the House Intelligence Committee.Mr. Nunes, the product of a dairy farming family in California’s Central Valley, had already emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s strongest allies in Congress. He worked closely with Mr. Flynn during the Trump transition after the 2016 election, and he had a history of battling the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, which he sometimes accused of coloring their analysis for partisan reasons. In the spring of 2017, Mr. Nunes sought to bolster Mr. Trump’s false claim that President Barack Obama had ordered an illegal wiretap on Trump Tower in Manhattan.Using Congress’s oversight powers, the Republican lawmakers succeeded in doing what Mr. Trump could not realistically do on his own: force into the open some of the government’s most sensitive investigative files — including secret wiretaps and the existence of an F.B.I. informant — that were part of the Russia inquiry.House Republicans opened investigations into the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton email case and a debunked Obama-era uranium deal indirectly linked to Mrs. Clinton. The lawmakers got a big assist from the Justice Department, which gave them private texts recovered from two senior F.B.I. officials who had been on the Russia case. The officials — Peter Strzok and Lisa Page — repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump in their texts, which were featured in a loop on Fox News and became a centerpiece of an evolving and powerful conservative narrative about a cabal inside the F.B.I. and Justice Department to take down Mr. Trump.The president cheered on the lawmakers on Twitter, in interviews and in private, urging Mr. Gaetz on Air Force One in December 2017 and in subsequent phone calls to keep up the House Republicans’ oversight work. He was hoping for fair treatment from Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump told Mr. Gaetz in one of the calls just after the congressman appeared on Fox News, but that did not preclude him from encouraging his allies’ scrutiny of the investigation.Later, when Mr. Nunes produced a memo alleging that the F.B.I. had abused its authority in spying on a former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page, Mr. Trump called Mr. Nunes a “Great American Hero” in a tweet. (The F.B.I. said it had “grave concerns” about the memo’s accuracy.)ImageMr. Trump eventually shifted away from relatively quiet cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s investigators toward a targeted and relentless frontal attack on their credibility and impartiality.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe president became an active participant in the effort to attack American law enforcement. He repeatedly leaned on administration officials on behalf of the lawmakers — urging Mr. Rosenstein and other law enforcement leaders to flout procedure and share sensitive materials about the open case with Congress. As president, Mr. Trump has ultimate authority over information that passes through the government, but his interventions were unusual.By the spring of 2018, Mr. Nunes zeroed in on new targets. In one case, he threatened to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or even try to impeach him if the documents he wanted were not turned over, including the file used to open the Russia case. In another, he pressed the Justice Department for sensitive information about a trusted F.B.I. informant used in the Russia investigation, a Cambridge professor named Stefan Halper — even as intelligence officials said that the release of the information could damage relationships with important allies.The president chimed in, accusing the F.B.I., without evidence, of planting a spy in his campaign. “SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!” Mr. Trump wrote, turning the term into a popular hashtag.Most Senate Republicans tried to ignore the House tactics, and not all House Republicans who participated in the investigations agreed with the scorched-earth approach. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor who had led Republicans in the Benghazi investigation, felt that figures like Mr. Gaetz and, in some cases, Mr. Nunes, were hurting their own cause with a sloppy, overhyped campaign that damaged Congress’s credibility.Former Representative Thomas J. Rooney of Florida, a Republican who sat on the Intelligence Committee and retired last year, was similarly critical. “The efforts to tag Mueller as a witch hunt are a mistake,” he said in an interview. “The guy is an American hero. He is somebody who has always spouted the rule of law in what our country is about.”But Mr. Gaetz makes no apologies.“Do I think it’s right that our work in the Congress has aided in the president’s defense?” he asked, before answering his own question.“Yeah, I think it is right.”Ultimately, his strategy was successful in softening the ground for a shift in the president’s legal strategy — away from relatively quiet cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s investigators and toward a targeted and relentless frontal attack on their credibility and impartiality.The president opens a new frontImageMr. Trump hired Rudolph W. Giuliani as his personal lawyer last year.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesLast April, Mr. Trump hired Rudolph W. Giuliani, his longtime friend and a famously combative former mayor of New York, as his personal lawyer and ubiquitous television attack dog. A new war had begun.In jettisoning his previous legal team — which had counseled that Mr. Trump should cooperate with the investigation — the president decided to combine a legal strategy with a public relations campaign in an aggressive effort to undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department.Mr. Mueller was unlikely to indict Mr. Trump, the president’s advisers believed, so the real danger to his presidency was impeachment — a political act that Congress would probably carry out only with broad public support. If Mr. Mueller’s investigation could be discredited, then impeachment might be less likely.Months of caustic presidential tweets and fiery television interviews by Mr. Giuliani unfolded. The former mayor accused Mr. Mueller, without evidence, of bias and ignoring facts to carry out an anti-Trump agenda. He called one of Mr. Mueller’s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, a “complete scoundrel.”Behind the scenes, Mr. Giuliani was getting help from a curious source: Kevin Downing, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort, who had been Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, had agreed to cooperate with the special counsel after being convicted of financial crimes in an attempt to lessen a potentially lengthy prison sentence. Mr. Downing shared details about prosecutors’ lines of questioning, Mr. Giuliani admitted late last year.It was a highly unusual arrangement — the lawyer for a cooperating witness providing valuable information to the president’s lawyer at a time when his client remained in the sights of the special counsel’s prosecutors. The arrangement angered Mr. Mueller’s investigators, who questioned what Mr. Manafort was trying to gain from the arrangement.The attacks on the Mueller investigation appeared to have an effect. Last summer, polling showed a 14-point uptick in the percentage of Americans polled who disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the inquiry. “Mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,” Mr. Giuliani said during an interview in August.“So I think we’ve done really well,” Mr. Giuliani added. “And my client’s happy.”The F.B.I. raids Michael CohenImageMichael D. Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, told a judge that Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange the payments to two women who said they had sex with Mr. Trump.CreditAndres Kudacki for The New York TimesBut Mr. Giuliani and his client had a serious problem, which they were slow to comprehend.In April, the F.B.I. raided the Manhattan office and residences of Mr. Cohen — the president’s lawyer and fixer — walking off with business records, emails and other documents dating back years. At first, Mr. Trump was not concerned.The president told advisers that Mr. Rosenstein assured him at the time that the Cohen investigation had nothing to do with him. In the president’s recounting, Mr. Rosenstein told him that the inquiry in New York was about Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, that it did not involve the president and that it was not about Russia. Since then, Mr. Trump has asked his advisers if Mr. Rosenstein was deliberately misleading him to keep him calm.Mr. Giuliani initially portrayed Mr. Cohen as “honest,” and the president praised him publicly. But Mr. Cohen soon told prosecutors in New York how Mr. Trump had ordered him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump. In a separate bid for leniency, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors about Mr. Trump’s participation in negotiations during the height of the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.Mr. Trump was now battling twin investigations that seemed to be moving ever close to him. And Mr. Cohen, once the president’s fiercest defender, was becoming his chief tormentor.In a court appearance in August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and told a judge that Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange the payments to the women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Mr. Cohen’s descriptions of Mr. Trump’s actions made the president, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator and raised the prospect of the president being charged after he leaves office. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who in January became the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, said the implied offense was probably impeachable.The president struck back, launching a volley of tweets that savaged Mr. Cohen and his family — insinuating that Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law had engaged in unexamined criminal activity. He called Mr. Cohen a “rat.” The messages infuriated Democratic lawmakers, who claimed the president was trying to threaten and intimidate a witness before testimony Mr. Cohen planned before Congress.“He’s only been threatened by the truth,” the president responded.Another attorney general takes officeAs the prosecutors closed in, Mr. Trump felt a more urgent need to gain control of the investigation.He made the call to Mr. Whitaker to see if he could put Mr. Berman in charge of the New York investigation. The inquiry is run by Robert Khuzami, a career prosecutor who took over after Mr. Berman, whom Mr. Trump appointed, recused himself because of a routine conflict of interest.What exactly Mr. Whitaker did after the call is unclear, but there is no evidence that he took any direct steps to intervene in the Manhattan investigation. He did, however, tell some associates at the Justice Department that the prosecutors in New York required “adult supervision.”ImageWilliam P. Barr was sworn in as attorney general on Thursday.

Barr, whom Mr. Trump nominated for the job in part because of a memo Mr. Barr wrote last summer making a case that a sitting American president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice for acts well within his power — like firing an F.B.I. director.A president cannot be found to have broken the law, Mr. Barr argued, if he was exercising his executive powers to fire subordinates or use his “complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding.”The memo might have ingratiated Mr. Barr to his future boss, but Mr. Barr is also respected among the rank and file in the Justice Department. Many officials there hope he will try to change the Trump administration’s combative tone toward the department, as well as toward the F.B.I.Whether it is too late is another question. Mr. Trump’s language, and allegations of “deep state” excesses, are now embedded in the political conversation, used as a cudgel by the president’s supporters.This past December, days before Mr. Flynn was to be sentenced for lying to the F.B.I., his lawyers wrote a memo to the judge suggesting that federal agents had tricked the former national security adviser into lying. The judge roundly rejected that argument, and on sentencing day, he excoriated Mr. Flynn for his crimes.The argument about F.B.I. trickery did, however, appear to please the one man who holds great power over Mr. Flynn’s future — the constitutional power to pardon.“Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,” Mr. Trump tweeted cheerily on the morning of the sentencing.Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Site FeedbackIn ‘The Threat,’ Andrew McCabe Issues the Latest Warning Call About Trump’s America - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexBooksSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperBooks|In ‘The Threat,’ Andrew McCabe Issues the Latest Warning Call About Trump’s AmericaAdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIn ‘The Threat,’ Andrew McCabe Issues the Latest Warning Call About Trump’s AmericaBy Dwight GarnerFeb. 16, 2019ImageCreditCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York TimesBuy Book ▾AmazonLocal BooksellersBarnes and NobleWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On the back cover of his new book, “The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,” Andrew G. McCabe looks preposterously fit (he competes in triathlons). His hands are at his hips, gunslinger style. It’s as if he were a kind High Plains sheriff who had stumbled upon an intolerable rodeo of villainy.McCabe’s prose is lean, too. (Not that he wrote this book. In his acknowledgments, he thanks “a great writing and editing team.”) The first sentence demands to be read in the voice of Jack Webb from “Dragnet”: “Between the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law.”McCabe is, of course, the former deputy director of the F.B.I. who was fired last March, just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. He was briefly the F.B.I.’s acting director, after the dismissal of James B. Comey. The president hooted on Twitter: “Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the F.B.I. — A great day for Democracy.”This lawman, a registered Republican for the entirety of his adult life, may have been driven out of Dodge. But he has dusted off his white hat and returned with a memoir that’s better than any book typed this quickly has a right to be.“The Threat” is a concise yet substantive account of how the F.B.I. works, at a moment when its procedures and impartiality are under attack. It’s an unambiguous indictment of Trump’s moral behavior. “Let me state the proposition openly,” McCabe writes. “The work of the F.B.I. is being undermined by the current president.”It’s a rapid-fire G-man memoir, moving from the author’s training in Quantico (shades of “The Silence of the Lambs”) through his experiences chasing the Russian mob, the Boston Marathon bombers and others. The book is patriotic and oddly stirring. It has moments of opacity, where you feel he is holding back at crucial moments, but it is filled with disturbingly piquant details.McCabe made headlines after a recent “60 Minutes” interview, during which he reported that top Justice Department officials, disquieted by Trump’s firing of Comey, discussed trying to encourage cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. He also confirmed a New York Times report that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, offered to wear a wire during his meetings with Trump.These stories, frustratingly, were in the TV interview but are not in this book. But there are many other gleanings.McCabe’s accounts of his baffled interactions with Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, would be high comedy if they were not so dire. They are a highlight, or a lowlight, of this book. We see a Sessions who is openly racist. “Back in the old days,” he says to the author about the F.B.I., “you all only hired Irishmen. They were drunks, but they could be trusted.”Sessions seemed not to read his daily briefings. He had “trouble focusing” and “seemed to lack basic knowledge about the jurisdictions of various arms of federal law enforcement.”Sessions concentrated almost solely on the immigration aspect of any issue, McCabe writes, even when there was no immigration aspect. Similarly, “Sessions spent a lot of time yelling at us about the death penalty, despite the fact that the F.B.I. plays no role of any kind in whether to seek the death penalty.”The portrait of Sessions is of a man for whom merely ordering lunch seems to be above the timberline of his intellect and curiosity.A recent cartoon in The New Yorker depicted a person feverishly covering two walls with a link chart, with names and Scotch tape and Magic Marker, of the Trump administration’s alleged misdeeds. Another person stands watching from a doorway. The caption is: “Hon, Mueller’s got this. Come to bed.”ImageAndrew G. McCabeCreditRandall SlavinIt turns out that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has strong opinions about charts. McCabe worked under him at the bureau. “He detested diagonal lines,” McCabe writes. “Some colors he liked. Some he didn’t.” McCabe explains the reasons for these preferences.He writes about Mueller: “Sometimes he would take out the chart and suddenly you would see his face fall, as if to say the kind of thing that he would rarely say: Who made this piece of crap?”Mueller is, in this book, the Mueller we have come to know: punctual, determined, the antithesis of casual, with a special loathing for people who speak when they don’t know what they are talking about.“Ball-busting is his way of expressing affection,” McCabe writes. “If he said, Where does a person even find a tie like that? I knew things were fine: He never went out of his way to insult anyone he didn’t actually like.”McCabe’s memoir joins a roster of recent and alarming books by high-ranking members of the United States’ justice and intelligence communities, each pushing back sharply against the president’s war on facts and competence.These books include Comey’s “A Higher Loyalty” as well as “The Assault on Intelligence,” by Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the National Security Agency, and “Facts and Fears,” by James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, written with Trey Brown.Each is its own Paul Revere ride of warning. Each is a reminder that we will be reading about Trump and his administration for the rest of our lives, for the exact opposite reason that we will also be reading about Lincoln and his for the rest of our lives.There’s much more in McCabe’s book. He’s good on things like what it’s like to take a polygraph test, and the fastest way to take off a seatbelt.He wades back through the big muddy of the Benghazi hearings. He writes of his fears about the increasing use of encryption.He spends a good deal of time talking about Hillary Clinton and her email server. He argues that Comey, whom he admires, made crucial mistakes in how he handled the matter. “As a matter of policy, the F.B.I. does everything possible not to influence elections. In 2016, it seems we did.”He recounts the attacks on his credibility, by Trump and others, after his wife, Jill, ran for Virginia’s State Senate as a Democrat in 2015. He hurt his own credibility, according to the F.B.I. inspector general, by making false statements about his contacts with the media.The Trump-bashing texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, his F.B.I. subordinates, did something worse: They cast doubts about the impartiality of the agency. McCabe rushes past this material too swiftly. Yet if McCabe has made mistakes, his basic decency shines through in this memoir.He adds to our understanding of how deeply Trump remains under Vladimir Putin’s sway. After a North Korean ballistic missile test, Trump told an F.B.I. briefer that reports of the test were a hoax. McCabe writes, incredulously: “He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so.”About Trump, the author asks, “What more could a person do to erode the credibility of the presidency?” He watches this moral limbo dancer go lower and lower. Yet he sees the president as a symptom as much as a disease.“When is the right time,” he asks, “to give up on people’s general ability to understand any slightly complicated statement that they don’t agree with?”Follow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner.The ThreatHow the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and TrumpBy Andrew G.

Manafort arriving at court in Washington, D.C., in 2017.CreditCreditAndrew Harrer/BloombergBy William K. RashbaumFeb. 22, 2019[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The Manhattan district attorney’s office is preparing state criminal charges against Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, in an effort to ensure he will still face prison time even if the president pardons him for his federal crimes, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.Mr. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced next month for convictions in two federal cases brought by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III. He faces up to 25 years in prison for tax and bank fraud and additional time for conspiracy counts in a related case. It could effectively be a life sentence for Mr. Manafort, who turns 70 in April.The president has broad power to issue pardons for federal crimes, but no such authority in state cases. And while there has been no clear indication that Mr. Trump intends to pardon Mr. Manafort, the president has spoken repeatedly of his pardon power and defended his former campaign chairman on a number of occasions, calling him a “brave man.”The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., first began investigating Mr. Manafort in 2017 in connection with loans he received from two banks. Those loans were also the subject of some of the counts in the federal indictment that led to his conviction last year. But the state prosecutors deferred their inquiry in order not to interfere with Mr. Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.They resumed their investigation in recent months, and a state grand jury began hearing evidence in the case, several people with knowledge of the matter said. The panel is expected to wrap up its work in the coming weeks, several of the people said, and prosecutors likely will ask the grand jurors to vote on charges shortly thereafter.Mr. Vance’s office is expected to seek charges whether or not the president pardons Mr. Manafort. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg.Any charges brought by Mr. Vance’s office would likely be challenged on double jeopardy grounds. New York state law includes stronger protections than those provided by the United States Constitution, and Mr. Manafort’s defense team is likely to challenge any state charges. But prosecutors in Mr. Vance’s office have expressed confidence that they would prevail, people with knowledge of the matter said.Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort, said his legal team had no comment. Mr. Vance’s office also had no comment.Mr. Manafort, who worked for Mr. Trump’s campaign during a critical five months when he became the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2016, was convicted in federal court in Virginia in August on eight counts of various financial crimes. Prosecutors said Mr. Manafort used foreign accounts to hide millions of dollars from his political consulting work in Ukraine and evade taxes, and lied to banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans.Weeks later, he agreed to plead guilty in a related case in federal court in Washington, D.C., and cooperate with prosecutors from Mr. Mueller’s office. But the deal blew up when a judge ruled he had repeatedly lied to the government about his contact with a Russian associate during the campaign and after the election. Prosecutors claim that the associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, has ties to Russian intelligence, and have been investigating whether he was involved in a covert attempt to influence the election results.In the Manhattan case, the evidence presented to a grand jury appears to have been connected to loans issued by Citizens Bank in Rhode Island and Federal Savings Bank in Chicago.The banks have received grand jury subpoenas for records relating to the loans they issued to Mr. Manafort, which were worth millions of dollars, people with knowledge of the matter said. The grand jury has also been hearing testimony about the loans. Citizens Bank has been cooperating with the investigation, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A spokeswoman for Federal Savings Bank did not respond to a request for comment.It is unclear precisely what charges Mr. Manafort would face, but they could include two state felonies: falsifying business records, if the evidence shows Mr. Manafort used the loan money for an unauthorized purpose, and mortgage fraud.Correction: Feb. 22, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the number of counts Paul J. Manafort was convicted on. It was eight counts, not 10.Follow William Rashbaum on Twitter at @WRashbaum.Sharon LaFraniere and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

Mueller III, and unsealed on Saturday, painted a damning portrait of Mr. Manafort, 69, a political consultant who led Mr. Trump’s campaign during a critical five-month period in 2016.The memo involved one of two federal cases against Mr. Manafort. Prosecutors did not recommend a sentence, instead citing sentencing guidelines of up to 22 years for a wide-ranging conspiracy involving obstruction of justice, money laundering, hidden overseas bank accounts and false statements to the Justice Department. But the two charges Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to in the case carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.[Read the sentencing memo.] The memo came as Mr. Mueller is believed to be wrapping up his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, whether any associates of Mr. Trump were complicit in Moscow’s operation and whether the president obstructed justice in fighting the inquiry.The prosecutors and the defense will both have their final say about Mr. Manafort next month when he is sentenced for a total of 10 felonies stemming from the two separate prosecutions, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Northern Virginia. Given his age, Mr. Manafort faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life, or something close to it, in prison.The prosecutors were weighing in Saturday on the sentence that Mr. Manafort will receive from Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington. In that case, Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in September and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.Judge Jackson ruled this month that Mr. Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to prosecutors, including about whether he shared Trump campaign polling data in 2016 with a Russian associate who prosecutors claim has ties to a Russian intelligence service.The prosecutors said Mr. Manafort’s lies fit a long pattern. He deceived “tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice national security division, the F.B.I., the special counsel’s office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, members of Congress and members of the executive branch of the United States government,” the filing said.They noted that he committed crimes “while under a spotlight” as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, after his indictment and after Judge Jackson had released him on bail. Mr. Manafort has been in jail in Northern Virginia since the judge revoked his bail in June, citing the new crimes.Over all, the prosecutors said, Mr. Manafort’s behavior “reflects a hardened adherence to committing crimes and lack of remorse.” Despite his age, they said he “presents a grave risk of recidivism.” They noted that under advisory sentencing guidelines, Mr. Manafort would face a sentence of 17 to 22 years.The prosecutors reached far back into Mr. Manafort’s career in their efforts to portray him as a calculating lawbreaker. They noted that the Justice Department first warned him in 1986 about flouting the lobbying law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA.At the time, Mr. Manafort was a director of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation under President Ronald Reagan, and he was faced with a choice: “either resign his political appointment” or “cease all his activities on behalf of foreign principals,” according to the filing.He chose to resign.But the prosecutors said that “in spite of these clear warnings and the personal ramifications to him for not adhering to the law, Manafort chose to violate the FARA statute and to get others to as well” in his Ukrainian lobbying.Mr. Mueller’s team also made no recommendation on whether Mr. Manafort’s sentence in the Washington case should run concurrently with his sentence in the Virginia case. After a lengthy trial in Alexandria, Va., in August, a jury convicted Mr. Manafort of eight felonies including tax fraud and bank fraud — crimes prosecutors said Mr. Manafort committed “for no other reason than greed.”Sentencing guidelines in that case would call for a prison term of 19 to 24 years.The order of his sentencing dates may work against Mr. Manafort. He is scheduled to be sentenced first for the financial crimes by Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, and then by Judge Jackson in Washington.Some allies of Mr. Manafort had hoped that Judge Ellis would have the last word because he seemed more sympathetic to the defense than Judge Jackson, and he might order the sentences to run concurrently.Kenneth P.

Trump Has Publicly Attacked the Russia Investigation More Than 1,100 Times
By LARRY BUCHANAN and
KAREN YOURISH
FEB. 19, 2019
I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!
The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA
Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?
The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!
Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!
The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even......
find the leakers within the FBI itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW
Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....
...to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story...
...is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total "witch hunt!"
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......
Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!
Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?
Who was it that secretly said to Russian President, "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?" @foxandfriends
For eight years Russia "ran over" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends
James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!
The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!
What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!
Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....
...money to Bill, the Hillary Russian "reset," praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!
Watch @foxandfriends now on Podesta and Russia!
Why doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton - sale of Uranium?
Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!
When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?
It is the same Fake News Media that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!
Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked....
..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated." If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.
The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.
Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. "Spied on before nomination." The real story.
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?
.@FoxNews from multiple sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented." @FBI
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...
...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?
Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.....
...allegations of unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good!
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.
Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.
Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.
Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!
The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?
Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews!
Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer." Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp
The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!
James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.
Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!
Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. "Richie" devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For....
years, as a pol in Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there. When....
caught, he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge & jury. He should be the one who is investigated for his acts.
The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.
Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!
Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.
Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.
James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?
I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....
This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their....
...case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan..." Witch Hunt!
Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.
The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration.
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?
After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians," nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!
I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt
Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.
By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea...
...whether there are "tapes" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!
Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
..under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election." Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!
Wow, CNN had to retract big story on "Russia," with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!
...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....
...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!
.@WashTimes states "Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump."
Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!
HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?
...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."
So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton." So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!
Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....
...big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!
"One of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the Russians collected and spread negative information.....
...about then candidate Trump." Catherine Herridge @FoxNews. So why doesn't Fake News report this? Witch Hunt! Purposely phony reporting.
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security, the tougher the better!
...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!
Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....
...conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?
E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.
@foxandfriends According to report just out, President Obama knew about Russian interference 3 years ago but he didn't want to anger Russia!
James Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!
Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many..
...people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?
As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?
.@foxandfriends "Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation"
Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.
Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!
"Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President." @FoxNews
It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!
Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....
...the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,....
..."collusion," which doesn't exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's...
...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!
All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!
Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd!
Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????
....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!
The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he...
....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!
The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is....
....earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!
Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H....
....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?
The @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch. James Comey's leadership was a disaster!
Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..
...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...
....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!
The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.
The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!
Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Charles McCullough, the respected fmr Intel Comm Inspector General, said public was misled on Crooked Hillary Emails. “Emails endangered National Security.” Why aren't our deep State authorities looking at this? Rigged & corrupt? @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?
Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice!
Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI “agent's role in Clinton probe under review.” Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE” Now it all starts to make sense!
A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
Wow, “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,” according to @FoxNews.
.@FoxNews-FBI's Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”
WOW, @foxandfrlends “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
Crooked Hillary Clinton's top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others
Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!
Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!
Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?” @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!
“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.” This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?
In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!
Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!
Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!
“The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....
...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn't straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” Wall Street Journal
Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!
NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
“My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he's been victimized. He's been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......
....agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don't believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
“Charges Deal Don A Big Win,” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. “She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.”
Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!
Finally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn't I a great candidate?
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo
Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
....The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!
Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!
Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!
“Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!
“Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts” @FoxNews So, what else is new. He is a total phony!
“He's got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton's criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show
“I've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don't see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
“We've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don't see it.” Judge Ken Starr
WITCH HUNT!
Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....
...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!
Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never, no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!” So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......
“Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am still opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!
So sad that the Department of “Justice” and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!
Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD!
What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good!
“The FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....” and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld
Attorney”“client privilege is dead!
A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!
The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story!
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!
If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!
James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....
....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!
The big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more?
Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!
Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus.” Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
So General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?
The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip.” They use....
....it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!
So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!
James Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others?
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr. Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr. Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don't know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!
“At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.” Wall Street Journal
“GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.” @FoxNews Good luck with that request!
A complete Witch Hunt!
Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, “you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there.” Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. “No evidence” that the Trump Campaign “colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.” Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!
“Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN” @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!
It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!
There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!
“The questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone...” Joe Digenova, former US Attorney
NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! “The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump” by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!
A Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal “justice?” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it's called Fighting Back
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ”˜till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!
Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!
Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn't really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!
Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it!
Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!
Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.” Andrew McCarthy says, “There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” If so, this is bigger than Watergate!
Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and “Haters,” but that's the way it is!
“Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit.” David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff!
Why isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a “hot” Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!
Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World's most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!
....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption...
...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!
What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?
....and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they're looking at the rest of the World. Oh' great!
I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!
“John Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....
....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which....
...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself, he's worried about staying out of Jail.” Dan Bongino
The Wall Street Journal asks, “WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?” A very good question!
...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
@foxandfriends “New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?” Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!
“It's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign” Judge Andrew Napolitano
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
“Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign” No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
WITCH HUNT!
Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!
Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax?
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!
“Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.” Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!
With Spies, or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia?
Who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!
Why didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation!
Why didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
“The President deserves some answers.” @FoxNews in discussing “SPYGATE.”
“Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.” Jonathan Turley
“We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
“This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and scandalous.” Mollie Hemingway
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!
Why aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.
The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, I'm President!
Rep.Trey Gowdy, “I don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's....
....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ”˜oh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and that's how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you.....
....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” And I wish I did!
The soon to be released book, “The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump,” written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks.
“The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.” JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.
RUSH LIMBAUGH “If the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren't targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.”
Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!
The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?
Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!
“John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar, he's a liar about being a liar.” Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends
....“$17 million spent, it's a scam Investigation. Americans are being worked. We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats. The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $'s to Crooked H).” Dan Bongino
There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?
Jesse Watters “The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.” So true!
As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of “Justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!
....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired!
Mark Penn “Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.” A disgrace!
As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!
The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!
The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.
What is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!
The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!
Wow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!
Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?
Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch. “They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!
Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: “It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate.” So true!
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?
Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!
When will people start saying, “thank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?”
The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as Comey would call it). Investigate!
Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.
So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!
FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that “we'll stop” candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn't get any lower than that!
The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!
“Why in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)?” asks Mark Levin!
“Donald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey.” Mark Levin
Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!
I've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!
The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!
Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: “This IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein's memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.” Witch Hunt!
WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!
Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn't matter to them!
Why was the FBI's sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we'll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!
“The highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn't it?
Comey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey's best friend. Witch Hunt!
I can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!” Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p
“FBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.” @FoxNews Big News, but the Fake News doesn't want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, “Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy,” which is fantastic. Go get it!
.@FoxNews Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!
The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents?
Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn't this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?
The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
“The most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?” Judge Andrew Napolitano
Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!
Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!
Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!
When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and......
....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...And what is going on in the FBI & DOJ with Crooked Hillary, the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!
Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others), colluded with Russia. They haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the “Special” Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more. It's a Democrat Con Job!
Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!
How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!
As I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews
....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn't Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!
Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!
The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!
While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!
Thank you @RandPaul. “The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed to think?”
So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome!
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!
“Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.” Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don't want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!
The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the ”˜16 Election never ends!
No Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of “Justice” and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!
Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!
Andrew McCarthy - “I said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.” On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!
.@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews “Source #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes, the Dirty Dossier, paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump, and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...” ILLEGAL!
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn't he do something about it? Why didn't he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that's why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!
“It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....
....and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....
.....”Carter Page wasn't a spy, wasn't an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.” Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America. They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now!
“The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump” is a Hot Seller, already Number One! More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!
What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!
.@AlanDersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn't vote for me, has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. He has written a new and very important book...
...called “The Case Against Impeaching Trump,” which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read!
....,the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO,....
.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!
There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!
Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..
....Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama....And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?
Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!
“FBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. He needed an insurance policy. Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election. He should never, ever been allowed to........
.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won't go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.” ALAN DERSHOWITZ....
..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!
Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!
Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!
Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and “Public Enemy Number One,” or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?
“We already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?” Marc Thiessen, Washington Post
Congratulations to @GreggJarrett on The TREMENDOUS success of his just out book, “The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump.” Already number one on Amazon. Hard work from a brilliant guy. It's the Real Story of the Rigged Witch Hunt!
Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book, “THE RUSSIA HOAX, THE ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD TRUMP,” going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon. It is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. Great book!
Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!
...Why aren't Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!
Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS!
“Collusion with Russia was very real. Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians, and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT. We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through....
....a law firm, eventually Kremlin connected sources, to gather info on Donald Trump. Collusion is very real with Russia, but only with Hillary and the Democrats, and we should demand a full investigation.” Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends Looking forward to the new IG Report!
“There has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite, that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.” @GrahamLedger
This is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Phony Dossier, FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 Angry Dems? Stay tuned!
@LindseyGrahamSC “Why didn't the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?” They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?
Jenna Ellis “FBI thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.”
.@MariaBartiromo “No evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians - and here we are, a year and a half later.”
Why isn't the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won't give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.....
.....Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!
The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC....
.@JudgeJeanine “Bob Mueller, isn't your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier, paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump, & used to con a FISA Court Judge. Bob, I really think it's time for you to give up your phony investigation.” No Collusion!
“Seems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President”. @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends If this had happened to the other side, everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time.
Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!
Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch: “The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else. There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok & his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI. We know this...
....guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus. Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. Instead, Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. He used Strzok, he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing....
....should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.” Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn't have said it better myself!
Bruce Ohr of the “Justice” Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele “find dirt on Trump.” Ohr's wife, Nelly, was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier. @foxandfriends
“They were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn't do.” Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people.
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn't this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?
Lou Dobbs: “This cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou, so true!
The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!
“The action (the Strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey's skinny inner circle.” Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director.
“John Brennan is a stain on the Country, we deserve better than this.” Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book, “Spygate, the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,” Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan, and good luck with the book!
“Hillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI. We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump” concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt. JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.
Mark Levin “When they had power they didn't stop the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, they funded the Iranians & are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election & trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.”
“I'd strip the whole bunch of them. They're all corrupt. They've all abused their power. They've all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States.” @seanhannity
“The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department & whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).” Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.
“While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.” Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words, they were colluding with Russia!
“Very concerned about Comey's firing, afraid they will be exposed,” said Bruce Ohr. DOJ's Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr's connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!
.@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: “How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?” Now that is a really good question! Then followed by “Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...” So true, a total Fake!
How can “Senator” Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? Loser!
“....An incredibly corrupt FBI & DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election. Brennan has gone off the deep end, he's disgraced and discredited himself. His conduct has been outrageous.” Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch.
“Director Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. If Director Brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA, why didn't he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment......
.....released in 2017. If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach......” Richard Burr (R-NC) Senate Intel Cmte Chair @LouDobbs
“Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.” Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED!
“Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it's astonishing that he's still employed. Bruce & Nelly Ohr's bank account is getting fatter & fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling. He doesn't disclose it under Fed Regs. Using your Federal office for personal.......
....financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation, Bribery Statute Violation, Honest Services Violation....all Major Crimes....because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions......” Gregg Jarrett. So when does Mueller do what must be done? Probably never! @FoxNews
All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China. But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!
Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!
President Trump has publicly criticized dozens of people and groups related to federal inquiries into contacts between his campaign and Russia, according to a New York Times analysis of nearly every public statement or Twitter post that he has made while in office.

The attacks, which number nearly 1,200, are part of a strategy to beat back the investigations. They have also opened him to possible obstruction of justice charges. They include statements made on Twitter, in official speeches, at rallies and during news media interviews and other press events.
While it is highly unusual for anyone — let alone the president of the United States — to comment on continuing criminal investigations, Mr. Trump has done so at least once on 330 days, or more than 43 percent of his time in office as of Feb. 14.

Mr. Trump has employed a wide range of attacks in what appears to be an attempt to discredit the people and organizations associated with the investigations.
According to the president, the inquiry by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 election is the “single greatest witch hunt in political history.”

Trump has described Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman — who has been convicted of 10 felonies and is awaiting sentencing — as a “very decent man” and “honorable person.”
The president has also said he felt “badly” for Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.
Mr. Trump praised Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime associate who has pleaded not guilty to felony charges in the special counsel investigation, for having “guts” for saying he would refuse to testify against him.
And Mr. Trump called his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., a “good boy” who did nothing wrong in arranging a meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.
But whom or what does he defend the most? President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia.

Cohen, scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May, has met with prosecutors about possible irregularities at the Trump Organization.CreditCreditSusan Walsh/Associated PressBy Ben Protess, William K. Rashbaum and Maggie HabermanFeb. 22, 2019Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, met last month with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, offering information about possible irregularities within the president’s family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization for a decade, spoke with the prosecutors about insurance claims the company had filed over the years, said the people, who did not elaborate on the nature of the possible irregularities.While it was not clear whether the prosecutors found Mr. Cohen’s information credible and whether they intended to pursue it, the meeting suggests that they are interested in broader aspects of the Trump Organization, beyond their investigation into the company’s role in the hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women claiming to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last summer to arranging those payments.The prosecutors also questioned Mr. Cohen about a donor to the president’s inaugural committee, Imaad Zuberi, a California venture capitalist and political fund-raiser, according to the people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential meeting. Around the time that Mr. Zuberi contributed $900,000 to the committee, he also tried to hire Mr. Cohen as a consultant and wrote him a substantial check, one of the people said.Although Mr. Cohen did not go through with the arrangement, he was building a consulting business at the time with clients who sought to understand and have access to the Trump administration.A spokesman for Mr. Zuberi, Steve Rabinowitz, confirmed the check on Friday, saying it was for $100,000 and never cashed. Mr. Zuberi, the only person directly referenced in a recent subpoena the prosecutors sent the inaugural committee, had previously denied having any dealings with Mr. Cohen beyond a few conversations.There was no indication that Mr. Cohen, who is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May, implicated Mr. Trump in the possible irregularities discussed during the meeting last month. If prosecutors concluded that Mr. Cohen’s information was truthful and valuable, they could ask the judge who sentenced him to reduce his prison term.The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A spokeswoman at the company did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, the president has accused Mr. Cohen of lying to try to reduce his sentence.Lanny Davis, a lawyer and adviser to Mr. Cohen, would not comment on the investigations beyond saying that his client was “interested in cooperating with and assisting” the prosecutors “in any way they believe is helpful.”A spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, known as the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.The prosecutors recently sought to interview Trump Organization executives, according to a person briefed on the request, which was previously reported by CNN. The nature of the questions they were seeking to ask was not known.So far, Mr. Cohen is the only person sentenced to significant prison time in various investigations connected to Mr. Trump.In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws for his role in the hush money payments, as well as tax and bank crimes. In a separate case brought by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about the timing of negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow, and about the extent of Mr. Trump’s involvement in the plans.In a memo to the court before he was sentenced in December, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers wrote that he was being disproportionately punished for “conduct that is routinely pursued through noncriminal enforcement,” referring to his admission of tax evasion. His lawyers drew a comparison to celebrities who received either fines or far less time after being charged with extensive tax fraud.The session with the Southern District prosecutors was not the first time Mr. Cohen provided information that could possibly lead to a reduced sentence. Earlier, Mr. Cohen met twice with the prosecutors to assist their investigation of the payments to women, including the Trump Organization’s decision to reimburse Mr. Cohen for $130,000 he paid to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.In an interview in December, Mr. Cohen told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that he was “done with the lying.” He went on: “I am done being loyal to President Trump, and my first loyalty belongs to my wife, my daughter, my son and this country.Federal law allows prosecutors to seek — and a judge to grant — a reduced prison term for a defendant who offers “substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person” within a year of being sentenced. The same rule would also allow the judge to consider assistance Mr. Cohen provided, before his sentencing, to the special counsel. Last year, he met seven times with prosecutors from Mr. Mueller’s office.The continued scrutiny of the Trump family business and inaugural committee from the Southern District comes as Mr. Mueller is said to be wrapping up his investigation. Once he completes a report with his findings, various aspects of his investigation are expected to live on in the Southern District and other United States attorneys offices.Mr. Cohen declined to seek a formal cooperation deal with the Southern District, which would have required him to disclose any crimes he had committed or had been aware of, and would have delayed his sentencing. His decision to forgo such an agreement most likely contributed to the severity of his sentence; his lawyer had argued for no prison time.Mr. Trump had offered a different view, saying late last year that Mr. Cohen should serve a “full and complete” prison sentence. And as Mr. Cohen remained in the spotlight as a likely witness before Congress, Mr. Trump intensified his attacks on his former employee, urging prosecutors and the media to scrutinize Mr. Cohen’s family.The attacks led Mr. Cohen to postpone a planned appearance before the House oversight committee earlier this month. But this week, the committee announced that the testimony was back on for next Wednesday and that Democrats planned to question Mr. Cohen about “the president’s business practices.”Mr. Cohen has also agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.Mr. Cohen was originally scheduled to begin his prison term next month, but his lawyers cited the congressional testimony — as well as recent shoulder surgery — as a reason for a two-month delay. The judge overseeing Mr. Cohen’s case granted the request on Wednesday.Benjamin Weiser contributed reporting.

Stone Jr. that if he violated her order, she would revoke his bail and put him behind bars for the duration of his trial.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Sharon LaFraniereFeb. 21, 2019WASHINGTON — First, Roger J. Stone Jr. said he did not look at the photo of a federal judge, with an image of cross hairs in the corner by her head, before he posted it on Instagram on Monday. Then, testifying under oath on Thursday in front of the same judge, he acknowledged that he had looked at the photo before he posted it, but said a volunteer had chosen it.Finally, Mr. Stone, who is under indictment on charges brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said he had picked out the photo from a group of several that were provided to him by a volunteer he could not name.During a 90-minute hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, Amy Berman Jackson, the judge in the photograph, was having none of it. Openly incredulous at Mr. Stone’s inconsistent explanations of the Instagram post, she issued a gag order intended to force him into public silence about the criminal case against him.She warned him that if he violated her order, she would revoke his bail and put him behind bars for the duration of his trial. “This is not baseball,” she said sternly. “There will be no third chance. If you cannot abide by this, I will be forced to change your surroundings so you have no temptations.”For one of the few times in his 40-year career as a Republican political trickster, provocateur and attack dog, the irrepressibly loquacious Mr. Stone had nothing to say in reply.Mr. Stone, a former Trump campaign aide and longtime friend of the president, faces felony charges of obstruction of justice, witness tampering and making false statements in a case stemming from the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Stone deceived the House Intelligence Committee about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential election and that he tried to pressure another witness to lie to the committee.Since the F.B.I. agents raided his house four weeks ago, he has remained defiant, protesting his innocence and casting himself as the helpless victim of a rigged prosecution. His public campaign culminated on Monday with the Instagram post, an attack on Judge Jackson as an appointee of President Barack Obama who would preside over “my upcoming show trial.” He asked for contributions to his defense fund to combat the “legal trickery” of “hitman Robert Mueller.”On the stand, he abandoned his typical combativeness, repeatedly apologizing to the judge for what he called an inexcusable, egregious error of judgment.“I am kicking myself over my own stupidity,” he said. “Forgive me the trespass.”He said he was suffering from extreme emotional and financial stress. His savings were exhausted, he said, and his business as a public commentator and consultant, which once earned him $47,000 a month, had dwindled badly.“I am having trouble putting food on the table and paying the rent,” he said.He said he posted the Instagram image without thinking that a photograph of Judge Jackson that appeared to include the cross hairs of a gun sight might threaten the safety of the judge or others. “I can’t rationalize my thinking because I wasn’t thinking,” he said.The judge firmly rejected that explanation. As a veteran political propagandist, she said, “Roger Stone fully understands the power of words and the power of symbols.” She added, “There is nothing ambiguous about cross hairs.”Judge Jackson said Mr. Stone was so obviously eager for public attention that only a strict gag order would curb him from using his public platform to incite his followers with incendiary comments. Although he insisted he was deeply sorry for his actions, she said his apologies rang “hollow.” And she said his “evolving” story about the origin of the Instagram post was not credible.“Mr. Stone could not even keep his story straight on the stand, much less from one day to another,” she said. The lead prosecutor in the case, Jonathan Ian Kravis, an assistant United States attorney, also accused Mr. Stone of dissembling when he insisted that he could not remember who might have given him photos of Judge Jackson to choose from.“You cannot remember the names of all the volunteers who worked for you four days ago?” he asked.Mr. Stone’s post came days after Judge Jackson had restricted Mr. Stone from making public statements on the courthouse steps that “pose a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to this case.” Her new order imposes the same restrictions on him that she has placed on lawyers in the case.“From this moment on, the defendant may not speak publicly about this case — period. No statements about the case on TV, radio, print reporters or internet. No posts on social media,” Judge Jackson said. She said her order also applied to surrogates who might speak on Mr. Stone’s behalf.She said Mr. Stone could continue to seek donations to his legal defense fund, but could note only that he had pleaded not guilty — without commenting on the judge, the prosecutors, the witnesses or anyone involved in the case.Mr. Stone first modified, then deleted his Instagram post on Monday, but screen shots of it circulated widely on social media. “In the world of social media,” Judge Jackson said, “there is no such thing as a take back.”Even after he deleted the message, she said, Mr. Stone continued to discuss it with reporters, guaranteeing that it received even more attention. He first said the cross hairs were simply the logo of the website where he had found the photograph of the judge, then said they were a “Celtic symbol,” then called them an “occult symbol.”Judge Jackson said she would set a trial date soon and urged Mr. Stone to focus on the legal jeopardy he faces, not on stoking up his followers or keeping himself in the public eye.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Puts Strict Gag Order on Stone, Unimpressed by His Apologies.

Cohen leaving Federal District Court in New York in December. Lawmakers said they would limit the scope of their questioning.CreditCreditStephanie Keith for The New York TimesBy Nicholas FandosFeb. 20, 2019WASHINGTON — Michael D. Cohen has agreed to testify in public next Wednesday before Congress about his work as President Trump’s personal lawyer and longtime fixer, but lawmakers said they would limit the scope of their questioning in deference to the special counsel.The hearing next week before the House Oversight and Reform Committee will give Mr. Cohen, once one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal aides, a rare public platform to try to explain his work for the president, including an illegal scheme during the 2016 campaign to pay hush money to two women claiming to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. And it promises to provide House Democrats investigating Mr. Trump, his business and his administration with early fireworks to punctuate their efforts.But Mr. Cohen — who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, tax fraud and a campaign finance violation in the hush money scheme — will also face intense scrutiny from Republicans, who have already indicated that they plan to aggressively challenge his past work and credibility as a witness against the president.The committee’s chairman indicated that after consultation with the Justice Department and the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Cohen would not be allowed to discuss matters related to Russia, including a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow under scrutiny by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“Congress has an obligation under the Constitution to conduct independent and robust oversight of the executive branch, and this hearing is one step in that process,” the chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement announcing the rescheduled hearing.In a two-page memo released late Wednesday, Mr. Cummings outlined 10 topics that he said would be addressed, including “the president’s debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election” and his compliance with federal tax and campaign finance laws. Other topics were more open-ended, including Mr. Trump’s business practices and possible conflicts of interest, as well as the “accuracy of the president’s public statements.”Lanny J. Davis, one of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, told ABC News that his client intended to share “personal, front-line experiences of memories, and incidents, and conduct, and comments that Donald Trump said over that 10-year time period behind closed doors.”Mr. Cohen had intimate access to Mr. Trump as a businessman and during the 2016 presidential campaign. But since he came under the scrutiny of federal investigators, Mr. Cohen has implicated Mr. Trump in court in the hush money scheme and spent more than 70 hours with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York and those working for Mr. Mueller.On Twitter on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen said he was “Looking forward to the #American people hearing my story in my voice!” He included a link to a GoFundMe page raising money for the “Michael Cohen Truth Fund.”The public hearing is one of three sessions Mr. Cohen will have next week on Capitol Hill. He is also scheduled to participate in private deposition-style interviews with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, where he is likely to be pressed on matters pertaining to Russia and other potential efforts by foreign powers to gain influence over Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to the two intelligence committees about the Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow.Before that, in August, Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and the campaign finance violation. He said in court at the time that the last violation was the result of payments he made at Mr. Trump’s behest during the 2016 campaign to two women to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen had been expected to report early next month to begin serving a three-year prison sentence, but on Wednesday, a federal judge in Manhattan said that he could delay that appearance by two months, to May 6. In requesting the delay, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers said he had undergone recent shoulder surgery and needed to take part in physical therapy.If Democrats are hoping that Mr. Cohen’s testimony will damage Mr. Trump’s public image, Republicans have been laying the groundwork to try to undercut Mr. Cohen’s credibility first. In a letter to Mr. Cummings on Tuesday, the oversight committee’s top Republicans referred to Mr. Cohen as “an admitted serial liar” and accused the Democrats of putting on a political show.“When Cohen appears before our committee, we can only assume that he will continue his pattern of deceit and perjury,” the Republicans, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, wrote. “Although Cohen falsely attributes his crimes to ‘blind loyalty to Donald Trump,’ a federal judge correctly noted that Cohen’s crimes were all motivated by his personal greed and ambition.”Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly suggested that Mr. Cohen lied to prosecutors about him to reduce his own prison sentence. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, abruptly shifted his own assessment of Mr. Cohen’s honesty after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and began talking to prosecutors.It was another comment by Mr. Trump — who during a Fox News interview in January cryptically called for Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law to be investigated — that prompted Mr. Cohen to initially postpone the oversight hearing, which was originally scheduled for Feb. 7.Democrats seized on the threats, asserting that Mr. Cohen had been “intimidated” from testifying to Congress by the president — an action that could be construed as a crime. Mr. Trump denied that he had done anything of the sort.Benjamin Weiser and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.

Mr. Manafort will turn 70 in early April.Disputing the prosecutors’ damning characterization of Mr. Manafort in a court filing last week, his lawyers insisted that Mr. Manafort was not only deeply remorseful, but “has suffered almost unprecedented public shame” for what they called garden-variety offenses. The memos are previews of the oral arguments that both sides will make before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who will sentence Mr. Manafort for the two conspiracy charges on March 13.Judge Jackson’s sentence will come five days after Mr. Manafort is sentenced for eight more felonies he was found guilty of last year in a related financial fraud case before Judge T.S. Ellis III of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. A key question for both sides is whether Mr. Manafort will be allowed to serve the prison terms simultaneously, or whether they will be stacked atop each other.ImageMembers of Mr. Manafort’s defense team, from left, Richard Westling, Tim Wang and Kevin Downing, arriving at federal court in Washington this month.CreditErik S Lesser/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Manafort’s lawyers asked that Judge Jackson’s sentence be “significantly below” the 10-year maximum prison term she could impose. But whatever punishment she decides upon, they asked that Mr. Manafort be allowed to serve it concurrently with his sentence in the Virginia case. Under advisory sentencing guidelines, Mr. Manafort could be sentenced to more than 24 years in prison for the financial fraud scheme.The defense team argued that had the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, never been appointed to investigate Russian interference in the election, “Mr. Manafort might never have been indicted in the District of Columbia.”Even though Mr. Manafort has admitted his guilt in the conspiracy crimes, they said, Mr. Mueller’s team had pursued him with unusual vigor because he led Mr. Trump’s campaign during a critical period in 2016. He is one of the few defendants, they noted, to have ever been charged with a crime for failing to register as a foreign lobbyist with the Justice Department.In their sentencing memo, unsealed on Saturday, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors asked for no specific sentence. But they said that Mr. Manafort had “repeatedly and brazenly” violated a host of laws for more than a decade, that he had admitted to leading a conspiracy that encompassed serious crimes including money-laundering and obstruction of justice, and that he should be sentenced to a substantial prison term.The defense lawyers dismissed the prosecutors’ argument that Mr. Manafort was likely to commit new crimes unless he received a lengthy sentence. “The special counsel’s attempt to portray him as a lifelong and irredeemable felon is beyond the pale and grossly overstates the facts,” they said. Mr. Manafort has been “vilified in a manner that this country has not experienced in decades,” they said.They also suggested that Mr. Manafort should not be punished more harshly than Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and longtime fixer. Mr. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, five counts of tax evasion, one count of false submissions to a bank and two campaign finance violations.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Saying Manafort Has Been Unfairly ‘Vilified,’ His Lawyers Argue for Leniency.

Cohen’s explosive testimony this week about President Trump’s potentially felonious conduct has not moved House Democratic leaders closer to initiating impeachment proceedings against the president, with top lawmakers preferring to pursue multiple intertwined inquiries as they await the results of the special counsel’s investigation.Democrats on Thursday emphasized their intent to explore and broadcast Mr. Trump’s actions through existing investigations, believing that, lacking startling new evidence, a drawn-out gantlet of inquiries will do more damage to a president seeking re-election than a partisan impeachment that could only roil the country and energize Republicans — a thousand cuts over a swing of the ax.“Yes, we have unambiguous evidence that the president has committed a crime at this point, I think,” Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. “Do we have unambiguous evidence he has done impeachable offenses? We’ve got a ways to go yet.”Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has steadfastly pushed back against calls to try to impeach Mr. Trump, told reporters that impeachment was “a divisive issue in our country,” and that she was more concerned with the president’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border.The findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will significantly influence how they proceed, top House Democrats cautioned, but at the moment their preparations for battle are focused almost exclusively on unearthing new facts and challenging the Justice Department for access to the evidence that Mr. Mueller has gathered, not on meting out punishment.Democratic pollsters who once helped assemble guidance for talking about the importance of the special counsel investigation are developing new polling to help lawmakers reframe the debate on presidential wrongdoing around Mr. Mueller’s possible conclusion, to lay the groundwork for continued investigations and to push back against the attempts by the president’s allies to play down the significance of wrongdoing.“It should be the last thing on members’ minds,” Representative Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said about impeachment. “You have to be patient and you have to be practical. You don’t stop a criminal investigation when you have enough. You stop when you have learned everything there is to be learned.”The resistance to impeachment puts the leadership at odds with some rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists and a significant portion of Democratic voters who believe that sufficient evidence already exists to start the process of ousting the president. As House inquiries proceed, pressure will mount on Ms. Pelosi and other top Democrats to take action against Mr. Trump.“There are only two questions left: How deep is the corruption and what do you want to do about it?” said Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has crusaded for Mr. Trump’s impeachment and poured millions into organizing for town halls and national advertising to pressure Democratic lawmakers.Mr. Cohen’s testimony only made that message more urgent, he said: “You cannot uphold the rule of law and say we are not going to prosecute the president, we are not going to hold him to account, we are going to throw out the Constitution because it is politically awkward for us, because it makes us harder in an election.”Democratic strategists say they do not yet see signs that Mr. Steyer is swaying the broader public, and they view impeachment as a politically dangerous move that could backfire on the party and help Mr. Trump and Republicans in next year’s elections. The window to open an impeachment inquiry may be closing fast. By the 2020 election year, even Democrats would most likely say the American people should decide Mr. Trump’s fate at the polls.But by this fall, with Democratic presidential hopefuls making the rounds in Iowa, the campaign to unseat the president will be well underway, and Democrats may decide they would rather face an embattled Mr. Trump than a Mike Pence elevated to the presidency, however remote that possibility would be.ImageDemocrats may ultimately decide they would rather face an embattled Mr. Trump in 2020 than a Mike Pence elevated to the presidency.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe impeachment of Bill Clinton came just after a midterm election. Richard M. Nixon resigned more than two years before the next presidential election, and was serving in his second term anyway.Mr. Nadler, whose committee would be tasked with overseeing impeachment proceedings, has consistently said that he would not even consider starting an impeachment process without significant Republican backing. The fierce Republican attack on Mr. Cohen at Wednesday’s hearing showed that has not materialized at this point.Lawmakers leery of impeachment say that Democrats would be better served by expanding their investigations into the president’s possible connections to Russian interference in the 2016 election, payments of hush money to women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump, the pursuit of Russian business deals and the financial benefits that he may be reaping from his office.In something of an encore to Mr. Cohen’s testimony, Democrats were already preparing to hold an open hearing with Felix Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump, on March 14. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the hearing would focus on a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.In the meantime, Democrats have been lining up arguments to ensure that they can ultimately gain access to all of the evidence gathered by the federal investigators under Mr. Mueller.Mr. Nadler said he was fearful that the Justice Department would try to contort its policies against indicting a sitting president and sharing information about uncharged individuals to justify withholding key evidence against Mr. Trump from Congress. He and other Democratic chairmen are prepared to issue subpoenas and fight in court if need be.“We all believe in the separation of powers,” Mr. Nadler said. “If you are saying the judiciary cannot hold a sitting president accountable because he cannot be indicted, then Congress has to. It is the only other one that can.”A full-blown impeachment inquiry carries special weight and symbolism and would open the door to Mr. Trump and Republicans saying he is being unfairly pursued by overreaching Democrats.After Wednesday’s hearing, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the Maryland Democrat who leads the Oversight Committee, noted that the “I-word” was mentioned only by Republicans during the questioning of Mr. Cohen.“I want to proceed very cautiously,” he said. “But isn’t it interesting, not one person, not one person on our side even mentioned the word impeachment? Not one. Not one. They did, but not us.”As the hearing demonstrated, Republicans are already trying to use impeachment as an issue against the Democrats. They said Mr. Cohen’s high-profile appearance, carried start to finish on television, was a spectacle intended to lay the groundwork for a coming impeachment hearing.“They are not wanting to tip their hand because there is still hope against hope that impeachment will come up, but they are trying to find an alternative, which is this endless cycle of investigations,” said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee.Outside of leadership, other Democrats say impeachment of Mr. Trump is practically inevitable as the inquiries proceed.“I think it is almost going to be impossible not to deal with because so much has come up and so much will be revealed,” said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee who has introduced his own articles of impeachment. “These investigations are the precursor to impeachment. I don’t see a downside. I think that the facts will lead you to the ultimate conclusion that it is necessary.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Democratic Leaders Are Leaning Away From Initiating Impeachment.

That’s absurd.” — July 24, 2016 Donald Trump: “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia.

Why would there be?” — Jan. 15, 2017Act II: Contacts Discovered “There were contacts,” according to a Russian official. — N.Y.

Times, Jan. 26, 2019Act III: Russia’s Role “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.” — U.S. Intelligence Community assessment, Jan. 6, 2017Russian agents purchased advertising on Facebook and distributed inflammatory posts that reached at least 126 million Facebook users. The Russians published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos on YouTube. — Statements by the companies prepared for congressional hearings, October 2017.Russian intelligence conspired “to gain unauthorized access (to ‘hack’) into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” — Indictment of 12 Russians, July 13, 2018Act IV: ConfessionPresident Trump acknowledges that even as his presidential campaign was underway in 2016, his business was in discussions with Russia about building a Trump property in Moscow. — N.Y. Times interview, Jan. 31, 2019Paul Manafort tells prosecutors on undisclosed date or dates that he had repeated talks with a Russian, Konstantin Kilimnik, who is believed to have ties to Russian military intelligence. Kilimnik flew to New York for one crucial dinner meeting on Aug. 2, 2016, while Manafort was Trump’s campaign chairman, and they discussed a peace proposal for Ukraine that would resolve the dispute over Putin’s intervention there. This issue was high on Putin’s agenda.Manafort may also have handed over confidential polling data to Kilimnik; it’s not clear if this could have been used for Russian interference in the U.S. election.A federal prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, says on Feb. 4, 2019, “This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel’s office is investigating.”Manafort and Kilimnik left the Aug. 2 meeting separately by different exits.ImageMichael Cohen leaving federal court in Manhattan in November.CreditJulie Jacobson/Associated Press“I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the fateful day that I accepted the offer to work for a famous real estate mogul whose business acumen I truly admired. … It was my own weakness, and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.“It is for these reasons I chose to participate in the illicit act of the president rather than to listen to my own inner voice, which should have warned me that the campaign finance violations that I later pled guilty to were insidious. … Most all, I want to apologize to the people of the United States. You deserve to know the truth, and lying to you was unjust.” — Michael Cohen, statement to the court, Dec. 12, 2018, after earlier confessing to lying to Congress about Trump’s investment interest in RussiaTo the AudienceA recent Washington Post/Schar poll found that 43 percent of Americans still are skeptical that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. That should no longer be in doubt.What isn’t clear is the role that the Trump campaign played, if any, in that interference.What we do know is that there were more than 100 contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign; moreover, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has shown that four people in Trump’s orbit lied about contacts with Moscow.Unlike a play, the stakes here are enormous: This drama is about the integrity of America’s political system. We should be careful about assuming we can predict the ending, but I keep coming back to Vice President Pence’s excellent question when he denied — falsely — that there had been any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign: “Why would there be?”RElatedMore on Donald Trump and RussiaOpinion | The Editorial Board: For Decades, the United States and Russia Stepped Back From the Brink.

Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, on Tuesday in Washington.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos and Maggie HabermanFeb. 26, 2019WASHINGTON — Michael D. Cohen plans to tell Congress on Wednesday that President Trump is a “con man” and a “cheat” who knew a longtime adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks — and who implicitly instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about a Trump Tower project in Moscow that was underway during the 2016 presidential campaign.The extraordinary testimony will take place when Mr. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer, publicly appears before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. An advance copy of Mr. Cohen’s testimony was obtained Tuesday night by reporters at multiple news organizations, including The New York Times, just as Mr. Trump began meetings in Vietnam before convening with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.[Read the opening statement. Find what to watch for here.]Mr. Cohen and his lawyer and adviser, Lanny J. Davis, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.In a statement earlier Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, condemned Mr. Cohen as a “disgraced felon.”“It’s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,” she said.In vivid and at times tortured language, Mr. Cohen plans to use his opening remarks to unspool a narrative laced with regret of his decade working alongside Mr. Trump, including episodes during the 2016 campaign that are believed to be at the center of investigations by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and federal prosecutors in New York.The testimony underscores many of the unsavory themes and stories that have recurred in public reporting about Mr. Trump — he inflates his wealth, makes racist remarks, threatens his enemies and tries to bend the law to his favor — but puts them on the record, under oath, in the voice of a man who was one of Mr. Trump’s closest aides.“I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,” Mr. Cohen plans to say. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat.”But there are also more perilous claims that could further highlight Mr. Trump’s potential legal exposure in the investigations that have already ensnared Mr. Cohen and other Trump associates. Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the Oversight Committee will be his first in public, before Congress, but he has already spent more than 70 hours with Mr. Mueller’s investigators and with federal prosecutors in New York investigating a scheme hatched in the run-up to the 2016 election to make hush money payments to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen and his account will be subjected to deep scrutiny by Republicans, who have already begun to hammer away with questions about his past business dealings and credibility. They plan to use Wednesday’s hearing to paint Mr. Cohen as self-centered and untrustworthy — a man who ran afoul of the law, including by lying to Congress once before, and then once he was caught, sought to spin lies about his former boss to reduce his time in prison.Mr. Cohen will address his own past lies head-on and plans to use documents to try to bolster certain claims. He plans to draw a picture of Mr. Trump using the type of nonspecific directives more often associated with organized crime bosses than with American presidents.“In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,” Mr. Cohen plans to say. “In his way, he was telling me to lie.”He will add: “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.”Mr. Cohen also plans to say that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers approved his testimony, suggesting that they signed off on him telling a false version of events to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Mr. Cohen is meeting with both committees again in private this week in part to correct those earlier false statements.“Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,” Mr. Cohen will say. “He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.”How Trump Fits Into, and Denies, Cohen’s NarrativeWednesday’s congressional hearing is focusing in part on how much Trump knew about hush money payments and a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.What Mr. Trump said to Mr. Cohen has emerged as a central question, after the website BuzzFeed reported last month that Mr. Mueller had evidence that the president had “personally directed” his former lawyer to lie about the project when he testified before Congress in 2017. Mr. Mueller’s office called the report “inaccurate.”Mr. Cohen’s account under oath will state that something took place, but not that Mr. Trump made an overt directive.Mr. Cohen will also tell Congress that Mr. Trump had advance knowledge through his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. that WikiLeaks would publish hacked emails that would damage his opponent, Hillary Clinton.“In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,” his written remarks say. “Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‘wouldn’t that be great.’”Mr. Stone, who was recently indicted on charges that include witness tampering and false statements to Congress, has denied to reporters that such a conversation took place. The recent indictment against him made no mention of such a conversation, but it did state that a senior campaign official was directed to contact Mr. Stone around that period of time about what material WikiLeaks had.And Mr. Cohen will reference a conversation he claims to have observed between the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his father, which he believes happened around the time of a planned meeting with a Russian lawyer promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.He does not claim to have heard a direct reference to the meeting. Instead, Mr. Cohen will say, he recalled this event after The Times revealed the June 2016 meeting had taken place.“I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying, ‘The meeting is all set.’ I remember Mr. Trump saying, “O.K. good … let me know,’” Mr. Cohen will say.CNN reported last year, citing sources, that Mr. Cohen had witnessed the younger Mr. Trump describing the meeting with the Russian lawyer to his father. Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Mr. Davis, later said he had provided information for that report and that it was erroneous.Much of what Mr. Cohen will say about the hush money payments he made at Mr. Trump’s behest in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign has already been revealed in Federal Court or in news reports after Mr. Cohen was charged with a campaign finance violation for the scheme. But he will describe a surreal scene in the Oval Office, just a month into Mr. Trump’s term, in which the president assured Mr. Cohen that reimbursement checks for the illegal payments were on their way.Mr. Cohen will chronicle less legally dubious but unflattering encounters, as well, according to the prepared remarks. He plans to say that as a candidate, Mr. Trump directed him to write letters to his high school, college and other entities threatening them not to release transcripts of his standardized test scores.He will claim that Mr. Trump asked him to put off reporters asking about his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft, telling Mr. Cohen privately that there were no medical records of the bone spurs that he has said affected his heel.“You think I’m stupid? I wasn’t going to Vietnam,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Cohen.And he will assert that “it was my experience” that Mr. Trump inflated his wealth to garner attention, and deflated his assets to lower his tax bills.Mr. Cohen plans to describe his former boss as a jumble of conflicts, but one who is ultimately a dishonorable person.“Mr. Trump is an enigma,” Mr. Cohen will say. “He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself.”Detailing the hush money payments to the actress that Mr. Cohen was reimbursed for, he will state the affair as fact and will say that lying to Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, is something he deeply regrets. “She is a kind, good person,” he will say. “I respect her greatly, and she did not deserve that.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Related CoverageOn Eve of Michael Cohen’s Testimony, Republican Threatens to Reveal Compromising InformationFeb. 26, 2019ImageStay Tuned for a Trump Split Screen Featuring Cohen and KimFeb. 25, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsRoger Stone Posted a Photo of a Judge Beside Cross Hairs.

Stone Jr.’s criminal case on Tuesday ordered a hearing to consider revoking his bail after he posted a photo on Instagram of the judge with what appeared to be the cross hairs of a gun near her head.The judge, Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, asked Mr. Stone, a longtime adviser for President Trump, to explain to her at the hearing, set for Thursday, why she should not modify his gag order or otherwise change the conditions of his release in light of the Instagram post.Mr. Stone had suggested in the post that Judge Jackson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, would be biased in presiding over his case. Screenshots of the post, which was later deleted, circulated rapidly on social media on Monday.Roger Stone now directly attacking the federal judge presiding over his case and posting a pic of her head beside crosshairs pic.twitter.com/ze3lnuoSOE— Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) February 18, 2019
Last week, Judge Jackson imposed a limited gag order on Mr. Stone, ordering that he must refrain, in the vicinity of the courthouse, from talking to the news media or making statements that “pose a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to this case.” Lawyers and witnesses in the case are prohibited from making those sorts of statements anywhere.Judge Jackson wrote in the order that she believed the gag order was appropriate because of the risk that “public pronouncements” by those involved in the case could inflame the crowds that have gathered outside the court proceedings.She added that the narrow gag order imposed on Mr. Stone could be altered, a point that she reiterated on Tuesday in the wake of the Instagram post.In a court filing on Monday, Mr. Stone apologized for the post, writing that the “photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted.”“I had no intention of disrespecting the Court and humbly apologize to the Court for the transgression,” he said.But in statements posted to his Instagram account, he took a different tone. He said that the photo of Judge Jackson had been “misinterpreted” and was a “random photo taken from the internet.” He also claimed that the image of cross hairs was the logo of the website where he had found the photo.Mr. Stone told The Washington Post, meanwhile, that the symbol near Judge Jackson’s head was a “Celtic symbol.” And on a broadcast with the conspiracy site Infowars, he referred to the image as an “occult symbol.”The Instagram post was not the first time Mr. Stone had transformed his court proceedings into a spectacle. As he emerged from a courthouse after his arrest, he threw up his arms in Richard M. Nixon’s trademark double “V” sign.Reached by email on Tuesday, Mr. Stone said that he had no comment beyond his additional Instagram posts and that he planned to attend Thursday’s hearing.Last month, Mr. Stone pleaded not guilty to felony charges in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was charged with obstruction of justice, witness tampering and making false statements.Mr. Mueller’s indictment accused Mr. Stone of lying to investigators for the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own inquiry into the Russian election interference campaign, and of pressuring another witness in that investigation to lie to the committee.The indictment also said that Trump campaign officials dispatched Mr. Stone to make contact with WikiLeaks during the summer of 2016, when the website was releasing a trove of damaging information about Hillary Clinton that had been stolen by Russian intelligence operatives.Mr. Stone has fiercely declared his innocence, saying he was “prepared to fight for my life” during the trial.According to the order setting Mr. Stone’s conditions of release, filed in January, he is out on bond.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said in an interview that Judge Jackson had broad discretion under criminal law to penalize Mr. Stone for his behavior. She could decide to simply give him a stern lecture in court, or she could revoke his bail, Professor Tobias said.“I think it’s pretty clear that you cannot threaten a federal judge,” he said. “Every lawyer in federal court knows that.” Follow Julia Jacobs on Twitter: @juliarebeccaj.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Stone Is Summoned to Court For Instagram Post on Judge.

Cohen made it personal.In sworn testimony on Wednesday to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, he painted President Trump, the man he used to revere, as a con man, a cheat and a racist. His words were blunt and salacious and outlined a vivid bill of particulars against the president of the United States.Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and CriminalityFeb. 27, 2019Testimony From Cohen Could Compound Legal Issues for TrumpFeb. 27, 2019Trump Exaggerated His Wealth in Bid for Loan, Michael Cohen Tells CongressFeb. 27, 2019Mr. Cohen offered new details into Trump World, namely that Mr. Trump directed him to lie about a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, and he implicated the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and the chief financial officer of Mr. Trump’s company, Allen Weisselberg, in the arrangement of those payments. Mr. Cohen also said that people around the president were involved in persuading Mr. Cohen to change the date he gave about when the discussions for a Moscow-based Trump Tower project ended during the 2016 presidential campaign, an assertion that one of the president’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, denounced as “completely false.”“I have fixed things, but I am no longer your ‘fixer,’ Mr. Trump,” Mr. Cohen said.Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Cohen’s testimony.The president faces peril having nothing to do with Russia.Mr. Cohen’s testimony did not provide conclusive proof that incriminates the president on possible collusion with Russia. On another matter, though — one that is the province of federal prosecutors in New York and not that of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — Mr. Cohen’s testimony and documents could prove far more damaging.Mr. Cohen said the president had firsthand knowledge of the payment made to Ms. Daniels, just before Election Day in 2016, that were part of an effort to silence her from talking about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. Acting at the president’s direction, he said he procured a home-equity loan to pay Ms. Daniels $130,000. But Mr. Cohen also gave the committee documentary evidence: a copy of a check dated Aug. 1, 2017, for $35,000 from Mr. Trump’s personal bank account that bore Mr. Trump’s signature. Mr. Cohen said the check was one of 11 installments that the president made to reimburse him. Perhaps more important, Mr. Cohen said that the president directed him to lie about Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the payment to Ms. Daniels.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: The Testimony of Michael CohenIn an extraordinary public hearing, Donald Trump’s former fixer — once known for being unflinchingly loyal — became the star witness against him.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/30:33-30:33transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: The Testimony of Michael CohenHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester, Alexandra Leigh Young and Theo Balcomb, and edited by Lisa TobinIn an extraordinary public hearing, Donald Trump’s former fixer — once known for being unflinchingly loyal — became the star witness against him.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Michael Cohen is headed to prison for lying on behalf of Donald Trump. Yesterday, he told Congress he’s done protecting the president. It’s Thursday, February 28. Maggie Haberman, how does this hearing actually begin on Wednesday morning?maggie habermanThe hearing began in very dramatic fashion with Elijah Cummings, who chairs the committee, a Democrat, holding the gavel. Michael Cohen walking in through this crush of photographers and reporters, trailed by Lanny Davis, his attorney and sometimes spokesman, trailed by another of his attorneys, not by any member of his family, who I believe he was worried about attending this hearing. He sat down. His face was wan. His eyes were puffy. He looked exhausted, and defeated, and beaten down. And you could hear a pin drop as he sat down.archived recording (elijah cummings)The committee will come to order.maggie habermanSo Cummings out of the gate —archived recording (elijah cummings)I now recognize myself for five minutes to give an opening statement.maggie haberman— addressed the issue of Michael Cohen’s credibility.archived recording (elijah cummings)He admitted to lying about his actions to protect the president. Some will certainly ask, if Mr. Cohen was lying then, why should we believe him now?archived recordingGood question.archived recording (elijah cummings)This is a legitimate question.maggie habermanIt was very clear that Republicans were going to go right at Cohen, accusing him of being a liar, somebody who has admitted to lying, including admitting to lying to Congress when he gave testimony before them in 2017. So Cummings was hoping to put that to bed at the outset.archived recording (elijah cummings)This is an important factor we need to weigh. But we must weigh it, and we must hear from him.michael barbaroAnd Maggie, I found it fascinating what Cummings did at the close of this opening statement. He delivers this message straight to Cohen.archived recording (elijah cummings)Martin Luther King, Mr. Cohen, said some words that I leave with you today before you testify. He said, faith is taking the first step, even when you can’t see the whole staircase. There comes a time when silence becomes betrayal. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that truly matter. In the end, he says, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.maggie habermanAnd with that quote, he’s trying to set up Michael Cohen’s testimony — why he’s being truthful, that what he said before is a lie, and what he is saying now is the truth. And this was important for him to set this out as a way forward as the hearing began.archived recording (elijah cummings)Raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative. And thank you, and you may be seated.maggie habermanSo then Michael Cohen begins his opening statement. And it was long.archived recording (michael cohen)I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.maggie habermanAnd he began again by apologizing for lying to Congress.archived recording (michael cohen)I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the committee’s questions truthfully and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.maggie habermanAnd then he turned to Donald Trump.archived recording (michael cohen)I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is.maggie habermanAnd he depicted Donald Trump as a unsavory, unethical, immoral character.archived recording (michael cohen)Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries [expletive]. In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I can name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a [expletive]. This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States. And while we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.maggie habermanSomebody who told him from the Oval Office, in an Oval Office meeting, that he would be sending him a reimbursement for hush money payments.archived recording (michael cohen)Trump is a con man. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about it to his wife, which I did. And lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets.maggie habermanHe portrayed Donald Trump as a cheat.archived recording (michael cohen)And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom are small businesses, that were owed money for their services, and told them that no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I told Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.maggie habermanAs a schemer, who would inflate his net worth or devalue it, depending on what was useful for him at various points.archived recording (michael cohen)It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.maggie habermanAt one point, Michael Cohen told a very detailed story of Donald Trump’s relationship to the Vietnam War. Remember that Donald Trump has said that he had a deferment from the draft because he had, quote, unquote, bone spurs.archived recording (michael cohen)But when I asked for medical records, he gave me none, and said that there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters, but rather, offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment: “Do you think I’m stupid? I’m not going to Vietnam.”maggie habermanAnd at that moment, Michael Cohen looked directly into the camera.archived recording (michael cohen)And I find it ironic, Mr. President, that you are in Vietnam right now.michael barbaroRight.maggie habermanIt was damning stuff.archived recording (michael cohen)A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked documents, the Democratic National Committee emails, ahead of time. And the answer is yes. In July of 2016, days before the Democratic Convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange, and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect, wouldn’t that be great.michael barbaroAnd then he brings up, of course, the now-infamous Moscow project.maggie habermanRight.archived recording (michael cohen)I lied to Congress when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January of 2016. That was false. Our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.maggie habermanHe says that there were, you know, a handful of these conversations that went on into 2016, when it was clear that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican nominee.archived recording (michael cohen)Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me, “There’s no Russian business,” and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. So to be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.michael barbaroCohen’s almost describing, in this moment, a code, where, if Trump is saying to him, there is no Russia project, it’s almost like saying, there’s no Russia project, right? You’re never going to say there’s a Russia project. It’s like he’s trying to explain a foreign language in which Donald Trump is communicating to him, you should probably lie about this, without having to say it.maggie habermanThat’s exactly right. And he said that in his testimony, made very clear that this is how Donald Trump talks. He sort of knows where the line is, and he doesn’t speak overtly. It is what former federal prosecutors have described as mob speak, the style that mafia bosses speak in to avoid crossing a legal line. And while Michael Cohen did not explicitly say that part, he did say that Donald Trump spoke in a code and that Michael Cohen understood that code.archived recording (michael cohen)He doesn’t give you questions. He doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I’ve been around him for a decade.michael barbaroMaggie, did it come as a surprise to you to hear Michael Cohen saying any of this? You’ve known both of these men for years. And you’ve known them as a unit. What was it like to hear Cohen saying these things about Donald Trump?maggie habermanEven knowing that this was coming, it was mind-blowing hearing Michael Cohen saying this in public. No one who has worked for Trump in recent years has gone on the record to say things like this. And it was staggering. And it was so at odds with the portrait of fealty that Michael Cohen had presented with reporters, with everyone, toward Donald Trump over a decade.michael barbaroMm-hmm.maggie habermanAnd remember, Donald Trump creates an eagerness in people around him to get something of a head pat from him, to get an encouragement, to get an attaboy. Cohen got very skilled at trying for that attaboy.michael barbaroAnd seemed to be kind of addicted to it.maggie habermanAnd seemed to be addicted to it, seemed to revel in it, clearly reveled in his proximity.archived recording (michael cohen)Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul-searching. And I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions, in part, that I made.maggie habermanHe was involved in taking care of messes that Donald Trump wanted taken care of. He was willing to do those things. One of them was payoffs to women. And the notion that somebody who was so closely involved in that would be willing to discuss it publicly, not just behind closed doors with investigators, not just as prosecutors were bearing down on him, but freely, in public, in a hearing, under oath, was just breathtaking.michael barbaroThere’s a moment where Cohen says to the members of the committee —archived recording (michael cohen)The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today —michael barbaroToday, I’m here to tell you the truth —archived recording (michael cohen)I am here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.michael barbaro— about Mr. Trump. As if to say, the spell has been broken. I’m out of that world now. And I kind of wonder if that’s really possible, but also how it happened.maggie habermanWell, I think it is really possible, because I think their break has been so incredibly clean, given what has happened to Michael Cohen. Remember, when the F.B.I. raided his hotel and apartment and office in April of 2018, he was still standing by Trump. That clearly has changed. We saw Republicans argue that the reason that changed for Michael Cohen was because he was facing charges of his own. And the president has certainly suggested that. Cohen has been utterly stripped of everything that he valued, his business, his law license. He has been humiliated publicly. He has been abandoned by a lot of friends, and by the president, and by the president’s circle. And so I do think that it is certainly a real split. I think that people are going to have to assess, looking at his testimony, whether they think it’s a real conversion, but it’s definitely a real break.archived recording (michael cohen)I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of. And I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example that I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. And I thank you for your attention. And I’m happy to answer the committee’s questions.archived recording (elijah cummings)Thank you very much, Mr. Cohen. I now recognize myself.michael barbaroSo then the questions begin from the committee members.maggie habermanRight.archived recording (elijah cummings)You said you brought some checks, is that right?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, sir.maggie habermanAnd first we have Cummings asking Cohen to elaborate on the details of these reimbursement checks that he got, that he brought with him.archived recording (elijah cummings)So let me make sure I understand. Donald Trump wrote you a check out of his personal account while he was serving as president of the United States of America to reimburse you for hush money payments to Ms. Clifford, is that what you are telling the American people today?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, Mr. Chairman.maggie habermanAnd it was among the more dramatic moments that we saw. Because Cummings is getting to the fact that the sitting president was part of this scheme that was, at minimum, sleazy and illicit, and at maximum could have some criminal exposure. And they were leaving nothing to doubt as to what Cohen was saying took place.archived recording (elijah cummings)Is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for?archived recording (michael cohen)There is no doubt in my mind. And I truly believe there is no doubt in the minds of the people of the United States of America.archived recording (elijah cummings)With that I’ll yield to —maggie habermanJim Jordan, another ally of the president, quoted something that Michael Cohen once said to a reporter from The Daily Beast.archived recording (jim jordan)“I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse and I will take you for every penny you still don’t have.”maggie habermanAnd this has now become a famous anecdote, where he threatened a reporter who was pursuing a story about an old court claim from the divorce filing between Ivana Trump and Donald Trump, where she had alleged marital rape. And Cohen said —archived recording (jim jordan)“And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I’m warning you — ”maggie haberman“So I’m warning you, tread very f-ing lightly” — it wasn’t f-ing.archived recording (jim jordan)“Because what I’m going to do to you is going to be f-ing disgusting, you understand me?”maggie habermanAnd he was then asked by Jim Jordan, “Mr. Cohen, who said that?”archived recording (jim jordan)Mr. Cohen, who said that?archived recording (michael cohen)I did.maggie habermanAnd it’s an incident that I think he would say that he really was doing for Trump and not for himself. But it was a way to sully his character and create a portrait of thuggishness.archived recording (jim jordan)And did you say that, Mr. Cohen, was that statement that I just read that you admitted to saying, did you do that to protect Donald Trump?archived recording (michael cohen)I did it to protect Mr. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump.michael barbaroBut I wonder, who does it look worse for, the person who did it, or the person on whose behalf it was done?maggie habermanRight. I understand that Jim Jordan is trying to muddy Michael Cohen with that. But I think for most people, they are going to look at that, and especially after the president takes to Twitter and suggests that people ought to be looking into Michael Cohen’s family, I think most people are still going to see that as looking worse for Trump, because Michael Cohen was doing this as Trump’s lawyer.michael barbaroSo while Republicans are largely avoiding talking about the president at all costs in this hearing, in focusing on sullying Cohen’s character and reputation, they may be actually sullying President Trump’s.maggie habermanCorrect. They were essentially trying to peel Cohen off from Trump. And what became clear as their efforts went on throughout the hearing is that that is impossible to do. When you have had somebody serve as a lawyer for Donald Trump, so identified with him publicly over 10 years, you can’t take a shot at Cohen and not end up having it ricochet onto Trump too.archived recordingSo we’ve established that you lie on your taxes, you lie to banks, and you have been convicted of lying to Congress. It seems to me that there’s not much that you won’t lie about when you stand to gain from it.michael barbaroAnd where do the questions go from here?maggie habermanSo —archived recordingEverything’s been made of your lies in the past. I’m concerned about your lies today.maggie habermanAfter that it became a, you know —archived recordingBut there’s no truth with you whatsoever.maggie haberman— one by one, down the line, Republicans suggesting that Michael Cohen was —archived recordingLiar, liar, pants on fire.maggie habermanReally in it for the fame.archived recordingIs your appearance here today motivated by your desire to remain in the spotlight for your personal benefit?archived recording (michael cohen)No, ma’am.maggie habermanOr he was really in it for the money. They asked him —archived recordingIs there a book deal coming or anything like that?archived recording (michael cohen)I have no book deal right now.maggie habermanOne after the other about prospective book deals or movie deals.archived recordingIsn’t it true you tried to sell a book about your time with President Trump, entitled “Trump Revolution: From the Tower to the White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump“?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, that happened —maggie habermanOr had he pitched a book of his own?michael barbaroAnd what did he say?maggie habermanHe said yes.archived recording (michael cohen)I have been contacted by many, including for television, a movie. If you want to tell me who you would like to play you, I’m more than happy to write the name down.michael barbaroAnd what about the Democrats?archived recording (elijah cummings)Mr. Raskin.archived recording (jamie raskin)Mr. Cohen, thank you for your composure today. Our colleagues are not upset because you lied to Congress for the president. They’re upset because you’ve stopped lying to Congress for the president.maggie habermanThe Democrats tried to keep it really mostly on Trump and the things that Michael Cohen did for Trump.archived recordingAnd nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through President Donald Trump, correct?archived recording (michael cohen)That’s 100 percent certain.archived recordingO.K.maggie habermanHe described, and it was really interesting, he described everybody as being solely devoted to protecting the brand and reputation of one man, Donald Trump. He said that nothing happened at the company unless Donald Trump was aware of it or signed off on it. He argued that Trump was a demanding and exacting and punishing boss. He described the entire effort as being about maximizing the gold-plated version of Donald Trump that we have all become very familiar with.archived recordingThere’s a recurring refrain in your testimony that says, and yet, I continued to work for him. But at some point you changed. What was the breaking point at which you decided to start telling the truth?archived recording (michael cohen)There are several factors — Helsinki, Charlottesville.maggie habermanHe went on this litany of moments that he said disgusted him. There were the president’s comments after Charlottesville, that it was, you know, various instance of discourteous behavior by the president, of untoward behavior toward citizens.archived recording (michael cohen)Watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up silly things like this.archived recordingOh, that’s silly.archived recording (michael cohen)Really unbecoming of Congress.maggie habermanHe clearly got angry. And then he sort of turned it back on Republicans and said to them, essentially —archived recording (michael cohen)It’s that sort of behavior that I’m responsible for. I’m responsible for your silliness. Because I did the same thing that you’re doing now, for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.maggie habermanYou are what I was. You are all blindly following him. And there is a real risk to doing that, because you could end up like me someday.archived recording (michael cohen)And I can only warn people, the more people that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.maggie habermanIt was a gripping and captivating moment.michael barbaroRight, it was a sort of surprising level of self-awareness, and I guess also self-loathing too.maggie habermanIt was both. It was self-effacing. It was clearly uncomfortable. It was acknowledging that he is a deeply imperfect person who did imperfect things that he is not proud of, and he said a version of that earlier in the hearing. But it was really striking, because this is a comment that Republicans who opposed Donald Trump, and they’re not very many of them who are that vocal anymore, but that they have said repeatedly that the Republican Party has become a cult of personality, or just a cult. And that people just blindly follow along with what Donald Trump wants, whether it is wise or not, whether it is safe or not, and whether he is telling the truth or not. And that is what Cohen was getting at.archived recordingWhat do you want your children to know?archived recording (michael cohen)That I’m sorry for everything. And I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve caused them. And um — I wish I could go back in time.archived recordingThank you, I yield back.archived recording (elijah cummings)The gentlelady’s time has expired.michael barbaroMaggie, I wonder if you feel like you understand what’s motivating Michael Cohen throughout this hours-long hearing, to say what he’s saying, to concede what he’s conceding, to kind of humble himself the way he did. He’s been convicted of a crime. He’s headed to prison. He has been disbarred. What exactly is animating him at this point?maggie habermanI think a number of things are animating him. But I think among them is that he doesn’t want to be the leper of this story forever. He said months ago that he does not want to be the villain in the Trump story. And I think that’s how he feels. I think that he does not want to be remembered as this footnote in history. I think he’s going to prison. And I think he doesn’t have a whole lot left to lose. And I think that he would like to try to make people remember other things about him and tell a more nuanced tale.michael barbaroAnd so, what did this hearing, in your mind, achieve? How will this hearing be remembered in this larger story?maggie habermanI think this hearing is either going to be, on its own, just a breathtaking historical moment, the likes of which I don’t know if we’ll ever see again. But it was pretty striking to see. Or it is going to be the initial phases of a much broader, deeper governmental investigation by House Democrats into the Trump presidency, not just his own personal activities, but the activities of his government. And allowing Michael Cohen to have a setting where he talks about these things, and where he can be questioned, and where he is a key starting witness could be the first step in paving the way toward an impeachment process, if that is where Democrats go. If that ends up leading to something bigger, then Democrats will feel as if this was a key foundation for it. But it’s too early to say, I think.archived recording (michael cohen)I have some closing remarks I would like to say myself. Is this an appropriate time?archived recording (elijah cummings)You can do it now.archived recording (michael cohen)Thank you.michael barbaroMaggie, how does this one of hearing finally come to an end?maggie habermanSeven and a half hours after Michael Cohen first entered this room, sitting pretty patiently through all of these questions, not losing his temper, he was given an opportunity to speak not just to the committee members, but to the president.archived recording (michael cohen)In closing, I’d like to say directly to the president, we honor our veterans, even in the rain. You tell the truth, even when it doesn’t aggrandize you.maggie habermanAnd he used that opportunity to send a message to his former boss, saying, you don’t need to be this person.archived recording (michael cohen)You take responsibility for your own dirty deeds. You don’t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you. You don’t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don’t vilify people based on the God they pray to. And you don’t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies.maggie habermanAnd what he was saying to the president, you and I both know who you are, and he was saying to the members of the committee, you should believe me when I say that I understand this man.archived recording (michael cohen)So to those who support the president and his rhetoric, as I once did, I pray the country doesn’t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying. And I thank you very much for this additional time, Chairman.archived recording (elijah cummings)Thank you very much.maggie habermanAnd when Michael Cohen was done, Elijah Cummings closed with this note of grace toward Michael Cohen.archived recording (elijah cummings)So you wonder whether people believe you. I don’t know. I don’t know whether they believe you. But the fact is that you’ve come, you have your head down. And this has got to be one of the hardest things that you could do.maggie habermanThat was the moment when Michael Cohen started crying. And he really hadn’t done that. He was clearly weeping.archived recording (elijah cummings)I know that you face a lot. I know that you are worried about your family. But this is a part of your destiny.maggie habermanAnd Cummings basically told Cohen, you are doing what you should be doing. You are heading toward the light in this moment.archived recording (elijah cummings)And hopefully, this portion of your destiny will lead to a better — a better Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America and a better world.michael barbaroMaggie, thank you very, very much. We appreciate it.maggie habermanMichael, thanks for having me.archived recording (elijah cummings)And we have got to get back to normal. With that, this meeting is adjourned. [MUSIC PLAYING]michael barbaroWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, Pakistan said it had shot down two Indian fighter jets and captured a pilot from one of them in the latest escalation of hostilities between the two countries. The attack is heightening fears that the decades-old animosities between India and Pakistan could spiral into war. The latest episode began on February 14th, when jihadis operating out of Pakistan killed 40 Indian soldiers, prompting airstrikes from India, and now, a military response from Pakistan.archived recording[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Bomb blast victims in [INAUDIBLE].michael barbaroIn a speech on Wednesday, the prime minister of Pakistan urged restraint, citing the two countries’ arsenals of nuclear weapons, saying quote, “All big wars have been due to miscalculation. My question to India is that given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?”archived recording[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]michael barbaroAnd in North Carolina on Wednesday, a campaign operative at the center of allegations of election fraud, McCrae Dallas, was arrested and indicted over his handling of absentee ballots in 2016 and 2018. Dallas, who collected absentee ballots for Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris last fall, was charged with obstruction of justice and possession of absentee ballots. As a result of Dallas’ conduct, North Carolina will hold a new election for the 9th congressional district. Harris, who hired Dallas, has withdrawn from that race. [MUSIC PLAYING] That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.Possible conspiracy with Russians remains on the table.Mr. Cohen testified that Mr. Trump, on at least a half-dozen occasions in 2016, asked questions about negotiations over building a Trump Tower in Moscow. “Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,” Mr. Cohen said in his opening statement.But Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump did not explicitly instruct him to lie about the matter. Rather, as one who worked for Mr. Trump for nearly a decade, Mr. Cohen said he understood the president’s directions without specific words, saying Mr. Trump spoke in “code,” and he understood “the code.” He added that the president’s lawyers reviewed Mr. Cohen’s false statements to Congress about the Moscow project.Mr. Cohen offered just enough strands of information, though, to keep the Russia issue very much alive, and to invite additional scrutiny from congressional Democrats, possibly even involving the president’s children. “To be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations through the campaign and lied about it,” Mr. Cohen said.He cited a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower in Manhattan with Russians who claimed to have “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. At the meeting, he said, were Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law; and Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman. Mr. Cohen also suggested that Mr. Trump knew about the meeting, something that the president has denied.He added that Mr. Trump knew in advance that WikiLeaks was going to divulge thousands of emails stolen from Democrats. He said that Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, told Mr. Trump that he had talked with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who said there would be a “massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”According to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump responded, “Wouldn’t that be great.”Mr. Cohen explains the role of “a fixer.”The term “fixer” evokes movies or novels about organized crime, men in dark coats and heavy beards who make problems go away. Mr. Cohen provided a nonfiction account of that role, which he played for Mr. Trump, a man for whom Mr. Cohen once said he would take a bullet.Mr. Cohen explained to members of Congress the concept of “catch and kill,” a method of stopping a negative article before it is published, in this case by working with the company that owns The National Enquirer. Other duties, he said, included writing threatening letters to schools, warning them against the release of Mr. Trump’s academic records, and paying off a woman with compromising information about a presidential candidate.“That was my job,” Mr. Cohen said. “Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life.”How Trump Fits Into, and Denies, Cohen’s NarrativeWednesday’s congressional hearing is focusing in part on how much Trump knew about hush money payments and a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.Cohen savaged Trump’s character.Not content to talk only about a possible conspiracy and payoffs to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Cohen also offered a damnable assessment of Mr. Trump’s character. He said that he made bigoted remarks about African-Americans in the United States and about predominantly black nations.He said Mr. Trump boasted about inflating assets when it served him, and about understating values when it helped to lower his taxes. He also carried out orders from Mr. Trump to tell contractors that Mr. Trump was refusing to pay them the money owed “for their services.”About avoiding Vietnam through a medical deferment, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump told him, “You think I’m stupid? I wasn’t going to Vietnam.”Mr. Cohen did offer one important piece of exculpatory information for the president. He said that despite many rumors, he knew of no tape from an elevator that showed Mr. Trump hitting his wife, Melania.A retreat to tribal corners.Mr. Cohen’s testimony will reinforce the partisan divide over the president. Whether it will be regarded as seminal in the investigation is an open question.The performance of the members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, is unlikely to leave a mark. Mr. Cohen tried to warn Republicans that they, today, were just like he once was: a supplicant to Mr. Trump. They responded by questioning why they should listen to a man convicted of lying.The questions fell along party lines. Few members seemed to have done deep research to elicit new information, and the polarization of the era was on vivid display.Michael Tackett covers national politics. He has written about politics for more than 30 years and has covered six presidential elections.

ShearFeb. 27, 2019Leer en españolWASHINGTON — The dramatic public testimony to Congress on Wednesday morning by President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, could intensify the legal issues facing the president in the criminal and civil investigations that are swirling around him, legal experts said.Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee was a remarkable personal and political rebuke to the president from a lawyer who served Mr. Trump with fierce loyalty for more than a decade.In his prepared testimony and about five hours of grilling by lawmakers, Mr. Cohen — who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and will go to prison for his crimes — blasted the president as a “racist,” a “con man” and a “cheat.”But legal experts said several of the specific allegations by Mr. Cohen in his opening statement could be relevant to questions about whether Mr. Trump participated in a conspiracy to affect the 2016 election, violated campaign finance laws and obstructed justice in an effort to deflect investigations.The experts cautioned that nothing Mr. Cohen said drastically altered what was known about any legal case against the president. The relevant laws are complex, and the president’s lawyers have repeatedly argued that he did not violate them. And perhaps most important, they note, there is a Justice Department policy that asserts that a president may not be indicted while in office.Still, Mr. Cohen’s testimony surfaced some new information that could be relevant to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, or other prosecutors investigating cases touching on the president. Here are some examples:Hush Money for Porn StarIn his prepared remarks, Mr. Cohen described in detail how Mr. Trump personally reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, to ensure her silence about an affair with Mr. Trump.“In February 2017, one month into his presidency, I’m visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time,” Mr. Cohen said. “It’s truly awe-inspiring, he’s showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect of ‘Don’t worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were FedExed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system.’”Richard L. Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, said prosecutors could use Mr. Cohen’s description of the payments from Mr. Trump to bolster a charge of campaign finance violations.Michael D. Cohen’s Congressional TestimonyMichael D. Cohen, the former lawyer and fixer for President Donald J. Trump, took the stand on Wednesday morning to testify publicly against Mr. Trump before the House Oversight Committee.“To the extent that these were illegal campaign finance contributions, which were reimbursed and not reported, here is more evidence that Trump was conspiring to violate campaign finance laws as president,” Mr. Hasen said.He noted, however, that campaign finance laws — which are complex — require proof that a person was willfully violating them. Mr. Cohen’s testimony does not prove that Mr. Trump knew that the payments he was making were illegal — something that prosecutors would have to prove if they wanted to charge the president.WikiLeaks and EmailsIn his testimony, Mr. Cohen described a moment when he said Roger J. Stone Jr., one of Mr. Trump’s top political operatives, called the president to tell him about a conversation with Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.“I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,” Mr. Cohen said. “Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”Mr. Cohen added: “Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‘wouldn’t that be great.’”Legal experts cautioned that just proving that Mr. Trump knew about the WikiLeaks plans to leak damaging documents ahead of time would not necessarily prove that the president or his campaign were guilty of conspiracy. Prosecutors would have to prove that Mr. Trump and the campaign actively engaged in coordinating with Russians to distribute the documents or took other actions to affect the outcome of the election.The question of contacts between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign is central to the issue of whether there was any conspiracy between the campaign and Russia. It is not known what Mr. Trump might have told Mr. Mueller’s team about what, if anything, he knew about WikiLeaks’ plans or about contacts between Mr. Stone and Mr. Assange.Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor, said that if Mr. Cohen is telling the truth, and if Mr. Trump claimed to Mr. Mueller in his sworn, written testimony that he was not aware of any contacts between Mr. Stone and Mr. Assange, that could be a crime.“When you lie in that context, it’s not only perjury but it’s obstruction of justice, too,” Mr. Zeidenberg said.VideoPresident Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen has been sentenced to prison for offenses, including paying women for their silence during the 2016 election. Here’s a look at how this could affect the president.CreditCreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesCampaign Finance ViolationsMr. Cohen’s testimony about Mr. Stone’s conversation with Mr. Trump could also open the president up to further campaign finance violations, Mr. Hasen said.Federal law bars campaigns from taking anything of value from foreign entities. The conversation with Mr. Stone could be used to help prove that Mr. Trump and his campaign knowingly accepted valuable help from WikiLeaks in his efforts to defeat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.“If it’s true that Stone was directly in communication with Assange while also communicating with Trump and the Trump campaign, there’s the potential for a violation of the campaign finance laws involving foreign contributions,” Mr. Hasen said.He was quick to point out that prosecutors would need to have more evidence than just the conversation between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. “There are a lot more steps that we would need to conclude that Trump or the Trump campaign acted illegally with regard to WikiLeaks,” he said.Trump Tower MoscowIn his prepared remarks, Mr. Cohen disputed a report this year from BuzzFeed News that Mr. Trump “personally instructed him to lie” to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow — an allegation that could lead to criminal charges if true.“Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress,” Mr. Cohen said. “That’s not how he operates.”But Mr. Cohen added that the president implicitly instructed him to lie about the Moscow deal by repeatedly lying about it himself.“In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,” Mr. Cohen said. “In his way, he was telling me to lie.”ImageRoger Stone leaving court last week in Washington. CreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesMr. Cohen also said later during the hearing that Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, reviewed the false testimony that Mr. Cohen had prepared to give to Congress in May 2017 related to the Trump Tower Moscow project. Mr. Cohen suggested that Mr. Sekulow made changes that related to the timing of the project.“There were several changes made, including how we were going to handle that message which was — the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive,” Mr. Cohen said Wednesday.Legal experts said the law did not require prosecutors to prove that Mr. Trump explicitly told Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress. But they also said that any effort to obscure the timing of the negotiations over the construction project could be used as evidence of motive in efforts to build a conspiracy case against the president.“If you’re going to make a case of conspiracy with the Russians, that’s going to be front and center,” Mr. Zeidenberg said.Trump Tower MeetingMr. Cohen testified that he overheard a conversation that he believed proved that Mr. Trump knew about a campaign meeting between his top campaign aides and people connected with Russians.“I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: ‘The meeting is all set.’ And I remember Mr. Trump saying: ‘O.K. good. Let me know,’” Mr. Cohen said.The president’s knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting has been at the center of questions about whether his campaign conspired with Russians to affect the outcome of the presidential election. Legal experts said Mr. Cohen’s testimony could be relevant to any case that might be built against the president by Mr. Mueller.Violations by Trump CharityIn his remarks, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to use Trump Foundation funds to acquire a portrait of Mr. Trump.ImageDonald Trump Jr. at a rally in El Paso, Tex., this month.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times“The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000,” Mr. Cohen said. “Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself.”Legal experts said that could be a civil violation of state laws governing charitable foundations. Mr. Trump’s foundation has been under investigation for its operations, including similar purchases of another portrait.In December, the foundation announced it would shut down after the New York attorney general accused it of “functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump’s business and political interests.”Inflating Net WorthAmong the allegations Mr. Cohen made during his testimony was that Mr. Trump had tried to inflate his own net worth to Deutsche Bank when he approached the bank about lending him money to buy the Buffalo Bills.To back up his claim, Mr. Cohen provided the committee financial documents that listed Mr. Trump’s personal assets and liabilities in 2011, 2012 and 2013.Providing false information to a bank to get a loan can lead to charges of bank fraud or conspiracy, according to legal experts. But the process of determining the value of property is also highly subjective, which could limit the president’s legal exposure.Other Legal UnknownsIn hours of testimony, Mr. Cohen mostly touched on legal questions that have already been in public view. But legal experts said it was important to remember how much legal work had been kept secret by the prosecutors running the various investigations.That reality was underscored when Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, asked Mr. Cohen whether there was “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven’t yet discussed today.”Mr. Cohen’s answer was tantalizing: “Yes, and again those are part of the investigation that’s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York.”He did not elaborate.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Star Witness Testimony That Could Complicate Legal Issues for Trump.

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________The special counsel is wrapping things up.On Tuesday, The Times published an examination of President Trump’s actions that found the president had actively tried to undermine multiple investigations surrounding his administration. His efforts have exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, wraps up his probe.In the coming weeks, Mr. Mueller is expected to deliver his final account of a nearly two-year investigation into Russia’s election interference to William Barr, the new attorney general. Mr. Barr will then have to decide how much of the report to make public.The rules governing the special counsel give Mr. Barr considerable flexibility in deciding how much information from the report he provides to Congress and the public. Democratic lawmakers want to ensure that every detail is shared.Additional Reading• Takeaways From The Times’s Investigation Into Trump’s War on the Inquiries Around Him• Graham Vows to Investigate Whether ‘Bureaucratic Coup’ Tried to Oust Trump• I.R.S.

The move left Senate Republicans sharply divided, and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop it.Speaker Nancy Pelosi began her push to overturn the emergency declaration on Friday, scheduling a House vote for Tuesday — a remarkably short timeline — on legislation that would end it.But Mr. Trump’s plan to build his border wall involves more than his invocation of emergency powers to redirect military construction funds. He plans to tap into $2.5 billion in other Pentagon funds, too.Additional Reading• Trump Claims His Wall Is Being Built.

In just over 24 hours, he raised $6 million from more than 225,000 donors, showing that he still has strong support.Health care is becoming the first real issue of the primary race. On one side, Mr. Sanders promises a single-payer revolution. On the other, candidates like Senators Amy Klobuchar and Sherrod Brown are calling for incremental change.In recent weeks, some Democratic candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have embraced race-conscious proposals that even the most left-wing elected officials once shied away from — like reparations for slavery.Additional Reading• Bernie Sanders Stumbled With Black Voters in 2016.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Trump Is EpicAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe conversationTrump Is EpicOn that we can all agree. On 2020, not so much.By Gail Collins and Bret StephensMs. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.Feb. 26, 2019Image"Which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you?" Gail Collins asks.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBret Stephens: Gail, the word is that Robert Mueller may soon send his report to Attorney General William Barr. Do you expect a bombshell, a dud — or just a lot more confusion, depending on what Barr makes public and what Congress chooses to do with its conclusions?Gail Collins: Well, we’ve already got indicted minions. As to Trump himself, I feel very safe voting for “a lot more confusion.” Just on general principles. The Trump presidential campaign was knee-deep in conflicts of interest, many of them involving Russia. But given the man’s general disorganization, I find it hard to imagine the report picking him out as the sinister, canny leader who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes.Still feeling that the real disaster for Trump is going to come with the investigations into his business practices in New York. How about you?Bret: That’s my guess, too. Trump’s $100 million inauguration committee looks like a giant pay-to-play scheme. I still think his alleged campaign-finance violations in connection to the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal payoffs are criminal and impeachable. And who knows what else Mueller’s investigation have dredged up about Trump family values.Gail: The family that stays together preys together …Bret: And vice versa. That said, if Mueller finds no clear and credible evidence of collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be a major political victory for the president and a liability for his detractors. Fairly or not, it will call all the other investigations into question, however credible or serious they may be.That’s one of the reasons I’ve been leery of investing too much political capital in wondering what Trump might have done behind people’s backs. It’s what he does every day in plain sight that is much more concerning.Gail: Even if the Mueller investigation fails to produce, we’ll still have a bunch of congressional committees digging up dirt. But I know that’s not as satisfying for a conservative Trump-hater. You’re right that there’s plenty to investigate in his normal day-to-day life. Which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you?Bret: Well, that list is long. But let me start by praising Trump on a couple of fronts. I think he’s shown moral leadership on Venezuela, by getting much of the world to recognize Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president and drawing attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding under the Maduro regime. And I’m also glad he’s partially reversed course and will keep at least some troops in Syria. I hope he winds up withdrawing none of them so long as they can help protect our Kurdish friends and deter our Syrian, Iranian, Russian and Turkish foes.O.K. Now to the rest. His declaration of a national emergency over border-wall funding is a threat to constitutional government and the separation of powers and sets a precedent that both sides will abuse if the Supreme Court doesn’t stop it.Gail: No disagreement on the national emergency. The fact that you haven’t seen a major uprising of Republicans over that is proof that there’s no real Republican Party anymore, only Trumpism.And I’m looking forward to the next Democratic president declaring that climate change is a national emergency …Bret: His unloading on The New York Times as “a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” is an assault on the First Amendment and the safety of journalists, including us. His hankering for a deal — any deal — with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un so that he can win a Nobel Peace Prize is a danger to peace and stability in Asia.Gail: Our publisher really called Trump out on the danger he is creating for journalists. It’s perilous enough reporting from trouble spots around the globe without having the president of the United States cheerleading for the enemies of a free press.Bret: His desire to start another trade war with Europe, this time over cars, is a threat to global growth and another nail in the coffin of trans-Atlantic unity. His nonstop lies and exaggerations and demagoguery about the purported evils of illegal immigration are an insult to our intelligence and devastating to the G.O.P.’s chances of ever again being a majority party.Gail: I love it when you get on a roll like this. Keep going.Bret: And his overall comportment continues to be a foul stain on the office of the presidency, a moral embarrassment to a majority of Americans, and a blot on the record of liberal democracy. How about you?Gail: Well, you’ve kind of run the table. But I’d add his attempts to undermine women’s reproductive rights. The assault on Planned Parenthood isn’t just about abortion, it’s about the far right’s hatred of anything that gives women the power to decide if and when they want to get pregnant. Can’t tell you what a deep irony it is to have this guy leading that crusade.Bret: I’d call it hypocrisy, not irony, but I’m being pedantic.Gail: And everything about guns and domestic violence. Many people have taken note of the fact that the president tweeted out about the Smollett scandal and the suit against The Washington Post by the Kentucky high school student who was involved in that incident with a Native American in Washington. But not a twittery word about the white supremacist Coast Guard officer who has been accused of stockpiling weapons to murder newscasters and liberal politicians. When reporters asked him about it, all Trump could come up with was, “I think it’s a shame.” That’s the kind of thing you say when a politician gets caught cheating on his wife, not when you’re talking about a self-declared white supremacist intent on a politically inspired mass slaughter.Bret: The Smollett and Covington High stories are fascinating in a cultural sense, mostly for what they tell us about our current culture of victimhood and the assumptions too many people, including too many in our profession, make about who is the victim based on current stereotypes. But the case of the Coast Guard officer is genuinely terrifying given that it comes on the heels of the Florida mail bomber, the Pittsburgh mass killer and the California man charged last year with phoning in death threats to journalists. That’s a terrifying reality of the culture war from which most of the right prefers to look away.Gail: Not long before he announced that he was running for president, Trump went to an N.R.A. convention and got a wild, massive reception. Right then I knew he was going to be a huge gun-rights supporter, no matter what he had believed before.When he was running against Hillary Clinton I thought he was terrible, but not nearly as terrible as he turned out to be. Kind of amazing. Did you foresee all of this?Bret: Partly. I wrote more than a dozen columns for The Wall Street Journal during the last presidential campaign, denouncing his bigotry, lawlessness, ignorance and demagoguery. He vindicates my first impression with his every foul tweet. I think he’s debasing our political culture in ways we will be living with, and suffering from, for at least a generation. And he’s becoming a role model of sorts for other populist demagogues around the world, from Brazil to Italy.Gail: Well, I wrote a lot about what a jerk he’d been in New York for the last 30-odd years. I guess I didn’t take him seriously enough because he’d always behaved like such a fool.Bret: On the other hand, the world didn’t end with his presidency. The economy is robust, we haven’t stumbled into a catastrophic war (yet), and democracy is still alive and well considering all the Democrats planning to run against him. That isn’t to say things might not still go horribly wrong, only that the habit of comparing Trump to despots of yore is off the mark and undermines the case against him.Gail: Right. He’s our own special unique despot wannabe.Bret: But can I switch the subject? Last week The Times ran an eye-opening story on Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, basically to the effect that she is a truly horrible boss, with some of the highest staff turnover in the Senate. From a policy standpoint she’s my favorite Democrat in the race, but this is a serious issue for her candidacy. How do you think voters should factor that into their considerations?Gail: I’m playing the wait-and-see card. We’re undoubtedly going to find out unpleasant things about a lot of the candidates as we go along. But that story about her using her comb to eat a salad on an airplane and then giving it to her aide to wash is going to … resonate.Your position is that you’ll vote for whoever the Democrats nominate, even if it’s a modern-day Attila the Hun, right?Bret: Definitely not! Of course I can’t vote for Trump under any circumstance. But I would never vote for Bernie Sanders, who seems to think bread lines are a good thing because they’re egalitarian. I couldn’t vote for Elizabeth Warren, either; she’s too far to my left and her prevarications about her ancestry are morally insulting and intellectually embarrassing. I have personal reservations about Cory Booker, stemming from his deceits as mayor of Newark, and Kamala Harris, stemming from her behavior as a prosecutor. If any of them is the nominee, I will probably write in Bill Weld or John Kasich or Larry Hogan — middle-of-the-road Republicans or former Republicans who know how to win over Democrats and could govern from the center.Gail: Ah, I remember many Republicans who had those sentiments: Trump was appalling and impossible to support, but Hillary Clinton was too far a bridge to cross. And so they voted for people like Gary Johnson, the Libertarian. Which meant they helped put Trump in office.Bret: I voted for Hillary Clinton, even though I had plenty of reservations. But there’s no way I’m going to follow Democrats jumping off the cliff on the left because I’m angry at Republicans for jumping off the cliff on the right.Gail: Really, I have to warn you. If I hear any Trump-hater talking about writing in his mother’s name or the Green Party name or Howard Schultz I immediately decide this is a person who would rather have four more years of Donald Trump than compromise his principles by voting for a deeply imperfect Democrat.Bret: I’m already compromising many of my usual political principles by voting for centrist Democrats, never mind the real lefties. I could vote for Joe Biden, though I doubt he’ll get the nomination, or Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado (our boss’s brother), or any other middle-of-the-road Democrat. That category included Klobuchar, but I have a problem with people who are horrible bosses and don’t have the good sense to use their fingers to eat the way I do.But let’s talk about something our readers really care about: the Oscars. Did you watch? Did your favorites win?Gail: I believe this is the first year ever that I’ve seen all the movies nominated for best picture, and best actress and best actor — and pretty much everything. This is all about avoiding Donald Trump. Since he’s been president I’ve instinctively organized my life around trying to forget about current events for at least a few hours a day. It’s the same reason I’ve been watching football for the first time in my life.But about the winners — I like watching people be genuinely surprised, so I really enjoyed seeing Olivia Colman win for playing the dotty queen in “The Favourite.” How about you?Bret: I saw only a few of the films. But I was thrilled with the win for “Free Solo,” the documentary about climber Alex Honnold that I wrote a column about last year. And I was deeply moved by “Roma.” I grew up in Mexico City, and the movie perfectly captured a world I know very, very well. Nice to see that in this accelerated age of ours there’s still appreciation for a film that takes it slow and goes deep.Gail: And while we’re talking about awards that made me happy — congratulations on winning the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, Bret! I’m so glad your fight for immigrant rights is being recognized. You deserve it. And as a bonus, I can’t think of anything that would irritate Donald Trump more.Bret: Thanks, Gail. Of course I’ll be bringing my mom to the ceremony. This year will be her 69th as an immigrant in this country.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Republicans Sink Further Into Trump’s CesspoolAdvertisementOpinionSupported byRepublicans Sink Further Into Trump’s CesspoolWhat they left out of their questioning of Michael Cohen says more about the degradation of my former party than anything they said.By Peter WehnerContributing Opinion WriterFeb. 27, 2019ImageA check from President Trump to Michael Cohen on display at the House committee hearing at which Mr. Cohen was testifying on Wednesday.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesMichael Cohen’s testimony before Congress on Wednesday revealed as much about the Republican Party as it did about President Trump and his former lawyer. In the aftermath of Mr. Cohen’s damning testimony, several things stand out.The first is that unlike John Dean, the former White House counsel who delivered searing testimony against President Richard Nixon in 1973, Mr. Cohen produced documents of Mr. Trump’s ethical and criminal wrongdoing. (Mr. Dean had to wait for the Watergate tapes to prove that what he was saying was true.)Mr. Cohen’s most explosive evidence included a copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account, while he was president, to reimburse Mr. Cohen for hush money payments. The purpose of that hush money, of course, was to cover up Mr. Trump’s affair with a pornographic film star in order to prevent damage to his campaign.Other evidence produced by Mr. Cohen included financial statements, examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his wealth to serve his interests, examples of charity fraud, efforts to intimidate Mr. Cohen and his family and even letters sent by Mr. Cohen to academic institutions threatening legal actions if Mr. Trump’s grades and SAT scores were released. (Mr. Trump hammered President Barack Obama on this front, referring to him as a “terrible student, terrible,” and mocking him for not releasing his grades.)Yet Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, in their frantic effort to discredit Mr. Cohen, went after him while steadfastly ignoring the actual evidence he produced. They tried to impugn his character, but were unable to impugn the documents he provided. Nor did a single Republican offer a character defense of Mr. Trump. It turns out that was too much, even for them.In that sense, what Republicans didn’t say reveals the truth about what happened at the hearing on Wednesday as much as what they did say. Republicans showed no interest, for example, in pursuing fresh allegations made by Mr. Cohen that Mr. Trump knew
that WikiLeaks planned to release hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee in the summer of 2016.In a sane world, the fact that the president’s former lawyer produced evidence that the president knowingly and deceptively committed a federal crime — hush money payments that violated campaign finance laws — is something that even members of the president’s own party would find disquieting. But not today’s Republican Party.Instead, in the most transparent and ham-handed way, they saw no evil and heard no evil, unless it involved Mr. Cohen. Republicans on the committee tried to destroy the credibility of his testimony, not because they believe that his testimony is false, but because they fear it is true.By now Republicans must know, deep in their hearts, that Mr. Cohen’s portrayal of Mr. Trump as a “racist,” “a con man” and “a cheat” is spot on. So it is the truth they fear, and it is the truth — the fundamental reality of the world as it actually is — that they feel compelled to destroy. This is the central organizing principle of the Republican Party now. More than tax cuts. More than trade wars. More even than building a wall on our southern border. Republicans are dedicated to annihilating truth in order to defend Mr. Trump and they will go after anyone, from Mr. Cohen to Robert Mueller, who is a threat to him.He is their emperor, and they are his political Praetorian Guard.A second thing that stands out from Mr. Cohen’s testimony is that the Republican Party has been as corrupted by its association with Mr. Trump as Mr. Cohen was by his. As Mr. Cohen told Republican lawmakers, “I did the same thing that you’re doing now. For 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.” He then issued this warning to them: “The more people that follow Mr. Trump — as I did blindly — are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.” Mr. Cohen later explained the ethos of Trumpworld: “Everybody’s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump. Every day most of us knew we were coming and we were going to lie for him about something. That became the norm.”The ethic that became the norm at the Trump Organization —- defacing the truth and disfiguring reality in the service of Donald J. Trump — is the ethic that has become the norm of the Republican Party and the American right.This is what some of us who are conservatives and who have been lifelong Republicans have warned since Mr. Trump began his quest for the presidency — that his corruptions would eventually become theirs.It didn’t take long.The way these things happen is simple and insidious. In this case, because Mr. Trump was their party’s nominee, many Republicans felt duty bound to defend him, even though they would from time to time call him out for his worst offenses. They also held out the hope that Mr. Trump would grow in office and become more presidential.What happened is quite different: As Mr. Trump was elected and then inaugurated, Republicans became more and more reluctant to call him out and more and more vocal in defending him and attacking his critics; rather than weakening, their loyalty to him intensified. And the president, rather than becoming more responsible, has become less restrained, more volatile, more unhinged. The result is the ethical wreckage we saw on display Wednesday.Republicans should brace for even more damaging revelations. The evidence presented on Wednesday was harmful to the president, but Mr. Cohen quite likely revealed only a small fraction of what the Southern District of New York and the Mueller investigation have amassed. Mr. Cohen did suggest that federal prosecutors are investigating unspecified criminal allegations involving the president that have not been made public.When this story is finally told — when the sordid details are revealed, the dots finally connected — the Republican Party will be the political and institutional version of Mr. Cohen, who squandered his integrity in the service of a man of borderless corruption.Related More on the Michael Cohen hearingOpinion | Caroline Fredrickson: How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Won the Cohen HearingFeb. 28, 2019Opinion | Noah Bookbinder: What We Have Learned From Cohen So FarFeb. 27, 2019Opinion | Michelle Cottle: Michael Cohen Has a Lot of RegretsFeb. 27, 2019Opinion | Nicholas Kristof: ‘He Is a Racist, He Is a Con Man, and He Is a Cheat’Feb. 27, 2019Peter Wehner (@Peter Wehner), a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Cohen, former lawyer and fixer for President Trump, testified before the House Oversight Committee in Washington on Wednesday.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Lela MooreFeb. 28, 2019Michael D. Cohen brought receipts. The former lawyer and fixer for President Trump, while testifying before Congress on Wednesday, laid out the documents he said would corroborate his account of his work for the president. But with Mr. Cohen having pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, tax evasion and lying to Congress and having been sentenced to three years in federal prison, will the documents be enough to convince the public?In over 600 comments, Times readers told us how they saw Wednesday’s hearing and what they thought others should take away from it. Many expressed deep pessimism about the process and the outcome. “Will anything change?” was a refrain echoed by many, implicitly or explicitly.Here is a selection of comments that originally appeared on our coverage and have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. ‘He is a professional liar, and liars lie’What I find ironic is that many of the same people who claimed that Mr. Cohen was incapable of telling the truth when he worked for Mr. Trump now find him a shining beacon of truth when he is working against Mr. Trump. He is a professional liar, and liars lie. I did not believe him then, and I do not believe him now. His testimony, if not backed by documentation, is worthless and if backed by documentation, is redundant.— Michael Cody, Niagara Falls, N.Y. I fear that Michael Cohen’s testimony will play out the same way as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony did regarding Brett Kavanaugh: Cohen’s accusations will get widespread media attention; to those with an open mind he will seem highly credible; then the accused and his surrogates will viciously attack him; and the Republicans in Congress will dismiss the allegations and continue to do the president’s bidding. But members of the general public should ask themselves this: as with Dr. Ford, what motive does Michael Cohen have to lie at this point?— Dan Bernstein, Sacramento‘Your country should be proud that it is free enough to allow this’Although nothing Cohen says comes as a great surprise, it is rather soothing and hopeful that it is being put on record. Out loud by someone who knows. Under oath this is being said about the president of the United States of America. Your country should be proud that it is free enough to allow this, to be wise enough to spend time and energy on digging for the truth and to be democratic enough that these actions will have consequences. You are not turning a blind eye. As a European, I am witness to the fact that America will never let evil win. Not in the long run. I find that rather cool.— Saskia van der Tas, AmsterdamCohen’s testimony is useless. I read the document. Even if I believe everything he has to say, (I think there is no reason anymore to doubt him), I agree with the Republicans on this one. His lack of credibility, combined with the fact that all the evidence he has brought up is incidental, makes this process a farce. The Democrats fight Trump by lowering themselves to his level. But you can’t fight Trump with Trump. He is the master of this, you will always lose this way. You need to find HARD, irrefutable evidence. And I have to give Trump credit on this one. He knows how to not leave such evidence. He knows his craft well. — Christoph H., Vancouver‘Will anything change?’ Donald Trump once proclaimed that he could shoot somebody in broad daylight on Fifth Avenue and not lose any support. Since then, he has been given ample reason to believe he was right. His behavior and comportment as president have steadily deteriorated, his belief that he is bound by neither law nor constitution has been reinforced by his enablers in the Republican Party, and he has suffered not a single consequence for any of this.Now comes Michael Cohen, basically saying he was an eyewitness to the hypothetical “shooting” on Fifth Avenue. He has documents and firsthand experiences dealing with Trump, and he’s laying it all out on the table. Is this enough? Did he actually witness the “shooting,” or did he just hear the gun go off? Is he credible as Trump’s accuser when he admits that for 10 years he was his accomplice? We have developed a tolerance for Trump in the same way the Dread Pirate Roberts developed a tolerance for Iocane, a little bit at a time over a long period. If Michael Cohen’s opening statement is truly the beginning of his testimony, with more to come from Robert Mueller, then perhaps, at last, we’ll be able to regain our political health and sanity by not having to continue sipping the poison that is the Trump presidency.— Jim Castrone, Placitas, N.M.Will anything change? No past revelations about Mr. Trump have done anything to convince the Republican Party that they should distance themselves from this man. There have been no mass resignations from the administration. He himself has shown no remorse or shame.Mr. Trump will stay in office with the support of his party. They will support his re-election campaign. And he will continue to behave in the same manner.— M.H., MinneapolisThe purpose of these hearings isn’t to change minds or solidify opinions, but rather to have a small amount of transparency for the people in the U.S., as over the course of these investigations, there hasn’t been much whatsoever. This information needs to be heard so it doesn’t get swept under the rug. — Hannah Elise, Tennessee‘A cheap political trick’It is shameful that the Democrats would hold such a hearing while our president is overseas negotiating with North Korea, one of our most dangerous nuclear-armed adversaries. This hearing could have easily been held a week or two later. Instead, the Democrats have chosen a cheap political trick over national security and the security of your family and mine. The Democrats put us all at risk solely to try to gain a little partisan power and should be condemned for such an outrage. Shame, shame.— Steve W., Ford, Wash. Democrats are desperate to find a reason to continue their collusion narrative. They’ve had congressional hearings. No collusion found. They’ve had the Mueller investigation. No collusion found as yet. Perhaps a surprise is coming, but it’s doubtful. Now they’re scraping the bottom of the barrel to find something to keep their narrative alive. Cohen is a felon. They can elevate him but they cannot make him credible. — Andrea Economos, New YorkCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of one of our readers.

Lee/The New York TimesBy Benjamin WeiserFeb. 20, 2019[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Michael D. Cohen, the former lawyer and fixer for President Trump who was to report early next month to begin serving a three-year prison sentence, was granted a two-month delay on Wednesday before he must surrender to the authorities.Mr. Cohen, 52, must now report to a facility designated by the Bureau of Prisons on May 6, a federal judge in Manhattan, William H. Pauley III, said in a brief order.Mr. Cohen’s lawyers requested the delay, saying he recently had surgery and needed to undergo intensive physical therapy under the monitoring of his physician.They also said Mr. Cohen anticipated being called at the end of the month to testify before three congressional committees, which have sought to question him about his work for Mr. Trump. The “substantial time” he would need to prepare for the hearings, his lawyer, Michael D. Monico, wrote in a letter to the judge seeking the postponement, “will limit the time he has to get his affairs in order and spend time with his family.”Mr. Monico said on Wednesday that Mr. Cohen recently had shoulder surgery and that he and his legal team were “very happy” the judge had granted his request and that the government did not oppose it.The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.Mr. Monico said in a letter to the judge that the prosecutors did not object to a “one-time 60-day extension” of the proposed surrender date “in light of Mr. Cohen’s medical condition.”Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to violating campaign finance laws, financial crimes and lying to Congress in two separate prosecutions, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the other by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.At his sentencing in December, Mr. Cohen apologized for his role in a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of an adult-film star and a former Playboy model who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, in order to help Mr. Trump’s election prospects.“I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,” Mr. Cohen said in court before he was sentenced, “and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man” — referring to President Trump — “that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.”Judge Pauley, at the request of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, has recommended that he serve his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y., which is about 75 miles northwest of New York City.

Magazine Draws Criticism for ‘Target Practice’ Headline With Photo of Pelosi and GiffordsAdvertisementSupported byN.R.A. Magazine Draws Criticism for ‘Target Practice’ Headline With Photo of Pelosi and GiffordsImageFrom left, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and Representative Lucy McBath at the Capitol last month.CreditCreditMichael Reynolds/EPA, via ShutterstockBy Emily S. RuebFeb. 24, 2019The March issue of the National Rifle Association’s monthly publication, The American Rifleman, features a photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona who was shot in the head during a constituent meeting in 2011.The photo, taken last month at an announcement about proposed legislation to expand background checks for firearms purchases, carried the headline in large letters: “Target Practice.”The article, written by Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the N.R.A.’s lobbying arm, described Ms. Pelosi as an “arch anti-gunner,” and said the proposal was being “deceptively marketed to the public” and was “a broadside against gun ownership in America.”On Friday, a political reporter at HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, posted photographs of the article on Twitter, setting off rounds of criticism about the juxtaposition of the headline and photo.Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., condemned the N.R.A. and said on Twitter that the layout was an “incitement of violence.”Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has been a vocal supporter of gun restrictions since the 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., said on Twitter that the magazine’s editorial decisions were not accidental.Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat of California, said on Twitter that the layout was “a call for violence” and that the N.R.A. “should face legal consequences.”ImageThe recent issue of The American Rifleman, a magazine from the N.R.A., has drawn criticism for this headline and photo.“But let’s put them out of business with boycotts and ballot boxes,” he wrote.Responding to Mr. Swalwell, Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas, denied that the N.R.A. was targeting Democrats.“How can you claim this? Are you deliberately lying or did you just not read it?” Mr. Crenshaw wrote on Twitter. “The article is about legislation targeting gun owners, not the N.R.A. targeting Democrats. If your goal is to ensure that ‘outrage culture’ is alive and well, continuing to divide us, congrats.”The N.R.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, an umbrella group that supports gun violence prevention and that was named for Ms. Giffords, called the headline “reprehensible.”“Evoking threats of violence should never be tolerated,” he said. “Words matter. This headline should tell us all we need to know about how wildly out of touch the N.R.A. is with its own members and how low they will stoop to advance their damaging agenda at the expense of our safety.”A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi declined to comment, but her daughter Christine Pelosi said on Twitter that this “hate speech” should not get in the way of “common sense gun violence prevention such as #HR8,” the congressional background check bill, which is expected to come to the House floor for a vote this week.The N.R.A. magazine’s latest issue surfaced after high-profile government officials were the recent targets of veiled or explicit threats of violence.President Trump’s longtime adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., who is under indictment on charges brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, posted a photo of the federal judge handling his criminal case with what appeared to be the cross hairs of a gun near her head.Separately, Ms. Pelosi’s name emerged on a list of Democrats and journalists that officials said was put together by Christopher P. Hasson, a Coast Guard lieutenant whom federal investigators labeled a “domestic terrorist.” They said he planned to assassinate prominent figures.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: A Photograph, a Magazine Headline and a Wave of Online Criticism for the N.R.A..

Want this by email? Sign up here.China trade talks turn to currencyThis week’s trade negotiations between the U.S. and China will have to bridge a lot of gulfs between the two countries. One particularly tricky issue is that Washington wants Beijing to adopt a policy that would keep the value of China’s currency stable. More on that from Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources:• “While the precise wording remains unresolved, a pledge of yuan stability has been discussed in multiple rounds of talks in recent months and both sides have tentatively agreed it will be part of the framework of any final deal.”• “The Trump administration has been clear in its talks with Beijing that any attempt to depreciate the yuan — a strategy aimed at offsetting existing U.S. duties on Chinese imports — would be met with more or higher American tariffs.”• But currency stability may be at odds with other policies. “A U.S. request for Beijing to keep the yuan from depreciating is also potentially difficult to square with Trump and past U.S. administrations’ calls for China to adopt more market-driven reforms and complaints that Beijing manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantage.”There are other contentious issues. The FT rated the chances of success of several critical issues being discussed this week, from stronger protections of intellectual property rights (likely to happen) to the cessation of hacking (much less likely).And any deal would need enforcement measures. CNBC reports that unidentified officials from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believe a deal would be meaningless if there aren’t mechanisms such as automatic tariff increases to punish China if it fails to keep its promises.But there appears to be less time pressure. President Trump said yesterday that the March 1 deadline for reaching an agreement “is not a magical date,” adding that “a lot of things can happen.”Can Theresa May get what she wants from Brussels?The British prime minister is meeting with European officials today in an attempt to reach a final compromise that would save her Brexit plan. It won’t be easy.Her goal is to revise the deal. “The British government sees May’s meeting on Wednesday with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as a crucial chance to get legally binding changes” to the agreement, Bloomberg reports.She has dropped some controversial ideas to help her position. The FT reports that the notion of using technology to solve issues surrounding the Irish border — a plan considered unworkable by E.U. officials — has been abandoned.But Europe still isn’t budging. “There isn’t enough movement for me to be able to expect this to be a discussion with a concrete outcome,” Mr. Juncker said yesterday, later adding “I’m losing my time with this Brexit,” according to Bloomberg.More Brexit news: Britain is unlikely to secure trade deals with Japan and South Korea before it exits the E.U. Another lawmaker has left Britain’s opposition Labour Party to join a newly formed independent group. Three Conservative Party lawmakers have also resigned to join the new group. Honda may move some of the British production of its Civic model to the U.S. — and other Japanese automakers may also leave the country.ImageSenator Bernie SandersCreditPete Marovich/EPA, via ShutterstockHow a Bernie Sanders presidency would affect businessThe Vermont senator finally tossed his hat into the 2020 ring yesterday, becoming the latest candidate seeking the Democratic Party nomination. Mr. Sanders quickly became one of the most formidable candidates: He raised more than $4 million from individual donors in just one day and retains a big fan base from his 2016 run.CNBC breaks down how Mr. Sanders would affect the business world should he become president:• His Medicare-for-all concept, introduced in 2017, proposes moving Americans away from private health insurance to a government-provided policy. He has also pressed to cut drug prices.• He has long criticized big banks, and has fought to break up institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Earlier this month, he also teamed up with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, on legislation to limit companies’ ability to buy back stock.• He wants a higher minimum wage of $15 an hour, and has put pressure on Amazon, Walmart and other companies to follow suit.But there’s a big caveat to his 2020 odds. As Sydney Ember of the NYT notes: “Much of his populist agenda has been embraced by other Democrats, at a time when many voters are eager to elevate female and nonwhite standard bearers.”California and the U.S. hit an impasse over vehicle standardsTalks between state and federal officials on vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards have broken down, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources:• The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had been meeting with California’s Air Resources Board to try and compromise on a replacement for Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.• “The breakdown in talks adds to tension between Washington and Sacramento, which has emerged as a major antagonist to the Trump administration.”• “No further discussions are scheduled over the critical auto industry rules, said the people, who asked to not be identified discussing the private talks.”• California is America’s biggest auto market, and as such has set a de facto national standard for auto emissions.How Trump tried to stymie investigationsThe NYT took a deep dive into how President Trump has sought to clamp down on the many investigations that touch upon his presidency over the past two years. Among the incidents the newspaper uncovered:He tried to install a loyalist as head of the Michael Cohen inquiry. “He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call,” the NYT reports. The acting attorney general at the time, Matthew Whitaker, demurred.He wanted a misleading public statement about Michael Flynn’s resignation. As White House officials discussed how to explain the departure of Mr. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, amid an F.B.I. investigation, the president asked Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, to say he had requested Mr. Flynn’s resignation. When Mr. Spicer asked if that was true, Mr. Trump responded, “Say that I asked for his resignation.”He has sought to discredit the special counsel, Robert Mueller. With the arrival of Rudy Giuliani on his legal team, Mr. Trump “decided to combine a legal strategy with a public relations campaign in an aggressive effort to undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” the NYT reports. The result: Polls last summer showed more Americans distrusted Mr. Mueller, prompting Mr. Giuliani to say, “I think we’ve done really well.”The S.E.C. wants to make I.P.O.s easierThe Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled a proposal yesterday that would let all companies — not just certain small ones — confidentially discuss potential I.P.O. plans with investors before committing to the process, the WSJ reports:• “The conversations would allow companies to identify information that is important to investors and to gauge market interest before formally announcing a public offering.”• “Currently, large companies must publicly file their securities offering documents to regulators before gauging investor interest.”• “Making it easier and more appealing for companies to go public has been a central goal of S.E.C. Chairman Jay Clayton. The number of public companies has fallen by nearly 50 percent since the late 1990s.”• But this potential change isn’t as revolutionary as others the S.E.C. has proposed, Anna Pinedo of the law firm Mayer Brown told the WSJ. “It’s not going to single-handedly change if a company was going to decide to go public or not,” she said.Walmart had a great quarter — and an awful morningThe American retail giant is riding high after a banner earnings report yesterday, with its shares up as much as 4 percent in Tuesday trading. Here’s why:• Profits rose 69 percent to $3.69 billion.• Online sales were up 43 percent during the quarter, matching the company’s goal.• Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 4.2 percent in the quarter, above the 3.2 percent that analysts had expected.But Britain’s competition regulator dealt it bad news this morning by essentially blocking the company’s plan to merge its Asda grocery chain with J Sainsbury. The move hinders Walmart’s effort to shed the underperforming business, since it’s unclear how the American retailer can divest it.ImageA development in Plano, Tex.CreditBrandon Thibodeaux for The New York TimesWhy housing (probably) won’t start a recessionThe U.S. may be on the brink of a recession, but housing is unlikely to be the cause, Conor Dougherty of the NYT writes. Here’s why:• “The housing sector accounts for as little as 3 percent of economic output during recessions and about twice that during booms. Other pieces of the economy are much bigger, but they don’t change nearly as much from boom to bust.”• “The most recent recession, from 2007 to 2009, offered one of the more exaggerated examples of housing’s guiding role in downturns. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that the construction sector accounted for a little over a third of the decline in output in the past recession.”• “How does housing look now? Mixed, but mixed in such a way that the things most important to economic growth are the most stable.”• “When economists talk about a recession in housing, they largely refer to construction, not home prices,” and “construction is bordering on moribund.”• “In other words: Housing is in recession already. It might not get better soon, but it probably won’t get worse.”Revolving doorPresident Trump will nominate Jeffrey Rosen as deputy attorney general, replacing Rod Rosenstein.Marc Short, who was President Trump’s legislative director for two years, has become Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff.Lindsay Walters, a White House deputy press secretary, will leave in April to join Edelman, the P.R. firm.CNN hired Sarah Isgur Flores, the Justice Department’s spokeswoman under Jeff Sessions, as a political editor in Washington.The speed readDeals• Carl Icahn publicly urged Caesars Entertainment to sell itself.

Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, was scheduled to testify before a House committee, he said he was going to let the American people decide “exactly who’s telling the truth.”CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Maggie Haberman and Nicholas FandosFeb. 26, 2019WASHINGTON — In an atmosphere of high drama and low tactics, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, prepared for his explosive public testimony about the president on Wednesday even as a Republican member of Congress threatened to reveal what he said were Mr. Cohen’s extramarital affairs.Mr. Cohen’s long-awaited appearance before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, coming after he spent Tuesday behind closed doors answering questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee, is likely to be among the more revealing and polarizing moments of Mr. Trump’s presidency.[Mr. Cohen plans to use his testimony on Wednesday to unspool a narrative laced with regret of his decade working alongside Mr. Trump.]With the partisan stakes so high, Representative Matt Gaetz, a firebrand Republican from Florida, went after Mr. Cohen pre-emptively with a personal attack that some Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation.“Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot,” Mr. Gaetz said on Twitter.In a statement, Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer and spokesman for Mr. Cohen, said he would not respond to what he called “Mr. Gaetz’s despicable lies and personal smears,” but called on both parties to “repudiate his words and his conduct.”Late Wednesday night, Mr. Gaetz walked back his remarks after Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a warning, saying that such comments could affect the committee’s ability to “obtain the truthful and complete information necessary.”“While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did,” Mr. Gaetz tweeted. “I’m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I’m sorry.”In his public testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen plans to describe “in granular detail” a scheme hatched in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election to make hush money payments to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, people familiar with his plans said. And he will say the scheme, which led to a campaign finance-related charge against him, was initiated by Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen will not be allowed to publicly discuss matters related to the continuing special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian election manipulation efforts. Those topics were sure to have been covered on Tuesday in his closed-door appearance with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will be again on Thursday in secret testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.Mr. Cohen’s testimony — coming as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, prepares to conclude his investigation, and with House Democrats starting their own — signals the beginning of what could be a perilous new phase for Mr. Trump’s presidency.Mr. Gaetz’s threat and the enraged reaction to it reflected the stakes on Capitol Hill in anticipation of Wednesday’s open hearing.Neither Mr. Cohen nor members of the Senate Intelligence Committee provided details of his testimony on Tuesday. Mr. Cohen began his meeting with the senators by apologizing for lying to them in 2017 about the duration of time during the 2016 campaign that the Trump Organization was in discussions about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, people familiar with what took place said.Mr. Cohen emerged from a secure room in the Senate after more than eight hours of questioning and told reporters that he appreciated “the opportunity that was given to me” to tell the truth.“I look forward to tomorrow to be able to, in my voice, tell the American people my story,” he said. “I am going to let the American people decide exactly who’s telling the truth.”Senators who sat through the session indicated that Mr. Cohen’s testimony had made a strong impression on them. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Mr. Cohen appeared to be “humbled by the experience he has been through and what he knows lies ahead of him.”Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s top Democrat, said the committee’s investigation was the most important thing he was doing in the Senate. “Nothing I heard from today dissuades me from that view,” he said.Mr. Trump and his allies have been preparing for days for the appearance and for the potential for a split-screen drama as the president meets in Vietnam with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. The president’s aides have been anxious about the effect that the testimony might have on him.Even before Mr. Gaetz’s tweet, Mr. Trump’s Republican allies in the House were prepared to aggressively question Mr. Cohen’s credibility. They have signaled that they will dig into his own past business dealings and publicly documented attempts to monetize his relationship with the president to try to paint Mr. Cohen as a liar fabricating stories to lessen his time in jail.In a statement on Tuesday morning, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denounced Mr. Cohen as a “disgraced felon” who was already “going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements.”“It’s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,” she said.Mr. Gaetz’s tweet took the effort to undermine Mr. Cohen to another level.In a text earlier Wednesday, Mr. Gaetz rejected assertions that his tweet could amount to witness intimidation.“It’s testing the veracity and character of Michael Cohen,” he wrote. “That is allowed.”Like all members of Congress, Mr. Gaetz is covered under the “speech or debate” clause of the Constitution, which grants lawmakers wide latitude in their comments when Congress is in session and has been cited many times in the past as protection against punishment.A federal law makes it a crime to intimidate or threaten people in an attempt to influence, delay or prevent their testimony in official proceedings, and a congressional hearing certainly counts.It is not clear, though, whether a loose, ambiguous and public statement on social media qualifies and whether constitutional protections for congressional speech and debate would shield Mr. Gaetz from some forms of liability.Randall D. Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white-collar criminal law at George Washington University, said a successful criminal prosecution of Mr. Gaetz appeared to be unlikely on the available evidence.“There’s a real tendency these days to leap immediately to allegations of criminal misconduct,” Mr. Eliason said. “There are a lot of things that are reprehensible but not criminal. I think proving the required corrupt intent to obstruct justice based on a single, public tweet would be pretty difficult.”There are other possible remedies. The Constitution allows the House to “punish its members for disorderly behavior,” and it is at least conceivable that Mr. Gaetz could face some form of discipline from his colleagues.Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a veteran Democrat from New Jersey, said on Twitter that Mr. Gaetz’s comments were “grossly unethical and probably illegal,” raising the possibility of witness intimidation.“House Ethics must investigate this disgrace and stain on our institution,” he wrote.Mr. Gaetz later defended his comments in a brief speech on the House floor, saying it is “entirely appropriate for any member of this body to challenge the truthfulness, veracity and character of people who have a history of lying and have a future that undoubtedly contains nothing but lies.”Mr. Gaetz has developed a reputation as a champion of Mr. Trump who, like the president, is unafraid of making statements many would consider outlandish. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control, he got into an argument with parents of students killed last year in a massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and sought to have them ejected.Mr. Cohen’s team has suggested that it is prepared for Republican efforts to impugn his credibility. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to violating campaign finance laws, financial crimes and lying to Congress in two separate prosecutions, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the other by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Cohen was disbarred on Tuesday in New York State.Public testimony provides Mr. Cohen with an opportunity to tell his story under penalty of perjury before an audience of millions of people, about two months before he is scheduled to report to prison.Mr. Cohen has spent more than 70 hours with investigators for the special counsel investigating possible conspiracy by the Trump campaign with Russian officials, as well as with investigators from the Southern District of New York.Carl Hulse and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.

Blue/BloombergA crucial question of the Trump years has always been: Will our institutions hold? Will the legal, political and social institutions of American life be able to withstand the norm-destroying corruption of King Chaos?The U.S. Congress has not fared well. Many Republicans have been supine while Donald Trump has shriveled congressional authority and shredded the rules of basic democratic behavior.The American legal system, however, seems to be holding up pretty well. Even under the intense Trumpian pressure my Times colleagues described earlier in the week.Robert Mueller is a solid rock in the face of waves of calumny. If anything, the investigators at the Southern District of New York seem to be picking up the pace. These investigations are being led, it should be noted, by Republicans.The S.D.N.Y. investigation seems to be zeroing in on the $107 million Trump inauguration extravaganza. From the hints dropped by the subpoenas, one gets the impression that the inauguration was a shambolic grabfest in which people with money tried to turn it into power and people who suddenly had power tried to turn it into money.Some legal experts believe the inauguration is being aggressively probed as a racketeering operation — a continuing criminal enterprise, complete with mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and the rest.So why aren’t the legal authorities wilting? One explanation: institutions and character. The legal institutions instill codes of excellence that are strong enough to take the heat. The people in authority have enough character to live up to those codes.The head of the S.D.N.Y. office is Geoffrey Berman, a Trump appointee. Berman has recused himself where that is appropriate and pushed ahead where that is appropriate. The people on his team are famously independent professionals.Let’s just pick out one, to illustrate the type: the man Berman chose to be his deputy, Robert Khuzami.Khuzami was born in Brooklyn (you can’t understand the Trump presidency without understanding the resentments and cultural geography of the New York boroughs) and raised in Rochester. According to a 2013 Times DealBook story, he was born into a bohemian family, with ballroom-dancer parents, a muralist sister and a drummer brother. They joke that Robert is the “white sheep” in the family. He began college at the State University of New York at Geneseo before transferring to the University of Rochester. He supported himself as a dishwasher, bartender and overnight dockworker. He went to Boston University law school and his career took off.Khuzami has served through three separate intense investigations. In the 1990s he was part of the team that prosecuted Omar Abdel Rahman, the “Blind Sheikh,” who led a foiled plot to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks. In 2009, in the wake of the financial crash, he was named head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, revitalizing a demoralized unit. And now he is part of a team taking on the president of the United States.In between his government service, he’s taken lucrative private sector jobs, as general counsel for Deutsche Bank and as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.Andy McCarthy was one of Khuzami’s fellow prosecutors in the Blind Sheikh case. In his book “Willful Blindness,” McCarthy describes Khuzami as fearless, dogged and willing to contend with the thorniest knots of evidence. In an email to me, McCarthy wrote that Khuzami “is as terrific as you may suspect he is.”Over the years, Khuzami’s employees have generally described him as intimidating but likable. He was intimidating after the financial crisis. In the 2011 fiscal year, for example, the S.E.C. brought a record 735 enforcement actions. In the same year, his division collected $2.8 billion in penalties and disgorgement.His critics have often come from the left. Khuzami spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, in defense of the Patriot Act. Some argue, plausibly, that as general counsel to Deutsche Bank from 2004 to 2009, he should have been aware of the financial shenanigans of that era. Others argue that since he’s been through the revolving door between the elite firms and big government, he’s actually been soft on Wall Street bigs, charging them penalties but not actually holding them responsible.The critics may have a point. But when you look at Khuzami and the prosecutors like him, you see people who had been formed — who have been carved by institutions and experience for a moment and role like this.Khuzami is a tested professional. He’s proved his skill at the highest levels. He’s a Wall Street and legal insider. He’s seen national security, Wall Street and white-collar corruption from all angles. And he’s a patriot. He’s given up lucrative jobs to serve.The point of this is not to lionize Khuzami. He’s part of a team. There are teams like that spread anonymously throughout the U.S. government. They are clinging tenaciously to the old standards of right and wrong, to the Constitution and the rule of law. And if we get through this, it will be because of people like them.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Feb. 28, 2019ImagePresident Donald Trump with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as they headed to a meeting at the Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesHaving participated in nuclear negotiations with North Korea, I know what failure smells like. The truncated Hanoi summit, which concluded abruptly without an agreement between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, carried an awful stench.There were high expectations for this second meeting of American and North Korean leaders after the lack of progress on denuclearization commitments made at their first summit, in Singapore last summer. And yet, not only did Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim fail to offer more empty promises, they even dispensed with signing a joint statement, canceled their planned ceremonial lunch, and skipped the joint news conference.This outcome shouldn’t necessarily be a surprise. Presidential summits are supposed to be painstakingly manufactured for success by working-level diplomats. This one wasn’t. Mr. Trump’s eagerness to have the top-level meeting early — perhaps to draw headlines away from domestic turmoil — contravened the advice of his best advisers to do the necessary work before putting the president in front of the North Korean leader again.The pre-summit speculation was that Pyongyang might turn over a few of its nuclear facilities for international inspection and offer a freeze on operations at others; in return the United States might consider the partial lifting of economic sanctions, the establishment of liaison offices as a first step to diplomatic normalization, and maybe even declare an official end to the Korean War. These are a lot of moving parts, which speaks to the fact that negotiating with North Korea is — or at least involves — rocket science. Mr. Trump, whatever he thinks of his deal-making skills, cannot simply “wing it.”Though the president never should have gotten himself into this position, he still probably did the right thing leaving Hanoi empty-handed. No deal is better than a bad deal. Mr. Kim apparently wanted to turn over only some old nuclear facilities for freezing and inspection, including the reactor complex at Yongbyon, but in return he reportedly demanded the lifting of all United States and United Nations sanctions. That would have been a sucker’s deal. Mr. Trump, in turn, asked for access to additional facilities and bases that are more crucial to the North’s nuclear program. Mr. Kim balked.RelatedOpinionThink Military Strikes Could Stop North Korea? Try It and See.This simulation shows it’s not so simple.May 24, 2018But what next? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Trump both tried to put the best face they could on Hanoi: “real progress was made,” Mr. Pompeo said. Or, as the president put it, “when we walked away it was a very friendly walk.” But when leaders’ summits fail to reach agreement, diplomacy has, by definition, reached the end of its rope.That leaves a great deal of uncertainty going forward. The South Koreans will frantically seek meetings with Washington and Pyongyang to try to pick up the pieces by offering humanitarian assistance to the North and eliciting reaffirmations from Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim that they will remain committed to diplomacy. Meanwhile, the North Koreans already have sent an envoy to China to chart the next steps. Beijing will hear complaints from both Americans and North Koreans about how the other side was unreasonable, but will do little to press Pyongyang to agree to allow inspections at its core nuclear facilities.It wasn’t long ago that Mr. Trump was tweeting threats about “fire and fury” and armed conflict between North Korea and the United States seemed entirely possible. Thankfully, a return to that level of tension seems unlikely. But the situation could easily take a turn for the worse. If Washington wants to put more pressure on North Korea, it could introduce further economic sanctions or restart military training exercises with the South Koreans, which were suspended in October to encourage diplomacy. For his part, Mr. Kim will have to decide whether he will break the self-imposed moratorium on testing weapons of mass destruction, which has held for the past 15 months.Mr. Trump’s early post-summit statements don’t suggest he will move the needle on economic and military pressure, and recent commercial satellite imagery does not suggest a North Korean weapons test is imminent, either. But we are left with two disquieting problems after the Hanoi summit: First, the leaders could not produce an agreement on a cessation of North Korean weapons and fissile material production. Experts believe Pyongyang may have already made material for as many as eight new bombs in the period between the Singapore and Hanoi summits.And second, Mr. Trump will not be yearning for another summit with Mr. Kim any time soon. Indeed, he may lose interest in the issue as he becomes distracted by the Mueller report, trade negotiations with China, Venezuela’s political crisis, and Indo-Pakistan relations. And if he gives up on diplomacy completely, then it’s either back to the fire-and-fury of 2017 or the de facto acceptance of North Korea as a state armed with nuclear weapons. Either outcome will make Americans less secure.Victor Cha (@VictorDCha) is a professor of government at Georgetown University and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Eileen SullivanFeb. 19, 2019阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版Leer en españolWASHINGTON — President Trump has called the Russia investigation a hoax, a witch hunt and fake news. But since he has been in office, Mr. Trump has tried to end the inquiry into his campaign’s possible coordination with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, opening himself up to questions about whether these efforts constitute attempts to obstruct justice.A review by The New York Times found a continuous, behind-the-scenes effort by Mr. Trump to undermine multiple investigations that have touched his presidency. His efforts included seeking to derail federal law enforcement through targeted political appointments and a public campaign to discredit the Russia investigation, which is led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Here are some takeaways from The Times report about pressure inside the Trump administration to protect the president from those inquiries.[Read the full article here.]Mr. Trump wanted to put a perceived loyalist in charge of a federal inquiry in New York related to hush money payments made by his former personal lawyer.After subjecting his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to protracted humiliation over Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and then firing him, Mr. Trump asked his newly installed acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, if one of the president’s perceived allies could take control of the federal investigation in New York involving him.Mr. Whitaker, a loyalist who had told people that his job was to protect the president, said no. The person Mr. Trump wanted, Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had already recused himself over another routine conflict of interest.Mr. Whitaker has told associates that part of his job was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, a comment not previously reported. But there is no evidence that Mr. Whitaker took further steps to wrest the sprawling inquiry from career Justice Department prosecutors. Mr. Whitaker did tell some associates that the New York prosecutors needed “adult supervision.”Mr. Trump’s public attacks on the Russia investigation have evolved from a public relations strategy to a legal strategy.The president’s assault on investigators on Twitter and in public interviews moved beyond his typical criticism of individuals into a mosaic of efforts to undermine every facet of the investigation. That includes attacking the investigators, raising questions about the legitimacy of law enforcement investigative tools and discrediting witnesses — most of whom were close allies he once praised.The president cheered efforts by Republican loyalists in Congress who began investigations into cases and pressed for details about confidential Justice Department investigative procedures. One loyalist, Representative Matt Gaetz, a second-term Republican from Florida, spearheaded this campaign in July 2017 while he killed time at an airport in between flights.Mr. Trump’s lawyers liked the lawmakers’ campaign to erode Americans’ confidence in the F.B.I., the federal government’s premier law enforcement agency. And they especially liked that Mr. Trump has been a persistent and public participant in it, because, the lawyers say, it is implausible that Mr. Trump could be part of a secret conspiracy.Trump Has Publicly Attacked the Russia Investigation More Than 1,100 TimesPresident Trump has publicly criticized federal investigations, opening him up to possible obstruction of justice charges.White House lawyers wrote a confidential memo about misleading public statements after the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser.White House lawyers were concerned about the varying public accounts of the reasons behind Mr. Flynn’s abrupt departure. Mr. Flynn resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, after it was reported that he was in touch with Russia’s ambassador to the United States at the end of 2016 and discussed recent Obama administration sanctions. Mr. Flynn said he resigned because he “inadvertently” misled Vice President Mike Pence and other senior White House officials about his discussions with the Russian ambassador.The next day, the president and his advisers met in the Oval Office to discuss how to explain Mr. Flynn’s departure. One of the advisers mentioned in passing that the House speaker at the time, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, told reporters that the president had asked Mr. Flynn to resign. Mr. Trump liked that version better than the explanation Mr. Flynn gave in his resignation letter and instructed his press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, to “say that” when he briefed the news media.Mr. Trump believed he put an end to the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Flynn.During a lunch with one of his longtime allies, Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, Mr. Trump said that firing Mr. Flynn would end the Russia inquiry.“This Russia thing is all over now because I fired Flynn,” Mr. Trump said, according to a new book by Mr. Christie.Mr. Christie disagreed with that assessment. “This Russia thing is far from over,” Mr. Christie wrote that he told Mr. Trump, who responded: “What do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over.”Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was also at the lunch with Mr. Christie and viewed the firing the way his father-in-law did. “That’s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing,” Mr. Kushner said, according to Mr. Christie’s book.Related CoverageIntimidation, Pressure and Humiliation: Inside Trump’s Two-Year War on the Investigations Encircling HimFeb. 19, 2019ImageTrump Has Publicly Attacked the Russia Investigation More Than 1,100 TimesFeb. 19, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWas Russia Treason Trial About U.S. Election Meddling or a Convict’s Revenge? - The New York Times

KramerFeb. 26, 2019MOSCOW — The treason trial of some of Russia’s top cybersecurity officials ended on Tuesday without solving the mysteries at the center of the case: Why had the men been arrested and what, if anything, did they have to do with Russia’s efforts to disrupt the 2016 American presidential election? Was the prosecution driven not by geopolitical concerns but by a businessman’s desire for revenge?The case began when Russian counterintelligence investigators seized several leading cybersecurity officials in raids conducted in early December 2016. With the arrests coming one month after the American election, speculation swirled that the men had been caught leaking information that helped the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s election hacking.But no clear evidence of that has ever emerged, and the drawn-out trial wrapped up in a Moscow military courtroom without shedding any official light on the reasons for the arrests or if the timing of them, coming so close to the election, signaled a connection to the Russian meddling.Under the watchful eye of security forces wearing ski masks, journalists were allowed into the courtroom for the first time on Tuesday to hear the verdict. Speaking for about 10 minutes, a judge convicted the two main figures and sentenced them to lengthy terms in prison for treason, without saying why.Sergei Mikhailov, a former deputy director of the computer crimes unit of the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the K.G.B., was sentenced to 22 years in a penal colony on two counts of treason.Ruslan Stoyanov, a senior researcher at Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus company, was sentenced to 14 years on one count of treason. Two other suspects had earlier pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.Both men convicted Tuesday had for years cooperated with United States law enforcement and Western computer security researchers on bread-and-butter cybercrime issues like stopping spam and bank fraud.But then came the election hacking scandal in 2016, and the men’s arrests signaled that this type of cooperation would stop.Cooperating with the United States was “something that went out of fashion after the scandal,” said Andrei Soldatov, the author of “The Red Web,” and an authority on Russian internet policies.As part of the election interference operation, two Russian hacking groups intruded into the servers of the Democratic National Committee. One group was affiliated with the F.S.B., Mr. Mikhailov’s agency, and the other with the Russian military intelligence organization known as the G.R.U., according to United States government officials and cybersecurity researchers who studied the breach.Only the G.R.U. leaked the stolen information, according to a United States interagency report on the hacking released in 2017. The special counsel investigating Russian meddling, Robert S. Mueller III, last year indicted 12 G.R.U. officers.The detailed accusations by American intelligence agencies against Russia, and the stated high level of confidence in their findings, gave rise to questions about whether they had sources inside Russia.ImageRobert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers last year.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesLeaks about the treason case reported in the Russian news media, as well as interviews with defense lawyers and a witness, have indicated that the defendants’ ties to American officials long predated the presidential campaign, and that the information they passed on was not directly related to the hacking investigation.Kommersant, a Russian newspaper, reported this month that Mr. Mikhailov and Mr. Stoyanov were accused of revealing to the F.B.I. information about F.S.B. investigative methods while cooperating with American colleagues on a criminal case nearly a decade ago.Mr. Mikhailov, through intermediaries, passed the data to the F.B.I. in 2011 while investigating ChronoPay, a Russian online payments processing company, the newspaper report said, potentially opening a window on money flows in the Russian online underworld — information that could also be useful in the investigation of the election hacking.At the time, Russia was under diplomatic pressure from the United States and Canada to prosecute the company’s owner, Pavel Vrublevsky, for selling counterfeit erectile dysfunction pills to Americans through websites. Mr. Vrublevsky has denied ties to that scheme.Mr. Mikhailov led the successful prosecution of Mr. Vrublevsky on a separate accusation of hacking the payment system for online ticket sales at Aeroflot, the Russian national airline.Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, a defense lawyer, Inga Lebedeva, told reporters that Mr. Vrublevsky had initiated the treason case in a vendetta against the F.S.B. official and the cybercrime researcher who had put him in prison in the Aeroflot case.“His goal was revenge,” Ms. Lebedeva said. At no point during the closed trial, she said, had Russian meddling in the 2016 United States election come up.“The boys think that in their activities against hackers and criminals they stepped on somebody’s tail,” Ms. Lebedeva said of the two defendants. She said both men would appeal their convictions.Mr. Vrublevsky, in an interview, said he had testified against the pair in the treason trial and believed that they had indeed illegally passed information to the American authorities, but not about election hacking. “These guys were selling fairy tales to the United States about people doing business, like me,” he said.Still, the arrests amounted to a purge of the leadership of the cyberwing of Russia’s main intelligence agency in the midst of the electoral hacking scandal, an issue carrying immense implications for Russia’s relations with the United States.Along with Mr. Mikhailov, who was reportedly dragged from an F.S.B. meeting with a bag over his head, Russian counterintelligence officers detained his deputy, Dmitry A. Dokuchaev. Mr. Dokuchaev pleaded guilty in the treason case.The United States has not accused Mr. Dokuchaev of having any role in the election hacking but has indicted him in a separate cybercrime case that overlaps with sanctions imposed on Russians for election meddling. Federal authorities in Washington and San Francisco in 2017 accused Mr. Dokuchaev, who at the time was also facing the treason charge in Russia, of doubling as a cybercriminal while working at the F.S.B. He was accused of hacking Yahoo and stealing 500 million passwords.That indictment identified him as having overseen the work of one of three others named in the Yahoo hack, a suspected cybercriminal, Aleksei A. Belan, whom the Obama administration placed under sanctions in relation to the election hacking.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Was Treason Trial About ’16 Meddling or Convict’s Revenge?.

Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted in federal court of a wide-ranging financial scheme, but could also face state charges.CreditCreditRick Wilking/ReutersBy William K. Rashbaum and Benjamin WeiserFeb. 26, 2019Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, is now in the sights of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., whose office is set to bring charges against him. A federal jury in Virginia already convicted Mr. Manafort in a financial fraud scheme that could send him to prison for decades, and he has pleaded guilty in Washington to other federal charges.But Mr. Vance’s prosecutors, who are said to be preparing charges to try to ensure that Mr. Manafort faces prison even if he is pardoned by the president, will most likely face a pitched legal battle and a political firefight.A federal jury in August convicted Mr. Manafort of using foreign accounts to hide millions of dollars from his political consulting work in Ukraine, tax fraud and of lying to banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans. State charges, which would be brought by Mr. Vance, would be based on some of those same loans, which were issued by Citizens Bank in Rhode Island and Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Mr. Manafort’s lawyers are almost certain to challenge any state charges on grounds of double jeopardy, and Mr. Vance, a left-leaning district attorney in a blue state, could face the inevitable accusation that his prosecution of a member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle is politically motivated.Here is how this may play out.What is double jeopardy?Put simply, it is the legal principle that a defendant may not be prosecuted twice for the same crime. This tenet of American jurisprudence is enshrined in the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment states: No person shall be “subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.”New York State law provides even stronger protections against double jeopardy. But some exceptions exist. Double jeopardy applies once a jury is sworn in a criminal case, whether the defendant is convicted or acquitted. However, juries sometimes cannot decide on a verdict on a particular charge, which is what happened with several counts in Mr. Manafort’s federal case in Virginia. That could leave the door open for Mr. Vance’s office to pursue state charges — such as falsifying business records or mortgage fraud — in those instances.“I don’t imagine when presented with someone whose career is alleged to have been as varied and crooked as Manafort’s, the D.A.’s office would have to stretch itself to find conduct that could be charged without violating New York’s double jeopardy provisions,” said Daniel C. Richman, a Columbia Law School professor.Can the president pardon Manafort on state charges?No. The United States Constitution confers broad authority on the president to issue pardons in federal cases. Indeed, the president can even pardon people before they are charged or convicted of a federal crime, although such actions are rare. (President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard M. Nixon, after Watergate, and President Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam draft evaders.) But the president has no power to do so in connection with state crimes.Why people think Trump might pardon ManafortPresident Trump has repeatedly characterized Mr. Manafort as a “brave man,” and indicated that he had not ruled out pardoning his former top campaign official.“It was never discussed, but I wouldn’t take it off the table,” Mr. Trump said in November in an Oval Office interview with The New York Post. “Why would I take it off the table?” the president added.In the interview, Mr. Trump also likened the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought charges against Mr. Manafort, to McCarthyism. “This is no better than McCarthy,” the president said, adding, “It’s a terrible thing.”There will be (political) bloodBeyond the legal battle that would follow any charges against Mr. Manafort in New York, there could be political fallout.Mr. Vance’s taking aim at a member of the president’s inner circle, whether he has been pardoned or not, could play into the narrative that the president and his allies have been subjected to partisan persecution — in the president’s words, a “witch hunt.”For Mr. Vance, the decision to prosecute Mr. Manafort would play out before a very different audience. “I assume Vance is motivated in part by political considerations — his constituents expect him to do this,” said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law.“There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as he’s not doing it only for that reason. He has to also believe it’s the right thing to do,” Professor Gillers said.The case against Mr. Manafort also offers Mr. Vance something of an opportunity for redemption. He came under heavy criticism for failing to bring charges against Mr. Trump’s eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., after an investigation into allegations they had lied to buyers of units at the Trump SoHo, a 46-story luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Vance defended his handling of the inquiry, saying he ended it largely because the victims would not cooperate with prosecutors after they reached a civil settlement with the Trumps and their business partners.What happens to Mr. Vance’s charges if there is no pardon?Mr. Vance’s office began building the case in order to ensure that Mr. Manafort would still be held accountable for his crimes, even if the president pardoned him for his federal convictions. But the district attorney’s office is expected to seek charges and prosecute the case against Mr. Manafort regardless of whether Mr. Trump issues a pardon.If no pardon is issued and Mr. Manafort is convicted on state charges, he almost certainly would serve a state prison sentence at the same time as his federal term. Mr. Manafort, 69, has not yet been sentenced on the federal charges.Paradoxically, one legal expert suggested, Mr. Manafort might find himself in a position where a federal pardon portends a far more unpleasant outcome — the prospect of serving time in a New York State institution, where prison life is far more dangerous, dirty and grim.Related CoverageManafort Is Expected to Face Charges in New York, Even if Trump Pardons HimFeb. 22, 2019ImageInvestigations of Manafort in New York Are Beyond Trump’s Power to PardonOct. 30, 2017ImageMueller’s Office Recommends Paul Manafort Serve Up to 25 Years in PrisonFeb. 15, 2019ImageTrump Praises Manafort, Saying ‘Unlike Michael Cohen’ He ‘Refused to Break’Aug. 22, 2018ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsNorth Carolina, Roger Stone, Jussie Smollett: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times

An end may be in sight: The special counsel Robert Mueller is expected to deliver a report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election within weeks.The new attorney general, William Barr, will then have to decide how much of it to make public.In an Op-Ed essay, the acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama argues that the report will most likely act as a “road map” for more investigations, rather than be the beginning of their end.Separately, Roger Stone, a Republican operative who is under indictment in the special counsel’s investigation, is now under a gag order after posting a picture on Instagram of a judge with cross hairs in the corner._____ImageCreditPool photo by Travis Long2.

Above, Mr. Harris testified before the state board of elections today.It was a stunning collapse of Republican efforts to prevail in the final unsettled House race of last year’s midterms.The announcement followed days of testimony in which other witnesses depicted Mr. Harris’s campaign operation as rife with misconduct, including the illegal collection and completion of absentee ballots._____ImageCreditGregorio Borgia/Associated Press3. “We hear the cry of the little ones.”That was Pope Francis at start of a historic four-day conference at the Vatican, with his moral authority in question and his papal legacy in the balance.Before 190 church leaders, he called for “concrete and effective measures” to address clerical sexual abuse — an issue that in some parts of the world has eroded trust in the Roman Catholic Church while being ignored and denied in others.Abuse survivors and their advocates pictured above are in Rome to push for a universal policy of zero tolerance. But Vatican officials say legal and cultural barriers make that virtually impossible._____ImageCreditKate Warren for The New York Times4. China is collecting genetic material as part of its vast campaign of oppression of Muslim minority groups. Critics say the DNA could be used to track and chase down whoever resists conforming.Under the guise of free medical checkups in the western region of Xinjiang, where much of the population is Uighur, the government collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data of tens of millions of people, including the man pictured above. In some cases, people were told the checkups were mandatory.To help them build out the DNA database, China used equipment from a U.S. company, Thermo Fisher, and also got material from a prominent Yale geneticist._____ImageCreditKamil Krzaczynski/Associated Press5.

Above, Venezuelan migrants arriving in Colombia this month.Ahead of a showdown over aid between Mr. Maduro and the opposition on Saturday, the country’s former intelligence chief turned against Mr. Maduro. In an interview with The Times, Hugo Carvajal called him a dictator with a corrupt inner circle and urged the military to break with him.Mr. Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s border with Brazil closed and blocked air and sea traffic with three Caribbean islands to keep out the aid.“How is it that having the power to allow the entry of international humanitarian aid to our country to save lives, you would decide not to?” Mr. Carvajal said in a statement. “Would you be so inhuman?

He’s the man who surrendered the Senate to the president.By Adam JentlesonMr. Jentleson is a former deputy chief of staff to retired Senator Harry Reid. Feb. 18, 2019ImageMitch McConnell in Washington in June 2018.CreditCreditDamon Winter/The New York TimesAmong the casualties of President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build his border wall is the reputation of the majority leader Mitch McConnell as a Senate institutionalist. The evidence of the last few days has confirmed, if there were still any doubt, that he is no such thing. First, he helped prolong the longest government shutdown in American history by insisting that the Senate would act only with explicit approval from the president. Now Mr. McConnell has fully acquiesced in President Trump’s power grab by supporting an emergency declaration, which he opposed just weeks before, aimed at addressing a crisis that Senate Republicans know does not exist. This display of obedience from the leader of a supposedly coequal branch of government is shocking only if you ever believed Mr. McConnell was an institutionalist. But his defining characteristic has always been his willingness to do anything and sacrifice any principle to amass power for himself. What separates him from the garden-variety politicians — what makes him a radical — are the lengths he is willing to go. Seeing this with clarity should help us grasp the danger to which he is subjecting the Senate — and, more important, our democracy.The signs of Mr. McConnell’s malign influence were always there. Before he became a Senate leader, he dedicated himself to opening the floodgates for corporate money to flow into our political system. Mr. McConnell chased the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law all the way to the Supreme Court; the 2003 challenge to the law bears his name. Mr. McConnell lost that one, but his cause prevailed six years later when the Supreme Court overturned restrictions on corporate contributions in Citizens United. In 2010, as minority leader, Mr. McConnell stated that his main goal was not to help our country recover from the Great Recession but to make President Obama a “one-term president.” A self-declared “proud guardian of gridlock,” he presided over an enormous escalation in the use of the filibuster. His innovation was to transform it from a procedural tool used to block bills into a weapon of nullification, deploying it against even routine Senate business to gridlock the legislative process.The two forces that characterized Mr. McConnell’s career, obstruction and increasing the power of corporate money in our democracy, have worked hand in hand to diminish the Senate and paralyze American politics. The flood of outside money incentivized obstruction over cooperation, and a new generation of Republicans embraced Mr. McConnell’s obstructionist tactics. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, owes his standing to a few filibusters and a super PAC: As a freshman senator, he used Mr. McConnell’s tactics to shut down the government in 2013 and parlayed the resulting attention — and fund-raising — to run for president (and lose to Mr. Trump).Republicans actually took the Senate majority in 2014 in large part on claims to restore the Senate. Unsurprisingly, they broke their promises. Under President Trump, Mr. McConnell continued to run roughshod over Senate traditions, jamming the $1.5 trillion tax bill through without so much as a proper hearing. The one place the Senate has functioned efficiently is in judicial confirmations, but even here Mr. McConnell has cast aside bipartisan norms and reduced the Senate to a rubber stamp for some unqualified, extremist judges, including those rated “unqualified” by the American Bar Association.Mr. McConnell is not playing three-dimensional chess. There is no grand strategy or long game — there is only what best serves his narrow interest. And since 2010, Mr. McConnell has been convinced that his interests are best served through strict obedience to the Republican base. That year, his handpicked candidate, Trey Grayson, lost a Senate Republican primary in Kentucky to an insurgent named Rand Paul. It was a humiliating defeat and called into question Mr. McConnell’s power in his own backyard. It also invited a Tea Party challenge against his re-election in 2014.Since that scare, Mr. McConnell has rigidly adhered to whatever the base wants, institutions be damned. When the base wanted Judge Merrick Garland blocked, he obeyed. When the base wanted Mr. Trump embraced, he obeyed. While Paul Ryan was playing Hamlet in the summer of 2016, Mr. McConnell quickly endorsed Mr. Trump, providing institutional cover and repeatedly assuring Republicans that Mr. Trump would “be fine.” Mr. McConnell didn’t think Mr. Trump was going to win — he has said so himself — but he probably figured that the damage could be contained.The crass self-interest at so many turns now poses a danger to our democracy. With Mr. Trump increasingly erratic and Robert Mueller’s investigation advancing, there is simply no reason to believe he will stand up for American institutions when it counts. He has already demonstrated a willingness to put his self-interest above America’s national security: In a classified briefing in 2016, Mr. McConnell reportedly cast doubt on C.I.A. intelligence about Russia’s interference in our election and threatened that if President Obama publicly challenged Russia, he’d twist it into a partisan issue. And when the four congressional leaders drafted a bipartisan letter to the states urging them to take action to protect our election infrastructure against Russian interference, Mr. McConnell categorically rejected all efforts to strengthen the letter.Last week, Mr. McConnell had a choice. He didn’t have to acquiesce to the emergency declaration — he could have asserted the Senate’s independence at a critical time by passing the spending bill without validating Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration. If that prompted a veto, Mr. McConnell could have overridden it. That would be real leadership, and a clear assertion of the Senate’s independence. Instead, he meekly acquiesced in another presidential power grab.In the months ahead, our institutions are likely to be tested as rarely before. Under a strong leader, the Senate could provide a critical counterweight to an out-of-control executive. Instead, we have a man who will put his self-interest first, every single time. We should enter this chapter with clarity and finally see Mr. McConnell for what he is. He’s not an institutionalist. He is the man who surrendered the Senate to Donald Trump.Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff to retired Senator Harry Reid, is the public affairs director at Democracy Forward.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Still, they said, Mr. Martin’s gun — a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun with a laser sight — was never taken away.“Some disgruntled person walked in and had access to a firearm that he shouldn’t have had access to,” said Kristen L. Ziman, the chief of police in Aurora, where the shooting took place.[Read more about the shooting here.]Chief Ziman said that the police were trying to determine why Mr. Martin still had a gun, despite having his permit revoked five years ago.According to Illinois gun law, a person must be granted a Firearm Owners Identification card, or FOID, to possess a firearm. At least two million people in the state have the cards.But under the law, the process of removing firearms from people whose cards have been revoked is weak, making it easy for some to keep their weapons with little threat of enforcement or penalty.That appears to have been the case with Mr. Martin, who the police said received a card in January 2014. That March, he applied for a concealed-carry permit, and a background check revealed that he had a felony conviction for aggravated assault in Mississippi from 1995. With that, the Illinois State Police revoked Mr. Martin’s card and mailed him a letter ordering him to relinquish his firearm and card within 48 hours.The statute allows law enforcement agencies to petition the courts to seize weapons if they aren’t turned in, but in many instances, the remaining weapons go unchecked. Experts said that the state rules — without a clear, mandatory enforcement requirement — leave a gaping loophole for those who choose not to give up their guns. In 2016, only about 4,000 of the 11,000 people whose cards were revoked submitted the mandatory reports explaining what they did with their guns, The Chicago Tribune reported in 2017.Sgt. Bill Rowley, a spokesman for the Aurora Police Department, said the police had no record of being notified by the state police that Mr. Martin had not volunteered his firearm as required in 2014. It was unclear whether Mr. Martin, who lived in Aurora at the time of his death, also lived there in 2014.The police on Saturday gave a fuller account of the deadly events inside the Henry Pratt Company warehouse on Friday afternoon, and identified the five workers — all co-workers of Mr. Martin — who were killed.The victims included some of the company’s most experienced workers but also its newest: Josh Pinkard, who was the plant manager of the warehouse, perished in the shooting, as did Trevor Wehner, who was a student at Northern Illinois University and an intern in the company’s human resources department. Mr. Wehner was expected to graduate from college in May. Friday was the first day of his internship, according to officials from Northern Illinois University.“He knew he wanted to work in the H.R. business and was hoping this internship would lead into a full-time job in the future,” said Winter Lane, Mr. Wehner’s girlfriend of more than three years, who grew up with him in the same small town of Serena, in north central Illinois.Everyone there knew Mr. Wehner. He was kind, the most selfless person she had ever met, she said, someone with a big smile and a personality to match. “He always saw the good in everyone,” she said.Also killed, the police said, were Vicente Juarez, a stock room attendant and forklift operator; Clayton Parks, the human resources manager; and Russell Beyer, a mold operator. Officials at Northern Illinois said that Mr. Parks had also graduated from the university, in 2014, and that it was offering counseling help to those in need. (The school, in DeKalb, Ill., was the site of another mass shooting 11 years ago.)Abby Parks, the wife of Clayton Parks, said he was devoted to their son, Axel, who is 8 months old. “The family we created together was Clay’s greatest joy,” she said. “He took his responsibilities as a husband and father very seriously and held those titles above all else.” The couple had been married since 2016.The police first received several 911 calls at 1:24 p.m. on Friday, as frantic callers said there was a shooter at the warehouse. Mr. Martin had been summoned to what the police described as a “termination meeting” at the warehouse where he had worked for at least 15 years. At least two victims were shot at the scene of that meeting.Four minutes later, the police arrived and were confronted by the gunman. Two of the first four officers to arrive were shot and transported to hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening.According to the police, Mr. Martin then retreated into the 29,000-square-foot building, hiding from officers in a machine shop near the back of the facility. It took about 90 minutes for officers to find, shoot and kill him.Scott Hall, the chief executive of Mueller Water Products, of which the Henry Pratt Company is a subsidiary, said that Friday was “the worst day our company has ever had.”Mr. Martin was being fired on Friday for a “culmination of various workplace rules violations,” he said, declining to describe the violations. The firing came at the end of a “progressive discipline process,” he said.The company conducted a background check upon Mr. Martin’s hiring 15 years ago that did not surface his felony conviction in Mississippi.Before Friday, there was no indication that Mr. Martin was violent. “If we have reason to believe that somebody is going to be violent, we take precautions,” he said. “I can only assume that we did not.”Family members of Mr. Martin arrived at the Aurora police station on Friday afternoon, weeping and hugging one another after officers told them that he was dead.“He was the shooter,” said Tameka Martin, who said she was Mr. Martin’s sister. “He shot officers. If they did shoot him and kill him, they were, I guess, defending themselves.”Ms. Martin said that her brother had told his family that he had lost his job at Henry Pratt. At dinner a few nights ago at their mother’s home, Mr. Martin would barely speak about it. He was “very depressed,” she said.Sarah Mervosh, Julia Jacobs and Richard A.

Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, takes the stand on Wednesday morning to testify publicly against him before the House Oversight Committee.Two nearly simultaneous events and two very different story lines for Mr. Trump. One involves a leader he has assiduously courted and hopes will provide him with, at the minimum, an example of his ability to make peace with the United States’ adversaries. The other involves a former associate who has already detailed the president’s secrets to the special counsel and now will share some of them with the American public.The clashing narratives follow what has become a frustrating pattern for Mr. Trump in which some of his biggest moments on the international stage have been overtaken by events at home. Foreign trips mark critical moments for every president. But for a president in search of evidence to support his claims that he has strengthened the United States’ position in the world, they have not always been the successes he had hoped to portray.From his first foreign trip as president — to Saudi Arabia in 2017 — to his meeting last summer with Queen Elizabeth II, Mr. Trump has often found himself competing for coverage with some new and dramatic turn in the scandals that have consumed his administration.On that inaugural trip, Mr. Trump left the White House for Riyadh, the Saudi capital, just as The New York Times reported that he had admitted to Russians in an Oval Office meeting that firing the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, took “great pressure” off him. The Washington Post then reported that a sitting White House official was under federal investigation for possibly colluding with the Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Trump was preparing to depart on a marathon five-country tour of Asia in November 2017 when the special counsel’s office made its first bombshell indictments, bringing charges against his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as two other campaign associates, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. The president was in Davos, Switzerland, when The Times reported that Mr. Trump had ordered the firing of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is overseeing the Russia investigation, and had backed down only when the White House counsel threatened to resign.And an honor guard was giving Mr. Trump a royal salute at Windsor Castle in July when his deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.For Mr. Trump, who is particularly concerned with winning news cycles, the summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, that begins Wednesday is a major opportunity to change the subject from his losing fight with Democrats over funding for a wall along the southwestern border.But at 10 p.m. that day in Hanoi, the counternarrative will begin when Mr. Cohen starts his testimony before the House Oversight Committee about Mr. Trump’s alleged payoffs, financial disclosures, compliance with campaign finance laws and business matters. He is also expected to deliver raw, personal stories of his 10 years serving Mr. Trump.And this time, coverage of Mr. Trump’s trip abroad is not threatened to be subsumed by news reports, or by the findings of his own Justice Department, but by a Democrat-dominated congressional committee.ImageMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, will testify this week before Congress.CreditStephanie Keith for The New York TimesWhite House officials said House Democrats were deliberately trying to step on the summit meeting. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, said the overlapping events were no coincidence. “After all, they are politicians,” he said in a text.A spokesman for the committee chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether the scheduling of the hearing on the same day as the meeting was done intentionally.But Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, said the timing was unintentional. “These dates were developed over a long period of time, with lots of stops and starts and delays,” Mr. Davis said. “We had to worry about being attacked with Trump tweets. Trump set up the first reason for the delay.”The overlapping events, he added, were “the inevitable result of having chaos every day.”And, in fact, Mr. Cohen’s testimony was rescheduled, after he postponed it twice.White House officials played down any anxiety that Mr. Cohen’s testimony would steal the spotlight from Mr. Trump. One senior administration official described Mr. Cohen as a “convicted criminal who has already lied to Congress” and said that the clear headliner of the day would be a president who is “trying to undo 70 years of war and neglect.”There is also the question of which news outlets will interrupt coverage of the meeting between the president and Mr. Kim for Mr. Cohen’s hearing. Fox News has already touted an exclusive post-meeting interview with Mr. Trump, conducted by Sean Hannity, the cable news host, as part of its extensive coverage of the event.Other current and former White House officials said they saw a silver lining: The president tends to spend less time on Twitter when he is busy overseas, where he is less consumed by any developments pertaining to the open investigations. Mr. Cohen’s testimony, which might have had Mr. Trump glued to his television in the dining room off the Oval Office if he were home, they said, could pack less punch if he is busy with Mr. Kim.Still, even people who are not natural supporters of Mr. Trump said the timing of Mr. Cohen’s hearing was unfortunate, whether it was avoidable or not. “It’s not a desirable thing that the president goes abroad and, while he’s having an international summit, his former lawyer is testifying about the alleged crimes he’s committed,” said Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of Lawfare, and a friend of Mr. Comey’s.The pattern, some critics of the president said, is simply a product of the number of investigations involving Mr. Trump, which have overshadowed his work both at home and abroad.“When your campaign, your transition, your charity, your business, your White House and your inaugural committee are all under investigation, there are going to be a lot of new developments,” said Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Obama Justice Department.For now, the White House is trying to shrug off the overlap.“I don’t think the president has any concerns whatsoever about Michael Cohen,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week on “Fox & Friends.” “I think Michael Cohen may need to be concerned for himself, but that’s certainly something that’s not influencing or bothering us in this building.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Stay Tuned for a Split Screen Between Vietnam and Washington.

Our team of Washington reporters uncovered a secretive layer of President Trump’s public war on the investigations encircling him, particularly that of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.They interviewed dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump and reviewed confidential White House documents, finding numerous unreported episodes of pressure and intimidation over the last two years that may expose him to accusations of obstruction of justice.Their published report, at 4,500 words, is our most-read article today.Separately, House Democrats are investigating an administration effort to bring nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia despite repeated warnings that potential conflicts of interest around the plan could put U.S. security at risk._____ImageCreditGuillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images2. Sixteen states have banded together to challenge President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the border, setting up a constitutional clash over the scope of presidential emergency powers.Their lawsuit argues that the president doesn’t have the power to divert federal funds to build his promised border wall because Congress controls spending. House Democrats are also gearing up to confront the president.

Bernie Sanders makes 12.The Vermont senator announced his 2020 presidential campaign, a bid that will test whether he can retain the anti-establishment appeal he enjoyed with liberal voters in 2016. A self-styled democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders believes his policy ideas now have support from many more Americans, including Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free public colleges.

American teachers have mounted the most sustained educator protest movement in decades — and it doesn’t show any signs of stopping.Teachers walked out of classrooms again in West Virginia on Tuesday, above, helping to kill a bill that would have allowed tax dollars to pay for private school tuition and established charter schools in the state for the first time.

The Roman Catholic Church confirmed that it has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and end up fathering children, a growing issue that strikes at the heart of the Vatican’s culture of secrecy.It appears to be the first admission that such a practice existed. The children are often a result of affairs, though some are the product of rape or abuse. Above, Vincent Doyle, the son of a priest.Some of these children are among those descending on Rome to press their cause during the Vatican’s unprecedented meeting this week on the child sexual abuse crisis.Separately, Southern Baptists announced plans to address sexual abuse in the wake of an investigation by The Houston Chronicle and The San Antonio Express-News. The reporting revealed that nearly 400 Southern Baptist leaders had been accused of sexual misconduct or crimes against more than 700 victims since 1998._____ImageCreditCorey Olsen for The New York Times7. What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of its biggest stars?It’s a question vexing the platform as it tries to rein in bad actors with a new recommendation algorithm. Instead of aiming to maximize the amount of time users spend on the site — rewarding those who traded in viral stunts and baseless rumor-mongering — the company says it is trying to reduce the spread of “borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.”And harmful, our tech and culture columnist notes, is a circular notion: “A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.”_____ImageCreditBill Cunningham/The New York Times8. “Sweatpants are a sign of defeat.”That was the witty, highly recognizable Karl Lagerfeld, the most prolific designer of the 20th and 21st centuries. He died in Paris at the age of 85, after a career that reshaped the fashion industry.As the creative director at Chanel since 1983 and Fendi since 1965, Mr. Lagerfeld, above in 2002, achieved an unparalleled level of fame.

Our Opinion section has been looking at how the events of 1919 shaped the modern era.Consider jazz: A century ago, many in the U.S. considered it no more than a novelty. But then the famed Harlem Hellfighters 369th Infantry regiment marched through Manhattan during celebrations over the end of World War I. All ears were on its band, above.Led by Lt. James Reese Europe, an immensely successful and well-known African-American musician, the band — and its renown abroad — surfaced in nearly every account of the parade, writes David Sager, a research assistant at the Library of Congress, jazz historian and jazz trombonist.Between that and a young cornetist named Louis Armstrong, he argues, 1919 “was the year jazz came into its own.”_____ImageCreditSebastian Modak/The New York Times10.

So, President Trump’s announcement on Friday that he was declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico was a natural fit for “Saturday Night Live.”This weekend’s “S.N.L.” broadcast, hosted by Don Cheadle and featuring the musical guest Gary Clark Jr., opened with Alec Baldwin in one of his increasingly infrequent appearances as President Trump.Striding out to face reporters in the Rose Garden, Baldwin said, “I’m here to declare a very urgent, important national emergency. This is a big one, so I don’t want to waste any time. That’s why first I’d like to blow my own horn a little bit.”Trump Press Conference Cold Open - SNLCreditCreditSaturday Night LiveHe referenced his recent health exam — “I’m still standing six-foot-seven, 185 pounds, shredded” — and an upcoming summit in Hanoi with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, “who by the way is a very cool, misunderstood guy.”Then, Baldwin said, “Let’s cut to the chase, folks. We need wall. We have a tremendous amount of drugs flowing into this country from the southern border, or the Brown Line as many people have asked me not to call it.”“Wall works,” Baldwin said. “Wall makes safe.” He said that you don’t have to be smart to understand that, “and in fact it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he added.“So you can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right?” Baldwin asked. “I have to because I want to.”Imitating a portion of the speech in which the president assessed his legal prospects in a strange singsong voice, Baldwin said:And the ruling will not go in my favor. And then it’ll end up in the Supreme Court. And then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh. And I’ll say, it’s time to repay the Donny. And he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’ And then the Mueller report will be released. Crumbling my house of cards. And I can just plead insanity.“And my personal hell of playing president will finally be over,” Baldwin said.He then introduced the newly confirmed attorney general, William P. Barr (played by Beck Bennett), noting, “This guy’s going to do such a great job. But still, he’s working for me so I give him three months, tops. Dead man walking right there.”Baldwin went on to take questions from reporters, including one played by Heidi Gardner, who asked him if, after two years into his term, he was still adjusting to the presidency.Baldwin replied, “Come on, doll, I’m learning. Let’s not forget, technically, this is my first real job.” He added, “Had I known then what I know now, I would have told Putin to just give the job to Hillary instead.”“In conclusion,” Baldwin said, “this is a total emergency, a five-alarm blaze. Which means I’ve got to go to Mar-a-Lago so I can play some golf.”Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on President Trump’s emergency declaration.Jost:President Trump declared a national emergency yesterday and said we needed a wall to stop the flow of drugs into our country. And to demonstrate how bad the drug problem is, Trump spent 20 minutes doing his impression of a coke addict. [A series of video clips from the news conference, ending with President Trump saying, “So, that’s the story”.] And what a beautiful story it was. Trump then described, in a singsong voice, how his declaration will face a lengthy legal challenge before he can actually act on it, saying this. [Video of the singsong portion of the speech.] [Jost singing] “Oh my God. That guy controls our nuclear weapons.” Watching that, it was like if “Schoolhouse Rock” had a stroke. By the way, you know what an actual national emergency is: the climate change that let the president give an outdoor press conference in the middle of February.Che:I’m so tired of telling Donald Trump jokes. We’ve been making fun of this dude and his dumbass wall for so long. I’ve got to be honest, now I kind of want to see the wall. I’ve never seen anybody so confident of such a bad idea. It’s almost charming, like when Colin thought he could pull off cornrows. I’m not saying that we should let him build the wall, but what if we just let him do a PowerPoint presentation or a dramatic re-enactment? I just want to see exactly what Trump thinks is going to happen when a Mexican cartel sees a wall. What do you think they’re going to do, just shake their fists and walk home? You know how motivated you’ve got to be to sell drugs? I know a guy that swallowed a bag of dope, pooped it out, washed it off and then still sold it. You can’t build a wall to stop that.Michael Che also joked about a recent report in The New York Times about the musician Ryan Adams, in which several women said he retaliated against them professionally when they turned down his sexual advances. One fan, now 20 years old, said that Adams shared sexually explicit messages with her while she was still a teenager.Che:The F.B.I. is investigating whether singer-songwriter Ryan Adams committed a crime by engaging with sexually explicit communications with a 14-year-old fan. Just another example of a white musician doing something a black musician did first. [Here, the screen displayed a picture of R. Kelly.]Weekend Update Deskside Bit of the WeekIn a visit from the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer (Alex Moffat), and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi (Kate McKinnon), the two Democratic officials tried not to celebrate excessively after Jost told them they’d bested President Trump in their recent negotiations with President Trump.Moffat asked, “What is there to gloat about? The president is a very tough negotiator.”McKinnon said, “We are devastated with the outcome.”“The truth is, Colin, the president ate our lunch,” Moffat said.“He did,” McKinnon agreed. “He ate his lunch. He ate all the lunches.”After stifling some laughter, McKinnon said, “The president really did whip our butts here.”“And that’s just one reason I’m siting on a hemorrhoid cushion right now,” Moffat said. Oscar Nominees of the Week“S.N.L.” brought back its recurring “Celebrity Family Feud” parody — and Kenan Thompson as its host, Steve Harvey — for a segment that pit two teams of nominees from next weekend’s Academy Awards against each other.The sketch was essentially a buffet of celebrity impersonations, including Spike Lee (Don Cheadle), Glenn Close (McKinnon), Sam Elliott (Beck Bennett), Olivia Colman (Cecily Strong), Lady Gaga (Melissa Villaseñor), Bradley Cooper (Kyle Mooney), Rami Malek (Pete Davidson) and Mahershala Ali (Chris Redd).It also benefited from Thompson’s banter with guests he could hardly pretend to be impressed by. Discussing the film “Green Book” with Redd, Thompson said, “I got a question about that last scene in your movie where the white guy teaches the black guy how to eat fried chicken.”Redd replied, “That wasn’t the last scene, Steve.”“It was for me,” Thompson said.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWhat’s Going On in This Graph? | Feb. 27, 2019 - The New York Times

This graph shows the length of daily delays on one woman’s 40-minute commute between Munich and a town in the German countryside during 2018. The graph originally appeared elsewhere on NYTimes.com.The commuter knitted two rows each day. Gray for delays under five minutes, pink for up to 30 minutes, and red for a delay of more than a half-hour or delays in both directions.After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), think about these three questions:• What do you notice?• What do you wonder?What are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graph?• What might be going on in this graph?Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea. If your headline makes a claim, tell us what you noticed that supports your claim.The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. Start with “I notice,” then “I wonder,” and end with “The story this graph is telling is ….” and a catchy headline.2.

This $8,650 Scarf Tells the Tale.” Read the article to learn more about the scarf graph’s story.Some of you asked how a scarf can be a graph. David of California wrote, “I noticed within the first few seconds that it’s a scarf and not digital. Which I find odd for you The New York Times, but new is cool.” David, actually the knitter Claudia Weber is the cool one. She made the scarf. Kalyn of New York responded by sharing how this striped scarf is a graph. “It’s measuring this woman’s commute times and delays.” Graphs use numerical data, like times. Ms. Weber could have represented the data as a bar graph or time series, but isn’t it more engaging as a scarf? So engaging that someone paid $8,650 for it on eBay. (Would they have paid less if the train were on time?)Data visualization (see below Stat Nugget) knitting is now a rage among statisticians and their friends, especially using climate change data. In 2015, the University of Georgia marine scientist Joan Sheldon translated temperature change data into a scarf. Using a simple color coding system, she knitted “graphs” based on published data. Now, the Tempestry Project sells kits with yarn and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data and there are Facebook groups and a website.Here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this graph: “Scarf Makes Train Look Bad” by SlickNinja of Baltimore and “Knitting Congestion Into Art” by McBride of Denver; and these three from New Hampshire — “Weaving Through Heavy Traffic” by Daniel and Nate, “Warming Up with Delays” by Nathaniel, and “Knitting Through the Rows of Traffic” by Greg.You may want to think critically about these additional questions.• Estimate the proportion of days in the year that the train was on time. When was the train most frequently on time? Explain your reasoning.• That big red bar — when did it happen and how many days or weeks was it? Explain how you arrived at your answers.• You can make your own “data viz” scarf or other creative data visualization. Find some data that interests you, such as the temperature or sporting events attendance, and then graph the data for a year or longer. After color coding the data, you can visualize it on graph paper, a knit scarf or anything else. Your classmates could pick the same data set or different ones. Either way, have a discussion by comparing what you notice and wonder from these graphs.• The knitting commuter sold the scarf on eBay and contributed the 7,550 euros ($8,650) to her favorite charity. The winning bid was made by the digital team of the Deutsche Bahn — the state rail operator of the knitter’s train. Estimate the amount the bidder paid for every minute late during the knitter’s commute. Explain how you arrived at this estimate, including how you dealt with the time ranges corresponding to the different colors.Below in the Stat Nuggets, we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to this graph. Look into the archives to see past Stat Nuggets.Thank you for participating in “What’s Going On in This Graph?”, which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Data visualizations, like these graphs, are an important part of statistics. They help us to understand and learn from data.Keep noticing and wondering. We continue to welcome your responses.Join us Wednesday, March 6 to notice and wonder about vaping.

This $8,650 Scarf Tells the Tale”STACKED BAR GRAPH & TIME SERIES GRAPHA stacked bar graph summarizes values from a categorical data set. From the graph, the proportion of the time that each value occurred can be compared.A time series graph shows how the values from a quantitative variable change over time.The commuter delay scarf graph is neither a stacked bar graph nor a time series, but incorporates aspects of each.It is not a stacked bar graph because the three categories (delays of less than 5 minutes, delays of 5 - 30 minutes, and delays of more than 30 minutes or in both directions) are not grouped together but are distributed on a timeline.It is not a time series graph because the variable is not quantitative. It is categorical: delays that are short (less than 5 minutes), medium (5 to 30 minute), and long (more than 30 minutes or in both directions.)DATA VISUALIZATION or DATA VIZData visualization is a means to represent data with graphs, infographics and other visual representations. Statisticians, computer scientists and graphic artists in the “data viz” field have the goal to clearly and efficiently communicate the story behind the data.The commuter delay scarf graph is a data visualization representing data on daily commuter delays into knitted rows on a scarf, and it has become a media star among “data viz” aficionados._________The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney, a mathematics teacher in Boston. Ms. Hessney wrote the “reveal” and Stat Nuggets with Roxy Peck, professor emerita at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, and moderated online with Jennifer Mueller, a mathematics teacher at Parkway North High School in St. Louis.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsXinjiang, Labour Party, Venezuela: Your Friday Briefing - The New York Times

By Penn BullockFeb. 21, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. China builds a database of Uighurs’ DNA, an ex-spy chief turns on Venezuela’s president and a fire in Bangladesh fits a disturbing pattern. Here’s the latest: ImageTahir Imin, a Uighur, had his blood drawn and face scanned by the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang.CreditKate Warren for The New York TimesChina uses DNA to track Uighurs, aided by U.S. expertiseChina is collecting genetic material as part of a vast campaign of oppression against Muslim minority groups. Human rights groups and Uighur activists say the DNA could be used to chase down anyone who resists conforming.To help build out the DNA database, China used equipment from a U.S. company, Thermo Fisher, and got material from a prominent Yale geneticist for comparing Uighur DNA with genetic material from people around the world.How it unfolded: Under the guise of free medical checkups in the western region of Xinjiang, where much of the population is Uighur, the government collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data of tens of millions of people.In some cases, people were told the checkups were mandatory.Background: In 2016, the government set out to make Uighurs and other minority groups more subservient to the Communist Party, detaining up to a million people in what it calls “re-education” camps. The response: Thermo Fisher said it would stop selling equipment in Xinjiang. And the Yale researcher said he had believed that the Chinese authorities were operating within scientific norms that require the informed consent of DNA donors.ImageLabour Party defectors during a press conference on Wednesday in London.CreditAndy Rain/EPA, via ShutterstockU.K. Labour Party grapples with accusations of anti-SemitismWavertree — a tiny, multiethnic, mostly working-class constituency in Liverpool, England — is at the center of a national row over whether anti-Semitism is rife in the Labour Party. Luciana Berger, the member of Parliament for the area, resigned this week after local Labour activists called her a “disruptive Zionist” and a supporter of a “murdering” Israeli government.She is one of eight Labour defectors who quit in protest of their left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, criticizing his ambiguity over Britain’s exit from the European Union and accusing him of tolerating anti-Semitism in the party. Details: Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said that the party is investigating the Wavertree branch. Bigger picture: Mr. Corbyn’s supporters, many of them Jewish, deny that he has brooked prejudice, arguing that instances of anti-Semitism in the party have fallen since he became leader and that criticizing the Israeli government, as Mr. Corbyn does unapologetically, does not equate to a hatred of Jews. Critics say there is anti-Semitism under the surface, as when a Labour lawmaker suggested that the defectors might have had financial backing from Israel.ImageHugo Carvajal, a former spy chief in Venezuela, declared his support for the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.CreditFernando Llano/Associated PressA former Venezuelan official turns on MaduroA former Venezuelan intelligence chief called President Nicolás Maduro a dictator with a corrupt inner circle, one of the most public rejections to date.In interviews with The Times, the former spy chief, Hugo Carvajal, urged the military to break with Mr. Maduro ahead of a showdown with the opposition on Saturday, when tons of aid from the U.S. and other countries is slated to arrive. U.S. investigators have accused Mr. Carvajal of drug trafficking. In interviews, he denied those claims, but depicted other senior Venezuelan officials as a criminal claque in league with drug traffickers. Other developments: To thwart aid shipments, Mr. Maduro ordered the closing of Venezuela’s border with Brazil, having already blocked air and sea traffic from three Caribbean islands. ImageMembers of Ending Clergy Abuse, a global activist organization for victims of sexual abuse, held a protest in Rome on Thursday.CreditAlberto Pizzoli/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesVatican begins conference on clerical sexual abusePope Francis, his moral authority in question and his papal legacy in the balance, opened a historic four-day conference at the Vatican to address child sexual abuse in the church. “We hear the cry of the little ones,” he said.Before 190 church leaders, he called for “concrete and effective measures” to address clerical sexual abuse. Victims are putting enormous pressure on the Vatican to take action on an issue that in some parts of the world has eroded trust in the Roman Catholic Church while being ignored and denied in others. Other issues: The conference is shadowed by a series of fresh scandals: the sexual abuse of nuns, the shaming and closeting of gay priests, and revelations that the church has secret guidelines for dealing with priests who father children.

Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser — worked with retired military officers to circumvent the normal policymaking process to promote an export plan that experts worried could spread nuclear weapons technology in the volatile Middle East. Administration lawyers warned that the nuclear exports plan — called the Middle East Marshall Plan — could violate laws meant to stop nuclear proliferation and raised concerns about Mr. Flynn’s conflicts of interest.Mr. Flynn had worked on the issue for the company promoting the nuclear export plan and kept pushing it once inside the White House.But even after Mr. Flynn was fired, the proposal appears to have lingered. The initial discussions took place during the chaotic early months of the Trump administration, according to the 24-page report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, but House Democrats on Tuesday cited evidence that as recently as last week the White House was still considering some version of the proposal. Democrats said they had begun a full-scale inquiry.“Further investigation is needed to determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump administration are in the national security interest of the United States or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially as a result of this potential change in U.S. foreign policy,” committee staff wrote in the report.The Trump administration’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has already been examined by federal investigators, including the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But House Democrats could expand the inquiry into whether the prospect of business deals might have had a direct effect on American foreign policy in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region.In this case, it was American nuclear energy companies and the retired generals and other former government officials working with them who stood to benefit financially if the federal government signed off on IP3’s proposal for building of the nuclear power sites.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Flynn did not respond to a message seeking comment.Claims presented by whistle-blowers and White House documents obtained by the House oversight committee show that the company backing the nuclear plan, IP3 International, was working so closely with allies in the Trump political world that the company sent draft memos that would be needed from the president for the nuclear export plan to Mr. Flynn just days after Mr. Trump took office.A week after Inauguration Day, the Democrats’ report said, a Flynn deputy for Middle East and North African affairs, Derek Harvey, met with the IP3’s co-founders at the White House, and asked National Security Council staff to include information about the nuclear power plan in a briefing to prepare Mr. Trump for a call with King Salman of Saudi Arabia.The speed with which Mr. Harvey acted, and his circumvention of the normal scrutiny by experts across the government — like officials in the Energy and State Departments — prompted at least some National Security Council officials to raise concerns with Mr. Harvey, the report said. Eventually, ethics lawyers also raised concerns.Even after Mr. Flynn left the White House in February 2017 under scrutiny by the F.B.I. for his communications with Russia, officials on the National Security Council continued to push ahead, repeatedly ignoring advice from the council’s ethics counsel, the report said.At a March 2017 meeting, Mr. Harvey tried to revive the IP3 plan “so that Jared Kushner can present it to the president for approval,” the Democratic report said, a reference to Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser. Eventually Mr. Flynn’s successor, H. R. McMaster, said all work on the plan should cease because of potentially illegal conflicts.The draft memos sent by IP3 to Mr. Flynn also referenced another close Trump associate, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a businessman with deep ties to the Middle East who served as chairman of the president’s inaugural committee. In one memo from Mr. Flynn to Mr. Trump, the national security adviser advocated that Mr. Barrack be named a special representative to carry out the nuclear plan. Another memo, written as if it was from Mr. Trump to cabinet secretaries and other military and intelligence officials, directed federal agencies to support Mr. Barrack’s efforts.The Democrats’ investigation comes at a sensitive time, when lawmakers of both parties are incensed over the Trump administration’s reluctance to punish Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi government over the killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As supporters of the nuclear deal maneuvered in the opening days of the Trump White House, Mr. Kushner was orchestrating what would be Mr. Trump’s first overseas trip as president, to Saudi Arabia, and met on his own with the deputy crown prince at the time, Mr. bin Salman, before the prince became the power behind the Saudi throne.Mr. Kushner’s efforts continue. He is scheduled to travel to the region next week, with a stop in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to brief diplomats on the economic portions of the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan.The special counsel’s investigation has spent months examining contacts between Trump advisers and both officials and informal emissaries from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Prosecutors have been trying to determine whether the gulf monarchies might have spent money to try to influence Mr. Trump’s political activities, including his 2016 presidential campaign.Prosecutors at one point were particularly focused on what business interests might have been discussed in meetings leading up to the 2017 Riyadh summit meeting, according to people familiar with the witness interviews.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, raised alarms on the nuclear exports in 2017 when he disclosed claims brought to him by a whistle-blower. But the committee’s Republican chairman at the time did nothing.So on Tuesday, Mr. Cummings, now the committee’s chairman, said he would do the work himself.Republicans on the committee did not receive a copy of the report until last night and had not fully assessed it, according to their spokeswoman, Charli Huddleston.“This is a delicate and nuanced issue that Chairman Cummings is approaching without bipartisan input and with far-flung requests for information,” she said.In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Barrack said that he would cooperate with Mr. Cummings’s investigation and noted he had never taken a job in the administration.In an unsigned statement, IP3 said that it would cooperate with Mr. Cummings’s inquiry and that Mr. Flynn had no financial stake in the company. It defended its plan at length, framing it as a matter of “vital national security interest” for the United States to compete with foreign competitors like Russia and China who are seeking to grow their influence in the region.“Only the United States nuclear industry can deliver the standard of safety, security, regulatory oversight and operational primacy required to ensure both the nonproliferation goals as well as the strategic goals of the United States are achieved,” the statement said. “Achieving these goals will require close coordination between the U.S. government and industry.”Jack Langer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Harvey now works, called the details about him “a ridiculous conspiracy theory.”The export of American nuclear technology that could be used to create nuclear weapons is strictly controlled under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The act says that Congress must approve such exports, and at least one of the whistle-blowers that went to the Democrats claimed that officials involved ignored warnings about such legal requirements.A plan like the one advocated by IP3 International has not gone forward to date. But Mr. Cummings’s staff said there was evidence that the White House was still kicking around the proposal.Mr. Trump met with nuclear industry executives at the White House last week to discuss expanding their presence internationally, including in the Middle East. Bloomberg reported that the session was organized by Jack Keane, a retired four-star Army general and one of the founders of IP3 International.The IP3 project was the second nuclear power plan that Mr. Flynn had worked on, according to people involved in the projects. During 2015 and 2016, after he retired from the military, Mr. Flynn had consulted with and traveled to the Middle East on behalf of ACU Strategic Partners, which was pursuing an ambitious plan that envisioned Russia taking spent nuclear fuel to avoid the danger of nuclear proliferation.Some of the retired generals who advised the ACU Strategic Partners effort subsequently broke off and created IP3, which for a time argued for replacing Russia with China in the nuclear power plan.Scott Shane and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with the abrupt end of the summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, Michael Cohen’s dramatic testimony in Congress, and a look at the conflict in Kashmir.ImageNorth Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, today.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesU.S.-North Korea talks collapsePresident Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, cut short their summit meeting today in Hanoi, Vietnam, after the two sides failed to agree on even the first steps for nuclear disarmament, a peace declaration for the Korean War or a reduction in sanctions on the North.At a news conference after the talks ended, Mr. Trump said, “It was about the sanctions.” He said that Mr. Kim wanted economic penalties fully lifted in exchange for dismantling some — but not all — of the North’s nuclear weapons program. Here are the latest updates.Related: Mr. Trump was also asked about the congressional testimony on Wednesday by his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. “He lied a lot,” Mr. Trump said.ImageMichael Cohen was sworn in before about five hours of nationally televised testimony.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesCohen accuses Trump of lies and cover-upsMichael Cohen, who represented President Trump for more than a decade, offered a damning portrait of his former employer during a hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday.Mr. Cohen accused Mr. Trump of lying to the public about business interests in Russia, of lying to reporters about stolen Democratic emails, and of telling Mr. Cohen to lie about hush payments to cover up sexual misconduct. Mr. Cohen said he had no “direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia,” but added, “I have my suspicions.” Here are five takeaways from his testimony.Response: Republicans denounced both Mr. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying under oath to Congress, and the Democratic-led hearing, which they called a “charade” and an “embarrassment for our country.”Watch: We have video highlights of Mr. Cohen’s testimony. Our journalists also provided real-time commentary.The Daily: In today’s episode, Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent, discusses the hearing.The nasty breakup of a long relationshipMichael Cohen said on Wednesday that President Trump remained deeply involved in the payment of hush money to a pornographic film actress, even while in the White House. Mr. Cohen also implicated Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization in the arrangement. “Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong,” Mr. Cohen said. We looked at the history between the two men.News analysis: Mr. Cohen’s testimony represents a test for both political parties, one of our White House correspondents writes. Democrats will face calls to impeach Mr. Trump, and Republicans will have to decide how much to support him.Pakistan offers to return Indian pilotPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan said today that a captured Indian pilot would soon be released to de-escalate tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors.India did not immediately respond to Thursday’s announcement.

That marks a slowdown from the middle of 2018, when growth briefly exceeded 4 percent.Gun control bill: The House voted Wednesday to require background checks for all gun buyers, the first major gun control bill to pass the chamber in 25 years. The Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the measure.Correction in Manafort file: The special counsel’s office has revised its account of the evidence it used in asserting that Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, breached his plea deal. It’s a rare admission of a mistake by Robert Mueller’s prosecutors.Canada’s political crisis: A former cabinet minister and attorney general has testified that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff used “political interference” and “veiled threats” to try to stop her from pursuing a criminal case.Possible war crimes: Israeli troops may have violated international law by firing on Palestinians during mass protests at the Gaza border last year, United Nations investigators said today.Pressure on Israeli leader: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be indicted today in any of three corruption cases.

Modern Love Wants to Hear From YouOur college essay contest is back. Here’s what we’re looking for.ImageCreditCreditIllustration by Brian ReaBy Robbie HarmsFeb. 27, 2019Welcome to The Edit. Each week in our newsletter, you’ll hear from college students and recent graduates about issues going on in their lives. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Another Valentine’s Day has passed, which means it’s a good time to 1) buy candy and 2) start writing, because the Modern Love College Essay Contest is officially open for submissions.If you are a frequent reader of the column or listener of the podcast, you know that Modern Love is home to some of the most moving personal essays in The Times. Now, college students, is your chance to submit your own story.I talked to Daniel Jones and Miya Lee of the Modern Love team about what they’re looking for in submissions, common themes of young love and college students’ inevitable procrastination.Robbie: How did the contest originate?Daniel Jones: I wasn’t hearing from young writers, and I wanted to get great essays that would really define what relationships were for people that age. I put out a call for a contest and aggressively publicized it through emailing English departments nationwide and all that. It really paid off. I loved the material that came in and seeing the trends of what young people were dealing with.Robbie: Is holding it in mid-February purely coincidental or is that a conscious decision because of Valentine’s Day?Daniel: We had to find a time that was after winter break that would give enough time for students to write essays — they get five weeks or so — then for us to read all of them, edit and publish them while school is still in session. We time the announcement to Valentine’s Day because love is in the air, supposedly.Robbie: What are you looking for in submissions?Miya: We’re looking for essays that are representative of the bunch but also have a unique voice. We try to pay attention to trends when we’re reading. One year there were many essays about Tinder, so we wanted to make sure one of the finalists hit on using apps for dating.Daniel: And we’re always looking for strong storytelling. A lot of students get the misimpression that we’re looking for an essay that defines what love is. They’ll start off with a dictionary definition and write five paragraphs. But it’s not an expository essay; it’s a narrative essay. It’s storytelling from their lives that makes a point about relationships today. It should convey that information through storytelling, not through argument.Robbie: What common themes or trends have you noticed about millennial love?Daniel: I’d say the most common overall theme is people trying to figure out how to find love without ever having to be vulnerable. I often get the sense that college students are piecing together the little parts of their love lives that they need. There can be sort of a dividing line between an emotional relationship and a physical relationship. It changes from year to year based on how people are communicating and where they’re finding these connections.Miya: There are many more forms of relationships now. Polyamory is a big theme in this contest, and I don’t really remember it showing up as much in the 2015 contest.Daniel: It seems like many young people are getting rid of old constrictions, but they aren’t sure what shape the new thing should take. There’s lots of discussion about labels and terminology. In a previous contest, so many essays were asking the question, “What are we? Is this a relationship? Is it not a relationship? Does it have a rule? Does it not have a rule?” There’s always a lot about college that’s experimental, and that’s good! It leaves a lot of room for confusion, but it also leaves a lot of room for good essay writing because people are trying to figure out what things are.Robbie: Sometimes I feel like I need a dictionary to distinguish between all of the different terms we have for things, whether it’s “talking” or “hooking up” or “ghosting.”Daniel: I remember reading a bunch of essays, I can’t remember how long ago it was, where no one really agreed on what “hooking up” was. They sort of assumed they had this language in common, but when they were really being honest they were like, “Is this hooking up? If you’re just like kissing, is that hooking up?”Miya: We’ve also seen a lot of people talking about the impact of technology. Clara Dollar, who was a finalist in the last competition, wrote about her Instagram personality and how she was always trying to live up to that version of herself. In 2015, Davis Webster wrote about never meeting up with someone on Tinder, but having this kind of virtual relationship. So at one end of the spectrum you have this no-strings-attached hookup culture, and then on the other side you have people connecting emotionally in a virtual world, but never meeting up.Daniel: It can be really hard to start over and reinvent yourself in college the way that many people used to because now your whole online presence trails along. Your followers are going to notice if you start to become a new person. There’s a self-consciousness about that. It also used to be that a lot of high school relationships would end when you went to college — that was it, you weren’t going to have a long-distance thing. Now a lot of people just transition seamlessly into long-distance laptop/phone relationships and often never question that they shouldn’t.Robbie: What is the reading and judging process like? I read last time you all met up at the Seinfeld diner in New York.Daniel: Most of it’s not that fun or glamorous. Much like reading for the regular column, which I’ve been doing for 14 years and Miya has been doing for four years, it’s really about immersing yourself in essay after essay and figuring out how much you need to read to give it a fair chance.With the college contest we’re looking at 2,000 or more submissions, which we have to get through in about three weeks. With such a huge workload, we’re looking for some spark. It doesn’t have to be a perfectly polished essay, but there has to be some vulnerability and an idea that we can grasp on to. We publish the winner and then if we have other good finalists, we’ll publish as many as five essays. So we’re also looking for a mix that can represent a breadth of experience. We wouldn’t run four essays that are all about Tinder, for example; we’d want to run essays that show different things.Often writers are good at what they’re good at because they have distance from the subject matter, and they’re writing about something that they’ve been able to process for five years, or seven years, or 10 years. What’s so remarkable about the college contest is that students are writing about the time they’re in right now with that kind of intelligence and self-awareness. That’s what I appreciate the most and what I feel like I was not even close to in college.Robbie: How does reading all of these deep personal essays in such a short time period affect you emotionally?Daniel: Part of it’s exhausting, but it’s also really inspiring. Some students aren’t able to articulate what they’re going through well enough for publication, but it’s impactful to read the things they’re grappling with, which are often really traumatic experiences. You can see them figuring things out about these really difficult experiences and coming out the other side of that through writing. That’s always inspiring to me.Robbie: Anything else?Daniel: Something like 80 percent of the submissions come in on the final day. Of that 80 percent, I think like 60 percent come in in the final two hours. College students and deadlines — it’s kind of hilarious. Maybe try to get it in before 11:58.What We’re Reading21 Savage on ICE Detention, the Grammys and His Uncertain Future “My situation is important ’cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans,” the rapper said.YouTube Unleashed a Conspiracy Theory Boom.

Después de que el multimillonario Richard Branson dijera que planeaba realizar un concierto de ayuda para Venezuela, el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro anunció que también organizará eventos musicales. Estas presentaciones aumentan la tensión en la frontera y quizá tengan implicaciones significativas para el futuro de Venezuela, donde dos hombres se disputan la presidencia.En el lado venezolano hay soldados, milicianos y misiles enviados por las fuerzas leales a Maduro, cuya legitimidad fue desafiada en enero cuando el líder de la oposición, Juan Guaidó, se declaró presidente encargado en medio de grandes manifestaciones contra el gobierno.Del lado colombiano hay camarógrafos de medios recién llegados y camiones llenos de suministros. Sin embargo, Guaidó y otros líderes de la oposición no han explicado cómo ingresará la ayuda a Venezuela, pues han dicho que compartir sus planes implicaría un riesgo de seguridad. Guaidó dijo el lunes que la decisión de Maduro de organizar un evento rival lo hacía ver “desesperado”.• Perú retoma zona deforestada por la minería ilegal de oro. El gobierno peruano desplegó el martes más de mil agentes y soldados en La Pampa, una especie de ciudad clandestina de unas 10.000 hectáreas donde laboran miles de mineros ilegales en el departamento Madre de Dios. Esa región amazónica es conocida mundialmente por su biodiversidad, pero desde hace una década fue tomada por buscadores de oro que han destrozado los bosques y han convertido miles de hectáreas en zonas desérticas bajo el dominio del crimen organizado.• Ecuador creará una comisión de expertos para lucha contra la corrupción. El objetivo del grupo, que realizará su trabajo hasta que concluya la gestión del presidente Lenín Moreno en 2021, será apoyar a las instituciones estatales en la detección, investigación y judicialización de actos de corrupción; además, buscará mecanismos de reparación para el Estado.“Nuestro desafío como Ecuador será constituir un grupo de expertos internacionales que nos permita luchar contra la impunidad. Creemos que la institucionalidad en los diez años pasados tuvo su debilitamiento por falta de autonomía e independencia”, dijo el secretario Anticorrupción, Iván Granda, en un encuentro con periodistas.Opinión: Virginia López Glass“El colapso económico de Venezuela se está convirtiendo rápidamente en un conflicto internacional. La incapacidad de Maduro de resolver una crisis económica con escasez desenfrenada de alimentos y medicinas ha provocado una crisis humanitaria”.La periodista Virginia López Glass reflexiona sobre la grave crisis económica venezolana y se centra en el proceso inflacionario que acaba con el poder adquisitivo de los salarios, además de convertir a la compra de alimentos en una agotadora prioridad debido a las largas filas provocadas por el permanente desabastecimiento de los productos básicos.Una instantánea: Postales del planeta rojoImageEn el sentido de las agujas del reloj: Parte del cráter Endeavour; los rastros de Opportunity por la arena; una planicie avistada en 2011, y el cráter de Santa MaríaCreditNASA/JplEl robot explorador Opportunity de la NASA tomó más de 21.000 fotografías durante los catorce años en los que viajó por Marte. Varias de esas imágenes muestran panoramas de 360 grados del paisaje rojizo; otras son acercamientos microscópicos de rocas. Gracias a esas fotografías, los científicos de la misión pudieron estudiar la historia geológica de ese planeta.En el mundoImage“Es el próximo escándalo”, dijo Vincent Doyle, hijo de un sacerdote. “Hay hijos de sacerdotes en todas partes”.CreditSuzanne Kreiter/Boston Globe vía Getty Images• Las reglas secretas del Vaticano para los sacerdotes con hijos. La congregación que supervisa a los sacerdotes católicos en el mundo confirmó que cuenta con directrices para aquellos que tienen hijos por distintas causas (incluso por violación). En la reunión mundial de obispos de esta semana, los hijos de sacerdotes exigirán respuestas. “Puedo confirmar que existen esos lineamientos”, escribió Alessandro Gisotti, portavoz del Vaticano, en respuesta a una solicitud de The New York Times. “Es un documento interno”.• Los jerarcas homosexuales de la Iglesia católica. Sodoma, el nuevo libro del periodista francés Frédéric Martel, promete ser una bomba para el pontificado del papa Francisco. En él se afirma que aproximadamente el 80 por ciento de los miembros del clero que trabajan en el Vaticano, cerca del papa, son homosexuales.El volumen —que será lanzado en ocho idiomas y en veinte países el jueves 21 de febrero, el mismo día en que comienza la reunión mundial de obispos— sostiene que a mayor homofobia explícita de un funcionario del Vaticano, hay mayores probabilidades de que pertenezca a ese grupo y que, mientras más se escale en la cadena de mando, más homosexuales se encontrarán.ImageEl presidente Donald Trump a su llegada al congreso estadounidense para pronunciar su informe de gobierno, este mesCreditDoug Mills/The New York Times• La guerra pública de Donald Trump contra las investigaciones que rodean su presidencia ha durado lo suficiente como para que ya no sea impactante. Casi a diario, Trump se enfurece y les dice a sus 58 millones de seguidores en Twitter que el fiscal Robert Mueller está en una “cacería de brujas” y ha adoptado el lenguaje de los jefes de la mafia al llamar “ratas” a quienes cooperan con los abogados. Los aliados del presidente en el congreso estadounidense y los medios de comunicación conservadores advierten sobre un supuesto complot dentro del Departamento de Justicia y el FBI para subvertir a un presidente que fue elegido democráticamente.Un análisis realizado por The New York Times [en inglés] revela la magnitud del ataque sostenido —y secreto— que Trump ha ejecutado en contra del sistema federal de justicia. Una serie de entrevistas con docenas de funcionarios gubernamentales (actuales y anteriores) y otras personas cercanas a la presidencia, así como la revisión de documentos confidenciales de la Casa Blanca, revelan numerosos episodios que no han sido divulgados durante este mandato.Enigmas de la naturaleza• Un cardenal muy especial: mitad macho, mitad hembra. El ave que Shirley y Jeffrey Caldwell han visto afuera de su casa durante los últimos días es el ejemplar más extraño que hayan observado. Se trata de un cardenal que tiene en el lado izquierdo la sombra marrón de las hembras, y, en el derecho, el escarlata distintivo de los machos.Los investigadores creen que el cardenal que frecuenta el comedero para aves de los Caldwell en Erie, Pensilvania, es un extraño ginandromorfo bilateral, mitad macho y mitad hembra. No se sabe mucho sobre este fenómeno atípico, pero esta división sexual se ha reportado en aves, reptiles, mariposas y crustáceos.• Los secretos de la leche animal. Últimamente, los investigadores han encontrado equivalentes de la leche humana materna en una variedad inesperada de animales carentes de mamas como las arañas, las cucarachas y los escarabajos enterradores; también en tiburones blancos, pingüinos emperador machos y flamencos de ambos sexos.“Es probable que la primera función de la leche fuera hidratar los huevos de cascarón flexible que se ponían sobre tierra seca”, señaló Amy Skibiel, experta en lactancia de mamíferos de la Universidad de Idaho. Según esa hipótesis, los premamíferos regaban líquido sobre los huevos a través de los poros del pecho; los pezones aparecieron mucho después.Gracias por leernos.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexBriefingSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperBriefing|North Carolina, Jussie Smollett, Peter Tork: Your Friday BriefingAdvertisementSupported byNorth Carolina, Jussie Smollett, Peter Tork: Your Friday BriefingBy Chris StanfordFeb. 22, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with a new vote in a House race in North Carolina, a high-profile defection from Venezuela’s government, and a look at the benefits and challenges of the Green New Deal.ImageAt a hearing in Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday, Mark Harris, the Republican candidate, said, “a new election is warranted.”CreditPool photo by Travis LongNew election is ordered in North CarolinaA unanimous ruling by the state’s Board of Elections on Thursday means there will be another vote in the last undecided House race after last year’s midterm elections.The Republican candidate in the Ninth District, Mark Harris, asked for the new vote after testimony that his campaign had financed an illegal voter-turnout effort.The details: Mr. Harris had a 905-vote lead over his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, but regulators were alarmed that Mr. Harris won 61 percent of absentee ballots in a county where Republicans accounted for just 19 percent of them.What’s next: The Ninth District, which includes part of Charlotte, will go unrepresented in Congress for at least several months. It was unclear whether Mr. Harris would run in the new election, which has not been scheduled.Go deeper: This week’s testimony illuminated the inner workings of a precise but amateurish operation that paid workers to collect absentee ballots.ImageAlejandra Urquiola held her baby as her partner comforted their 1-year-old son in the emergency room of Central Hospital in San Cristóbal, Venezuela.CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesA top-level break with Venezuela’s leaderThe country’s former intelligence chief, who is one of the government’s most prominent figures, turned against President Nicolás Maduro on Thursday, calling him a dictator with a corrupt inner circle of followers.Hugo Carvajal, who retired from Venezuela’s intelligence service in 2012, also urged the military to abandon Mr. Maduro before a showdown with the opposition this weekend over the president’s blockade of humanitarian aid.Related: To thwart the shipments, Mr. Maduro ordered the closing of Venezuela’s border with Brazil on Thursday, having already blocked air and sea traffic from three Caribbean islands. Patients whose lives depend on aid fear the political standoff is obscuring their crisis.ImageRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal during a news conference this month.CreditPete Marovich for The New York TimesA plan both possible and problematicThe Green New Deal, a far-reaching proposal introduced by Democrats to tackle climate change and economic inequality, envisions creating millions of jobs by converting America’s energy infrastructure to supply 100 percent of the country’s electricity from renewable and zero-emissions sources.It’s technologically feasible, several experts have said, though perhaps not within the 10-year timescale the plan sets out. The bigger challenge is finding the money and political will.Reaction: Republicans have mocked the plan as a “socialist wish list.” Environmental activists have said its details and the hurdles it faces are less important than its ambition.Explainer: We answered nine questions about the Green New Deal, which you can read here.ImageThe plan for Cornell Tech on New York’s Roosevelt Island was hatched a decade ago.CreditHiroko Masuike/The New York TimesHow New York became a tech townAmazon’s sudden decision last week to abandon its plan for a campus in Queens is unlikely to stall New York City’s ascent in the technology sector.One of our business reporters traces how the city became a magnet for coders and tech companies, by luck and by design. “The main resource in technology is smart people,” said one longtime tech entrepreneur. “The New York tech sector is succeeding largely because New York is succeeding.”Another angle: Mayor Bill de Blasio has become a staunch critic of Amazon after the company called off its expansion plans. His stance could help him woo progressive Democrats if he decides to run for president next year. If you have 12 minutes, this is worth itBeijing cracks down, with American helpImageCreditNg Han Guan/Associated PressUnder the guise of free medical checkups in the western region of Xinjiang, the Chinese government has collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data from tens of millions of people. Rights groups and activists say the effort is part of a vast campaign of oppression against Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups. American technology and expertise has helped.Here’s what else is happeningRemaining in Syria: The White House has said that it plans to leave about 200 American troops in Syria, a concession to those who have argued that a complete withdrawal would risk returning key areas to the Islamic State.Special counsel’s report: Robert Mueller is expected to deliver the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Justice Department within weeks, two officials briefed on the preparations said. In an Op-Ed for The Times, the lawyer who drafted the special counsel regulations in 1999 suggests what to expect. Jussie Smollett case: The “Empire” actor, who faces a felony charge of filing a false police report, returned to the TV show’s set after posting $100,000 bond on Thursday. Deadly blaze in Bangladesh: A fire that killed at least 70 people started after a car powered by compressed natural gas exploded, setting off a lethal chain reaction.From The Times: The U.S.-Mexico border is in the news a lot these days, so we’ve started an email newsletter, Crossing the Border. Every week for the next few months, we’ll bring you the stories of some of the millions of people who live along the border.

He died on Thursday at 77. Debate in college sports: Zion Williamson of Duke, who is expected to be the top pick in the N.B.A. draft this year, hurt his knee in a game this week when his shoe fell apart. His injury has raised questions about the amateur status of college athletes and the influence of shoe companies. News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.Late-night comedy: Trevor Noah had some advice for Jussie Smollett, who the police said had faked an attack because he was upset with his salary: “That’s not a good way to get a raise, people. I mean, call me old-fashioned, but whatever happened to just going into your boss’s office and blackmailing him with nudes?” What we’re listening to: This podcast from Radiolab. Dan Saltzstein, our editorial director for special projects, writes: “I’m not a hockey fan, but I adored this moving tale about John Scott, a brawler (in hockey parlance, a goon) who was elected by fans to the All-Star Game — until the N.H.L. stepped in. This very large man became David, up against a corporate Goliath.”Now, a break from the newsImageCreditRomulo Yanes for The New York Times. Stylist: Vivian LuiCook: End the week with Italian flourless chocolate cake.Watch: “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” is definitely, totally not stealing from “Mad Max.” The director, Mike Mitchell, discusses the movie’s version of the apocalypse.See: “By the Way, Meet Vera Stark” is a barbed and booby-trapped comedy about representation and erasure. The Signature Theater Company’s revival is a Critic’s Pick.Read: “How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States,” by Daniel Immerwahr, draws attention to islands and archipelagos too often sidelined in the national imagination. It’s one of the 10 new books we recommend this week. Smarter Living: Beef is widely known as the most emissions-intensive food. Next in line (surprise, surprise) is dairy. By one estimate, the production of dairy products contributes about 3.5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions each year, so
plant-based options can decrease your footprint. Soy, oat or pea milk make reasonable alternatives. And there are plenty of replacements for cheese and ice cream. We also have tips on how to use software like free floor-plan apps and augmented-reality tools to sketch out remodeling ideas.And now for the Back Story on …A familiar face on Wall StreetA reader recently asked us about a trader pictured at the New York Stock Exchange who looked familiar. The reader was right: Peter Tuchman, below, is one of the most photographed traders on the floor.ImageThe trader Peter Tuchman says his resemblance to Albert Einstein “surely brings a lot to the table” for photographers.CreditJeenah Moon/Reuters“I think about Tuchman more than any other person when I think about the stock market,” said Jeenah Moon, a photographer who shoots the exchange, and, on occasion, Mr. Tuchman.There are currently 233 active traders licensed with the exchange, but Ms. Moon usually sees a far smaller number at work. Among them, Mr. Tuchman, a broker since 1988, stands out.In an email, Mr. Tuchman said that he “wears his emotions on his face.”“I thrive off the adrenaline,” he wrote.“I’m like a hurricane whirling its way through the floor,” he added. “And I love it, it’s the greatest job on earth.”That’s it for this briefing.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexBriefingSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperBriefing|Bangladesh, Xinjiang, Venezuela: Your Friday BriefingAdvertisementSupported byBangladesh, Xinjiang, Venezuela: Your Friday BriefingLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani GuptaFeb. 21, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. China builds a database of Uighurs’ DNA, a fire in Bangladesh fits a disturbing pattern and Karl Lagerfeld’s cat expects a comfortable inheritance. Here’s the latest: ImageTahir Imin, a Uighur, had his blood drawn and face scanned by the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang.CreditKate Warren for The New York TimesChina uses DNA to track Uighurs, aided by U.S. expertiseThe country is collecting genetic material as part of its vast campaign of oppression of Muslim minority groups. Critics say the DNA could be used to track and chase down whoever resists conforming. To help it build out the DNA database, China used equipment from a U.S. company, Thermo Fisher, and also got material from a prominent Yale geneticist to compare Uighur DNA with genetic material from people around the world.How it works: Under the guise of free medical checkups in the western region of Xinjiang, where much of the population is Uighur, the government collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data of tens of millions of people.In some cases, people were told the checkups were mandatory.Background: In 2016, the government embarked on a campaign to shift the Muslim orientation of Uighurs and other minority groups into support for the Communist Party, detaining up to a million people in what it calls “re-education” camps — efforts that have been widely condemned around the world.The response: Thermo Fisher said it would stop selling equipment in Xinjiang. And the Yale researcher said he had believed that the Chinese authorities were operating within scientific norms that require the informed consent of DNA donors.ImageFirefighters at the scene in Dhaka.CreditZabed Hasnain Chowdhury/Associated PressA fire in Bangladesh kills dozensA blaze ripped through a crowded, historic neighborhood in the capital city of Dhaka, killing 110 people.Witnesses said it was set off after a gas cylinder stored at the back of a car exploded. Plastics at a nearby store and chemicals stored illegally at another store fed the flames that eventually engulfed everything in its path.Background: Devastating fires and safety disasters are all too common in the country. In 2010, more than 120 people died in a fire in Dhaka that started when an electrical transformer exploded and ignited illegally stored chemicals — a strikingly similar situation to the recent blaze.In 2012, a fire at a garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka burned for more than 17 hours, killing more than 115 people.Government action: Officials have repeatedly vowed to take action against safety violations. But the promises lack any teeth because of lax enforcement on the ground and, sometimes, corruption as business owners pay off officials and regulators.ImageHugo Carvajal, left, Venezuela’s former intelligence chief, urged the military to turn on the president, right.CreditPresidencia/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA former Venezuelan official turns on MaduroThe country’s former intelligence chief called President Nicolás Maduro a dictator with a corrupt inner circle, one of the most public rejections to date.In an interview with The Times, Hugo Carvajal urged the military to break with Mr. Maduro ahead of a showdown with the opposition on Saturday, when tons of aid from the United States and other countries is slated to arrive.“How is it that having the power to allow the entry of international humanitarian aid to our country to save lives, you would decide not to?” he said in a separate statement he released on video. “Would you be so inhuman? So hypnotized?”Complications: On Thursday, Mr. Maduro ordered the closure of Venezuela’s border with Brazil and blocked air and sea traffic from three Caribbean islands to stop aid.Go deeper: An estimated three million people have left Venezuela — largely on foot — fleeing an economic crisis that has created dangerous shortages of food, water, electricity and medicines.ImageCreditAly Song/ReutersHuawei expands in Canada, despite U.S. pressureThe Chinese technology company said it would hire 200 new employees in Canada — a 20 percent increase of its workforce there.The new hires are part of an expansion of Huawei’s research and development efforts in Canada as it tries to secure a place in the development of the country’s 5G network.The U.S. has been pushing its Western allies to ditch Huawei, a company that it claims Beijing uses for espionage.Trend: Britain has not ruled out using Huawei to build out its 5G network, suggesting that the international alliances the U.S. has damaged with various unilateral actions may be shrinking its influence.The U.S. perspective: On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the U.S. would reconsider its relations with countries that choose Huawei to build out their networks.“If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them, we won’t be able to work alongside them,” he said.That could threaten the so-called Five Eyes security arrangement, in which the U.S. and four other close allies, including Britain and Canada, share intelligence.Complications: The American effort to shut out Huawei — as well as the arrest of the company’s top executive, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada — have added to the intricate nature of U.S.-China trade talks, which continue in Washington over the next two days.Here’s what else is happeningThe Vatican: Pope Francis called for “concrete and effective measures” to address clerical sexual abuse at the start of a historic four-day conference at the Vatican, with his moral authority in question and his papal legacy in the balance.India: The country appears determined to follow through on a threat to cut back Pakistan’s water supply after two recent attacks on Indian troops in Kashmir. A top official said the Indus River, which provides water for hundreds of millions of people across the subcontinent, could be diverted.U.S.: A Coast Guard officer and self-described white nationalist who was arrested last week was plotting to kill a long list of journalists and Democratic politicians, prosecutors said, describing him as a “domestic terrorist.” Johnson & Johnson: The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating concerns about possible asbestos contamination of the company’s popular baby powder and other talc-based products.

Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, told a packed hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.CreditCreditJonathan Ernst/ReutersBy Mark Mazzetti and Maggie HabermanFeb. 27, 2019WASHINGTON — He has spent months inside his Park Avenue apartment glued to cable news, his legal bills growing and federal prosecutors amassing evidence against him they would use as leverage.He watched his onetime friend and former boss, now the president of the United States, smear him on Twitter and make vague, public threats about his family.His work for Donald J. Trump, and the lies he told about it, are sending him to prison for years.On Tuesday, his law license was revoked.On Wednesday, Michael D. Cohen exacted his revenge.It was a nasty, public breakup of a New York relationship forged over a decade that was a mix of the bond between a father and son, the professional distance of a lawyer and client, and — as Mr. Cohen and associates have described it — the blind devotion of a henchman to a crime boss.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: The Testimony of Michael CohenIn an extraordinary public hearing, Donald Trump’s former fixer — once known for being unflinchingly loyal — became the star witness against him.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/30:33-30:33transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: The Testimony of Michael CohenHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester, Alexandra Leigh Young and Theo Balcomb, and edited by Lisa TobinIn an extraordinary public hearing, Donald Trump’s former fixer — once known for being unflinchingly loyal — became the star witness against him.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Michael Cohen is headed to prison for lying on behalf of Donald Trump. Yesterday, he told Congress he’s done protecting the president. It’s Thursday, February 28. Maggie Haberman, how does this hearing actually begin on Wednesday morning?maggie habermanThe hearing began in very dramatic fashion with Elijah Cummings, who chairs the committee, a Democrat, holding the gavel. Michael Cohen walking in through this crush of photographers and reporters, trailed by Lanny Davis, his attorney and sometimes spokesman, trailed by another of his attorneys, not by any member of his family, who I believe he was worried about attending this hearing. He sat down. His face was wan. His eyes were puffy. He looked exhausted, and defeated, and beaten down. And you could hear a pin drop as he sat down.archived recording (elijah cummings)The committee will come to order.maggie habermanSo Cummings out of the gate —archived recording (elijah cummings)I now recognize myself for five minutes to give an opening statement.maggie haberman— addressed the issue of Michael Cohen’s credibility.archived recording (elijah cummings)He admitted to lying about his actions to protect the president. Some will certainly ask, if Mr. Cohen was lying then, why should we believe him now?archived recordingGood question.archived recording (elijah cummings)This is a legitimate question.maggie habermanIt was very clear that Republicans were going to go right at Cohen, accusing him of being a liar, somebody who has admitted to lying, including admitting to lying to Congress when he gave testimony before them in 2017. So Cummings was hoping to put that to bed at the outset.archived recording (elijah cummings)This is an important factor we need to weigh. But we must weigh it, and we must hear from him.michael barbaroAnd Maggie, I found it fascinating what Cummings did at the close of this opening statement. He delivers this message straight to Cohen.archived recording (elijah cummings)Martin Luther King, Mr. Cohen, said some words that I leave with you today before you testify. He said, faith is taking the first step, even when you can’t see the whole staircase. There comes a time when silence becomes betrayal. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that truly matter. In the end, he says, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.maggie habermanAnd with that quote, he’s trying to set up Michael Cohen’s testimony — why he’s being truthful, that what he said before is a lie, and what he is saying now is the truth. And this was important for him to set this out as a way forward as the hearing began.archived recording (elijah cummings)Raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative. And thank you, and you may be seated.maggie habermanSo then Michael Cohen begins his opening statement. And it was long.archived recording (michael cohen)I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.maggie habermanAnd he began again by apologizing for lying to Congress.archived recording (michael cohen)I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the committee’s questions truthfully and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.maggie habermanAnd then he turned to Donald Trump.archived recording (michael cohen)I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is.maggie habermanAnd he depicted Donald Trump as a unsavory, unethical, immoral character.archived recording (michael cohen)Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries [expletive]. In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I can name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a [expletive]. This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States. And while we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.maggie habermanSomebody who told him from the Oval Office, in an Oval Office meeting, that he would be sending him a reimbursement for hush money payments.archived recording (michael cohen)Trump is a con man. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about it to his wife, which I did. And lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets.maggie habermanHe portrayed Donald Trump as a cheat.archived recording (michael cohen)And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom are small businesses, that were owed money for their services, and told them that no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I told Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.maggie habermanAs a schemer, who would inflate his net worth or devalue it, depending on what was useful for him at various points.archived recording (michael cohen)It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.maggie habermanAt one point, Michael Cohen told a very detailed story of Donald Trump’s relationship to the Vietnam War. Remember that Donald Trump has said that he had a deferment from the draft because he had, quote, unquote, bone spurs.archived recording (michael cohen)But when I asked for medical records, he gave me none, and said that there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters, but rather, offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment: “Do you think I’m stupid? I’m not going to Vietnam.”maggie habermanAnd at that moment, Michael Cohen looked directly into the camera.archived recording (michael cohen)And I find it ironic, Mr. President, that you are in Vietnam right now.michael barbaroRight.maggie habermanIt was damning stuff.archived recording (michael cohen)A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked documents, the Democratic National Committee emails, ahead of time. And the answer is yes. In July of 2016, days before the Democratic Convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange, and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect, wouldn’t that be great.michael barbaroAnd then he brings up, of course, the now-infamous Moscow project.maggie habermanRight.archived recording (michael cohen)I lied to Congress when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January of 2016. That was false. Our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.maggie habermanHe says that there were, you know, a handful of these conversations that went on into 2016, when it was clear that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican nominee.archived recording (michael cohen)Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me, “There’s no Russian business,” and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. So to be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.michael barbaroCohen’s almost describing, in this moment, a code, where, if Trump is saying to him, there is no Russia project, it’s almost like saying, there’s no Russia project, right? You’re never going to say there’s a Russia project. It’s like he’s trying to explain a foreign language in which Donald Trump is communicating to him, you should probably lie about this, without having to say it.maggie habermanThat’s exactly right. And he said that in his testimony, made very clear that this is how Donald Trump talks. He sort of knows where the line is, and he doesn’t speak overtly. It is what former federal prosecutors have described as mob speak, the style that mafia bosses speak in to avoid crossing a legal line. And while Michael Cohen did not explicitly say that part, he did say that Donald Trump spoke in a code and that Michael Cohen understood that code.archived recording (michael cohen)He doesn’t give you questions. He doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I’ve been around him for a decade.michael barbaroMaggie, did it come as a surprise to you to hear Michael Cohen saying any of this? You’ve known both of these men for years. And you’ve known them as a unit. What was it like to hear Cohen saying these things about Donald Trump?maggie habermanEven knowing that this was coming, it was mind-blowing hearing Michael Cohen saying this in public. No one who has worked for Trump in recent years has gone on the record to say things like this. And it was staggering. And it was so at odds with the portrait of fealty that Michael Cohen had presented with reporters, with everyone, toward Donald Trump over a decade.michael barbaroMm-hmm.maggie habermanAnd remember, Donald Trump creates an eagerness in people around him to get something of a head pat from him, to get an encouragement, to get an attaboy. Cohen got very skilled at trying for that attaboy.michael barbaroAnd seemed to be kind of addicted to it.maggie habermanAnd seemed to be addicted to it, seemed to revel in it, clearly reveled in his proximity.archived recording (michael cohen)Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul-searching. And I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions, in part, that I made.maggie habermanHe was involved in taking care of messes that Donald Trump wanted taken care of. He was willing to do those things. One of them was payoffs to women. And the notion that somebody who was so closely involved in that would be willing to discuss it publicly, not just behind closed doors with investigators, not just as prosecutors were bearing down on him, but freely, in public, in a hearing, under oath, was just breathtaking.michael barbaroThere’s a moment where Cohen says to the members of the committee —archived recording (michael cohen)The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today —michael barbaroToday, I’m here to tell you the truth —archived recording (michael cohen)I am here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.michael barbaro— about Mr. Trump. As if to say, the spell has been broken. I’m out of that world now. And I kind of wonder if that’s really possible, but also how it happened.maggie habermanWell, I think it is really possible, because I think their break has been so incredibly clean, given what has happened to Michael Cohen. Remember, when the F.B.I. raided his hotel and apartment and office in April of 2018, he was still standing by Trump. That clearly has changed. We saw Republicans argue that the reason that changed for Michael Cohen was because he was facing charges of his own. And the president has certainly suggested that. Cohen has been utterly stripped of everything that he valued, his business, his law license. He has been humiliated publicly. He has been abandoned by a lot of friends, and by the president, and by the president’s circle. And so I do think that it is certainly a real split. I think that people are going to have to assess, looking at his testimony, whether they think it’s a real conversion, but it’s definitely a real break.archived recording (michael cohen)I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of. And I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example that I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. And I thank you for your attention. And I’m happy to answer the committee’s questions.archived recording (elijah cummings)Thank you very much, Mr. Cohen. I now recognize myself.michael barbaroSo then the questions begin from the committee members.maggie habermanRight.archived recording (elijah cummings)You said you brought some checks, is that right?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, sir.maggie habermanAnd first we have Cummings asking Cohen to elaborate on the details of these reimbursement checks that he got, that he brought with him.archived recording (elijah cummings)So let me make sure I understand. Donald Trump wrote you a check out of his personal account while he was serving as president of the United States of America to reimburse you for hush money payments to Ms. Clifford, is that what you are telling the American people today?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, Mr. Chairman.maggie habermanAnd it was among the more dramatic moments that we saw. Because Cummings is getting to the fact that the sitting president was part of this scheme that was, at minimum, sleazy and illicit, and at maximum could have some criminal exposure. And they were leaving nothing to doubt as to what Cohen was saying took place.archived recording (elijah cummings)Is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for?archived recording (michael cohen)There is no doubt in my mind. And I truly believe there is no doubt in the minds of the people of the United States of America.archived recording (elijah cummings)With that I’ll yield to —maggie habermanJim Jordan, another ally of the president, quoted something that Michael Cohen once said to a reporter from The Daily Beast.archived recording (jim jordan)“I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse and I will take you for every penny you still don’t have.”maggie habermanAnd this has now become a famous anecdote, where he threatened a reporter who was pursuing a story about an old court claim from the divorce filing between Ivana Trump and Donald Trump, where she had alleged marital rape. And Cohen said —archived recording (jim jordan)“And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I’m warning you — ”maggie haberman“So I’m warning you, tread very f-ing lightly” — it wasn’t f-ing.archived recording (jim jordan)“Because what I’m going to do to you is going to be f-ing disgusting, you understand me?”maggie habermanAnd he was then asked by Jim Jordan, “Mr. Cohen, who said that?”archived recording (jim jordan)Mr. Cohen, who said that?archived recording (michael cohen)I did.maggie habermanAnd it’s an incident that I think he would say that he really was doing for Trump and not for himself. But it was a way to sully his character and create a portrait of thuggishness.archived recording (jim jordan)And did you say that, Mr. Cohen, was that statement that I just read that you admitted to saying, did you do that to protect Donald Trump?archived recording (michael cohen)I did it to protect Mr. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump.michael barbaroBut I wonder, who does it look worse for, the person who did it, or the person on whose behalf it was done?maggie habermanRight. I understand that Jim Jordan is trying to muddy Michael Cohen with that. But I think for most people, they are going to look at that, and especially after the president takes to Twitter and suggests that people ought to be looking into Michael Cohen’s family, I think most people are still going to see that as looking worse for Trump, because Michael Cohen was doing this as Trump’s lawyer.michael barbaroSo while Republicans are largely avoiding talking about the president at all costs in this hearing, in focusing on sullying Cohen’s character and reputation, they may be actually sullying President Trump’s.maggie habermanCorrect. They were essentially trying to peel Cohen off from Trump. And what became clear as their efforts went on throughout the hearing is that that is impossible to do. When you have had somebody serve as a lawyer for Donald Trump, so identified with him publicly over 10 years, you can’t take a shot at Cohen and not end up having it ricochet onto Trump too.archived recordingSo we’ve established that you lie on your taxes, you lie to banks, and you have been convicted of lying to Congress. It seems to me that there’s not much that you won’t lie about when you stand to gain from it.michael barbaroAnd where do the questions go from here?maggie habermanSo —archived recordingEverything’s been made of your lies in the past. I’m concerned about your lies today.maggie habermanAfter that it became a, you know —archived recordingBut there’s no truth with you whatsoever.maggie haberman— one by one, down the line, Republicans suggesting that Michael Cohen was —archived recordingLiar, liar, pants on fire.maggie habermanReally in it for the fame.archived recordingIs your appearance here today motivated by your desire to remain in the spotlight for your personal benefit?archived recording (michael cohen)No, ma’am.maggie habermanOr he was really in it for the money. They asked him —archived recordingIs there a book deal coming or anything like that?archived recording (michael cohen)I have no book deal right now.maggie habermanOne after the other about prospective book deals or movie deals.archived recordingIsn’t it true you tried to sell a book about your time with President Trump, entitled “Trump Revolution: From the Tower to the White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump“?archived recording (michael cohen)Yes, that happened —maggie habermanOr had he pitched a book of his own?michael barbaroAnd what did he say?maggie habermanHe said yes.archived recording (michael cohen)I have been contacted by many, including for television, a movie. If you want to tell me who you would like to play you, I’m more than happy to write the name down.michael barbaroAnd what about the Democrats?archived recording (elijah cummings)Mr. Raskin.archived recording (jamie raskin)Mr. Cohen, thank you for your composure today. Our colleagues are not upset because you lied to Congress for the president. They’re upset because you’ve stopped lying to Congress for the president.maggie habermanThe Democrats tried to keep it really mostly on Trump and the things that Michael Cohen did for Trump.archived recordingAnd nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through President Donald Trump, correct?archived recording (michael cohen)That’s 100 percent certain.archived recordingO.K.maggie habermanHe described, and it was really interesting, he described everybody as being solely devoted to protecting the brand and reputation of one man, Donald Trump. He said that nothing happened at the company unless Donald Trump was aware of it or signed off on it. He argued that Trump was a demanding and exacting and punishing boss. He described the entire effort as being about maximizing the gold-plated version of Donald Trump that we have all become very familiar with.archived recordingThere’s a recurring refrain in your testimony that says, and yet, I continued to work for him. But at some point you changed. What was the breaking point at which you decided to start telling the truth?archived recording (michael cohen)There are several factors — Helsinki, Charlottesville.maggie habermanHe went on this litany of moments that he said disgusted him. There were the president’s comments after Charlottesville, that it was, you know, various instance of discourteous behavior by the president, of untoward behavior toward citizens.archived recording (michael cohen)Watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up silly things like this.archived recordingOh, that’s silly.archived recording (michael cohen)Really unbecoming of Congress.maggie habermanHe clearly got angry. And then he sort of turned it back on Republicans and said to them, essentially —archived recording (michael cohen)It’s that sort of behavior that I’m responsible for. I’m responsible for your silliness. Because I did the same thing that you’re doing now, for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.maggie habermanYou are what I was. You are all blindly following him. And there is a real risk to doing that, because you could end up like me someday.archived recording (michael cohen)And I can only warn people, the more people that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.maggie habermanIt was a gripping and captivating moment.michael barbaroRight, it was a sort of surprising level of self-awareness, and I guess also self-loathing too.maggie habermanIt was both. It was self-effacing. It was clearly uncomfortable. It was acknowledging that he is a deeply imperfect person who did imperfect things that he is not proud of, and he said a version of that earlier in the hearing. But it was really striking, because this is a comment that Republicans who opposed Donald Trump, and they’re not very many of them who are that vocal anymore, but that they have said repeatedly that the Republican Party has become a cult of personality, or just a cult. And that people just blindly follow along with what Donald Trump wants, whether it is wise or not, whether it is safe or not, and whether he is telling the truth or not. And that is what Cohen was getting at.archived recordingWhat do you want your children to know?archived recording (michael cohen)That I’m sorry for everything. And I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve caused them. And um — I wish I could go back in time.archived recordingThank you, I yield back.archived recording (elijah cummings)The gentlelady’s time has expired.michael barbaroMaggie, I wonder if you feel like you understand what’s motivating Michael Cohen throughout this hours-long hearing, to say what he’s saying, to concede what he’s conceding, to kind of humble himself the way he did. He’s been convicted of a crime. He’s headed to prison. He has been disbarred. What exactly is animating him at this point?maggie habermanI think a number of things are animating him. But I think among them is that he doesn’t want to be the leper of this story forever. He said months ago that he does not want to be the villain in the Trump story. And I think that’s how he feels. I think that he does not want to be remembered as this footnote in history. I think he’s going to prison. And I think he doesn’t have a whole lot left to lose. And I think that he would like to try to make people remember other things about him and tell a more nuanced tale.michael barbaroAnd so, what did this hearing, in your mind, achieve? How will this hearing be remembered in this larger story?maggie habermanI think this hearing is either going to be, on its own, just a breathtaking historical moment, the likes of which I don’t know if we’ll ever see again. But it was pretty striking to see. Or it is going to be the initial phases of a much broader, deeper governmental investigation by House Democrats into the Trump presidency, not just his own personal activities, but the activities of his government. And allowing Michael Cohen to have a setting where he talks about these things, and where he can be questioned, and where he is a key starting witness could be the first step in paving the way toward an impeachment process, if that is where Democrats go. If that ends up leading to something bigger, then Democrats will feel as if this was a key foundation for it. But it’s too early to say, I think.archived recording (michael cohen)I have some closing remarks I would like to say myself. Is this an appropriate time?archived recording (elijah cummings)You can do it now.archived recording (michael cohen)Thank you.michael barbaroMaggie, how does this one of hearing finally come to an end?maggie habermanSeven and a half hours after Michael Cohen first entered this room, sitting pretty patiently through all of these questions, not losing his temper, he was given an opportunity to speak not just to the committee members, but to the president.archived recording (michael cohen)In closing, I’d like to say directly to the president, we honor our veterans, even in the rain. You tell the truth, even when it doesn’t aggrandize you.maggie habermanAnd he used that opportunity to send a message to his former boss, saying, you don’t need to be this person.archived recording (michael cohen)You take responsibility for your own dirty deeds. You don’t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you. You don’t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don’t vilify people based on the God they pray to. And you don’t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies.maggie habermanAnd what he was saying to the president, you and I both know who you are, and he was saying to the members of the committee, you should believe me when I say that I understand this man.archived recording (michael cohen)So to those who support the president and his rhetoric, as I once did, I pray the country doesn’t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying. And I thank you very much for this additional time, Chairman.archived recording (elijah cummings)Thank you very much.maggie habermanAnd when Michael Cohen was done, Elijah Cummings closed with this note of grace toward Michael Cohen.archived recording (elijah cummings)So you wonder whether people believe you. I don’t know. I don’t know whether they believe you. But the fact is that you’ve come, you have your head down. And this has got to be one of the hardest things that you could do.maggie habermanThat was the moment when Michael Cohen started crying. And he really hadn’t done that. He was clearly weeping.archived recording (elijah cummings)I know that you face a lot. I know that you are worried about your family. But this is a part of your destiny.maggie habermanAnd Cummings basically told Cohen, you are doing what you should be doing. You are heading toward the light in this moment.archived recording (elijah cummings)And hopefully, this portion of your destiny will lead to a better — a better Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America and a better world.michael barbaroMaggie, thank you very, very much. We appreciate it.maggie habermanMichael, thanks for having me.archived recording (elijah cummings)And we have got to get back to normal. With that, this meeting is adjourned. [MUSIC PLAYING]michael barbaroWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, Pakistan said it had shot down two Indian fighter jets and captured a pilot from one of them in the latest escalation of hostilities between the two countries. The attack is heightening fears that the decades-old animosities between India and Pakistan could spiral into war. The latest episode began on February 14th, when jihadis operating out of Pakistan killed 40 Indian soldiers, prompting airstrikes from India, and now, a military response from Pakistan.archived recording[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Bomb blast victims in [INAUDIBLE].michael barbaroIn a speech on Wednesday, the prime minister of Pakistan urged restraint, citing the two countries’ arsenals of nuclear weapons, saying quote, “All big wars have been due to miscalculation.

Dallas, who collected absentee ballots for Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris last fall, was charged with obstruction of justice and possession of absentee ballots. As a result of Dallas’ conduct, North Carolina will hold a new election for the 9th congressional district. Harris, who hired Dallas, has withdrawn from that race. [MUSIC PLAYING] That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.“People that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering,” he told a packed hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform — a blunt warning to congressional Republicans he said have assumed the same role as Mr. Trump’s protectors that he played for years.During hours of lurid testimony, the president’s once-loyal lawyer and fixer recalled shady business deals and racist comments, and spoke in devastating, uncomfortable detail about his private conversations with the man he had idolized and still refers to only as “Mr. Trump.”Michael D. Cohen’s Congressional TestimonyMichael D. Cohen, the former lawyer and fixer for President Donald J. Trump, took the stand on Wednesday morning to testify publicly against Mr. Trump before the House Oversight Committee.[Mr. Trump “inflated” the value of his assets in documents given to Deutsche Bank, Mr. Cohen testified.]Such deference did not keep him from painting a damning portrait of the president, including Mr. Trump’s attempts to dodge Vietnam War service and his efforts to strong-arm academic institutions from making his grades public. There were the routine indignities, like when the president put Mr. Cohen on the phone with the first lady to lie to her about a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film star with whom Mr. Trump is alleged to have had an affair.Mr. Cohen described Mr. Trump as a “con man” and a “cheat,” and estimated there might have been 500 occasions on which he directly threatened someone at the behest of his boss. He was Mr. Trump’s enforcer, a role he once seemed to relish.“If somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn’t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump’s benefit,” he told an interviewer in 2011. “If you do something wrong, I’m going to come at you, grab you by the neck, and I’m not going to let you go until I’m finished.”More recently, after Mr. Cohen agreed to tell prosecutors about hush-money payments before the 2016 election, it was the president’s turn to use a Mafioso’s description of his formerly loyal aide. He called him a “rat.”Such was the vernacular the two men honed over years spent navigating gritty but potentially lucrative New York industries — construction, real estate and taxicabs. At the hearing, Mr. Cohen gave the House panel a tutorial of sorts on the folkways of a New York ecosystem in which he and Mr. Trump had thrived.ImageMr. Cohen arrived to testify before Congress on Wednesday.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesOn the day that Mr. Cohen was the star witness in a congressional hearing devised to exhume the president’s past, Mr. Trump was thousands of miles away — preparing for a summit meeting with North Korea’s leader he was hoping would lend gravitas to his embattled presidency, and distract from what was taking place back home.For Mr. Cohen, a man who once walked the hallways of the Trump Organization with a pistol strapped to his ankle and seemed to bask in Mr. Trump’s reflected glory, Wednesday was a moment to absorb the light.“Michael would describe it as being something akin to a cult,” said Donny Deutsch, the advertising executive and friend of Mr. Cohen. “Michael got sucked into it. And his life is in shambles because of it. And he’s the first one to say that.”The BeginningsThe relationship between the two men began in the way that many of Mr. Trump’s relationships do: with an act of fealty.In 2006, residents of Trump World Tower — a gleaming glass tower near the United Nations — were pushing to strip Mr. Trump’s name from the building and take control of the building’s management.Mr. Cohen, a former personal injury lawyer who had made millions in the New York City taxicab business, intervened after Mr. Trump’s son Donald Jr. asked for help. Mr. Cohen had already bought several condominiums in Trump buildings, persuaded family and friends to do the same, and had twice read Mr. Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal.” He helped Mr. Trump put down the East Side rebellion, orchestrating a coup that removed the revolting tenants from the condominium board. Mr. Trump took notice.ImageMr. Cohen defended Mr. Trump in a fight with tenants at his Trump World Tower building in New York.CreditHiroko Masuike/The New York TimesIn some ways, it was an unequal relationship between two men of different ages, different upbringings and vastly different financial circumstances. Mr. Cohen, the son of a Holocaust survivor, was just 40 years old when he began working for Mr. Trump — 20 years his elder and the son of a real estate magnate who would inherit millions of dollars of his father’s money.But Mr. Cohen had a comfortable upbringing in Lawrence, on Long Island, a dozen or so miles from the house in Queens where Mr. Trump had been raised. And like his future boss, Mr. Cohen combined raw business savvy with help from a family member — in his case, his father-in-law — to make a mark in the boroughs outside Manhattan.Mr. Cohen was soon a Trump Organization employee, put in charge of disparate elements of Mr. Trump’s business empire. In 2008, he became chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a venture started by Mr. Trump to bring mixed martial arts fights to a pay-per-view audience.“I’m nearly speechless knowing Mr. Trump and Affliction have the trust in me for an event that features the greatest assembly of M.M.A. fighters for one show in M.M.A. history,” Mr. Cohen said in a news release announcing his new position, adding that the coming event was “like having Ali, Frazier, Tyson, Holyfield and other top heavyweights all on the same boxing card.”Working for Mr. Trump, he told lawmakers on Wednesday, was “intoxicating.”“When you were in his presence,” he said, “you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself — that you were somehow changing the world.”He tried to appeal to his boss by embodying the qualities that Mr. Trump had once admired in his own mentor, Roy Cohn. A Bronx-born lawyer, Mr. Cohn rose to prominence working for Senator Joseph McCarthy’s anti-Communist crusade and then spent years as Mr. Trump’s lawyer. Like Mr. Cohen, he was disbarred for unethical conduct.How Trump Fits Into, and Denies, Cohen’s NarrativeWednesday’s congressional hearing is focusing in part on how much Trump knew about hush money payments and a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.“Roy was brutal, but he was a very loyal guy,” Mr. Trump once told a biographer. “He brutalized for you.”Over time, Mr. Cohen learned how Mr. Trump liked to do business.“He doesn’t give you questions, he doesn’t give you orders,” he said on Wednesday. “He speaks in code, and I understand the code because I’ve been around him for a decade.”Shunted to the SidelinesIn 2011 Mr. Cohen began scouting prospects for another brawl, a possible presidential run by Mr. Trump in 2012. He traveled to Iowa and accompanied Mr. Trump to a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he acted like a bar bouncer keeping reporters away from his celebrity boss. Mr. Cohen set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org.He did not. But almost immediately after the presidential race was over, Mr. Cohen began compiling information for his boss for the next time. He kept a thick binder on his desk at Trump Tower packed with information about filing deadlines in different states for the 2016 election and other campaign minutiae.But he was shunted to the sidelines when the campaign began, prohibited by Mr. Trump’s children and other political operatives from making day-to-day campaign decisions. He pursued other business ventures for Mr. Trump, including the ambitious idea of building the tallest skyscraper in Moscow emblazoned with the Trump name.Trying to gain access to influential figures in Moscow, Mr. Cohen turned to Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant, felon and F.B.I. informant who had helped Mr. Trump with other development deals and had explored various ventures in Russia.ImageDespite his loyalty to Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen was sidelined during his 2016 presidential campaign.CreditDamon Winter/The New York TimesThis effort became a central focus of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining Russia’s attempts to sabotage the 2016 election and any role Mr. Trump’s advisers played in coordinating with Moscow. And the lies Mr. Cohen told about the negotiations put him in even more legal jeopardy.On Wednesday, he apologized to lawmakers for lying to a different congressional panel in 2017, when he said that the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations ended in January 2016, before the first presidential primaries. In fact, they continued for months longer.“To be clear,” he said, “Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.”“And so I lied about it, too,” he added.After he won the election, Mr. Trump brought many of his longtime confidants to the White House, but Mr. Cohen was left behind. He was disappointed but remained a loyal backbencher, raising money for Mr. Trump’s re-election fund and publicly attacking celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Johnny Depp for their anti-Trump comments.Republicans at Wednesday’s hearing tried to cast Mr. Cohen as an embittered former aide trying to get payback for being excluded from a White House job. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s son Eric said that Mr. Cohen was known within the campaign to be seeking a job.Mr. Cohen has insisted over the past two years — and did again on Wednesday — that he never had any interest in moving to Washington, uprooting his family and giving up his job as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. He said that Mr. Trump had wanted him for a White House job, and was upset when it did not work out.ImageMr. Cohen leaving federal court in New York after his sentencing hearing last year.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesRegardless of the actual circumstances, Mr. Cohen’s absence from the administration created a distance between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump that would become a chasm.Implicating the BossWhen F.B.I. agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and apartment last April, carting off years of business records, emails and other documents, Mr. Cohen relied on his first instinct — he would not flip.He took at least one call from Mr. Trump, who urged him to stay strong. His lawyers strategized with the president’s, and Mr. Trump praised him and insisted his former fixer and lawyer would never cooperate with prosecutors.That would change by July, as his legal problems mounted and his friends urged him not to take the fall for Mr. Trump. He changed his Twitter bio page, removing any mention of being Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, a move people close to him said was a deliberate signal of his independence.Around that time, officials at Mr. Trump’s company began to balk at paying some of Mr. Cohen’s legal fees.He pleaded guilty in August to financial crimes, and in his guilty plea he implicated his former boss in a scheme to pay hush money to two women before the 2016 election.It was an extraordinary turn for a once-devoted soldier — a decision that Mr. Cohen on Wednesday described as a catharsis.“I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man,” he said before a hushed room.“I have fixed things. But I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump.”Correction: Feb. 27, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the building where Michael D. Cohen put down a rebellion by tenants.

(Want this by email? Sign up here.)Chevron’s big diversity push? Talk to menDealBook exclusive: The energy company plans to announce today that it has given $5 million to Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on making corporate America more hospitable toward women.It’s funding Men Advocating Real Change, a Catalyst campaign that teaches male executives how to improve diversity and inclusion at their companies. (Among its tactics: lessons on unconscious bias.) Lorraine Hariton, Catalyst’s C.E.O., said it was the single biggest grant in the nonprofit’s 50-year history.Chevron has been a longtime supporter of Catalyst. It began working with the nonprofit 20 years ago, and Mike Wirth, the oil and gas giant’s C.E.O., helped introduce this program to the company two years ago. It now runs in seven Chevron offices worldwide.Diversity and inclusion has improved at Chevron. In 2010, only 6 percent of its board and 11 percent of its management committee were women. Now, it’s 36 percent for the board and 20 percent for the management committee. “I think the business case for this is compelling,” Mr. Wirth told Michael de la Merced of DealBook, saying more diversity has improved innovation.But there’s still a lot to do. Mr. Wirth said that oil and gas needed far more women in engineering and technical roles. And Ms. Hariton said that while companies have been hiring more women, the number of top female executives remains too small.As Trump softens on China, critics circlePresident Trump is facing increasing pressure from Republicans, Democrats and even some of his own advisers to win the kind of large concessions that Beijing has long resisted, Alan Rappeport of the NYT writes.Mr. Trump has softened his threats against China. “Citing ‘substantial progress’ in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week,” Mr. Rappeport explains.But the Chinese may be dangling false promises, some top Democrats say, in hopes of ending a trade war that is damaging their economy, as well as hurting American farmers. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit and offers relief to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.Many big sticking points remain, including China’s state subsidies for its businesses. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administration’s demands over intellectual property and cybertheft.“The blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim he’s being tough on China, analysts said,” according to Mr. Rappeport.More: The FT imagines what a trade deal might look like. Trade war is only one of the threats worrying President Xi Jinping of Chin. U.S. companies are planning their lowest rate of expansion in China since 2016. And a delay on further tariffs probably staved off inflation in America.ImageElon MuskCreditDavid Mcnew/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesElon Musk’s tweets anger the S.E.C., againThe Securities and Exchange Commission says a series of tweets Elon Musk published last week violate its agreement with Tesla, and wants him held in contempt of court.Mr. Musk got in trouble last year by tweeting that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, when that wasn’t exactly the case. Tesla settled, promising the S.E.C. that it would set up “mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk’s Tesla-related written communications.”Then last week, he tweeted about a manufacturing triumph, saying Tesla would make “around 500,000” cars this year, up from a target of 400,000. He soon corrected himself and repeated the target of 400,000 deliveries. Tesla’s lawyers conceded that Mr. Musk hadn’t had his tweets reviewed, but argued “the substance” of his post had already been vetted and publicly disclosed. Mr. Musk followed up by needling the S.E.C., tweeting that it “forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript,” in which he forecast production of between 350,000 and 500,000 cars. “How embarrassing,” he added.“This is not an innocuous tweet,” Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, told the NYT. “Insiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public.”Punishments the S.E.C. could seek, Ms. Roiphe said, include a fine, more restrictions on Mr. Musk’s social media use, or even his removal as C.E.O.Is the game changing on Brexit?With just over a month to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U., Prime Minister Theresa May could U-turn on her commitment to keeping to schedule. And the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, under heavy pressure, has promised to support a second public vote.Mrs. May is letting her cabinet think the unthinkable. The prime minister, who has repeatedly insisted that Brexit will occur on March 29, will allow her colleagues “to discuss extending the deadline” today, according to Bloomberg, which sets out what she’d be risking and why:• “On one hand, it would avert mass resignations from pro-E.U. ministers in May’s team, and potentially a defeat in Parliament this week.”• “But it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from Euroskeptic Conservatives.”And Mr. Corbyn has made a big concession to pro-Europeans. He had long resisted a second Brexit referendum, but has had to reconsider after several pro-E.U. lawmakers quit his Labour Party. Stephen Castle of the NYT explains what the reversal means:• “At the moment, it is unlikely that a second vote would win a majority in Parliament because most lawmakers still oppose the idea.”• “But if Mrs. May’s Brexit plan is rejected next month for a second time, then the calculation in Parliament could change.”The misery of Facebook’s moderatorsDozens of current and former employees of a company called Cognizant, which reviews content for the social network, spoke to the Verge. The investigation makes for grim reading:• “Employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions.”• “In stark contrast to the perks lavished on Facebook employees, team leaders micromanage content moderators’ every bathroom and prayer break,” and employees “have been found having sex inside stairwells.”• “They are pressured not to discuss the emotional toll that their job takes on them, even with loved ones, leading to increased feelings of isolation and anxiety.”• “Moderators told me it’s a place where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace fringe views. One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the Earth is flat.”• “Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year — while the average Facebook employee has a total compensation of $240,000.” Facebook’s response: In a statement yesterday, it said it was “putting in place a rigorous and regular compliance and audit process for all of our outsourced partners to ensure they are complying with the contracts and care we expect.”Bank of America kills off Merrill LynchBank of America plans to erase the Merrill Lynch name from its investment banking and trading arms. They’ll go by “BofA Securities” rather than “Bank of America Merrill Lynch,” and its wealth-management unit will be “Merrill.”It’s the end of an era. Merrill Lynch was one of the best-known names on Wall Street when Bank of America bought it during the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, Bank of America was a big lender, built from years of acquisitions — but a minnow in high finance.The combined firm struggled with culture clashes. Longtime Merrill employees were proud of “Mother Merrill” and the “thundering herd” that was its wealth-management arm. The WSJ reports that Bank of America backed away from changing the name before.But now it wants a seamless identity. “We are continuing to unify the company, continuing down the road we started on a decade ago,” Bank of America’s C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, told the WSJ. (He has also pushed the firm into safe businesses, de-emphasizing the risk-taking that left Merrill needing a buyer.)The only place where staying as Merrill made sense was in wealth management. Mr. Moynihan called it “the No. 1 brand there is.”ImageJanet YellenCreditJoshua Roberts/Reuters Yellen says Trump doesn’t get the FedLast year, President Trump replaced Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve. Since, Mr. Trump has broken with precedent by publicly criticizing Mr. Powell for raising interest rates. Ms. Yellen has now made clear what she thinks of all that in an interview with Marketplace.• When the host of Marketplace, Kai Ryssdal, asked if she thought the president “has a grasp of macroeconomic policy,” Ms. Yellen replied, “No, I do not.”• When asked to elaborate, she said, “Well, I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed’s goals are maximum employment and price stability.”• “He’s made comments about the Fed having an exchange rate objective in order to support his trade plans, or possibly targeting the U.S. balance of trade,” she added. “And, you know, I think comments like that shows a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals.”Revolving doorAmazon added the former PepsiCo C.E.O.

Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks progress, with fears of overcompromiseAmerican and Chinese officials have reportedly begun to hash out documents that could form the basis of a trade deal, but there are growing concerns that leaders of both nations are softening on key demands. More on the progress from Bloomberg, citing an unidentified source:• Several memorandums of understanding “would cover areas including agriculture, non-tariff barriers, services, technology transfer and intellectual property, said the person.”• “The enforcement mechanism remains unclear, but would likely be a threat that tariffs would be reimposed if conditions aren’t met, the person said.”• “No breakthrough is expected during this week’s talks,” though an extension to a March 1 deadline is still a possibility.But there’s a new fear surrounding the deal. According to Lingling Wei and Bob Davis of the WSJ, there are “growing concerns on the home front” in both America and China that their leaders — and President Trump in particular — are “going to cave in to the other side”:• Some officials reportedly believe Mr. Trump is “tiring of the trade dispute and is poised to cut a deal that won’t lead to fundamental changes by China.”• “American Enterprise Institute China scholar Derek Scissors said that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a China hawk, holds significant leverage over Mr. Trump to keep to a hard line — including, potentially, the threat of resigning if the deal falls short.”More trade news: Mr. Trump reportedly continues to consider E.U. car tariffs — levies that Volkswagen says could cost it billions of euros per year. And is the clothes maker American Giant, which makes all its products in the U.S., a model for Mr. Trump’s ambitions?Wall Street sees profits in helping Main StreetHedge funds and investment banks think they’ve found a big new moneymaker, according to Matt Goldstein and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: so-called opportunity funds, part of President Trump’s tax package to steer money to poor areas by offering large tax breaks.• “More than 80 of the funds have sprung up since January 2018, even though the Trump administration has not finalized regulations governing them.”• The pitch to potential investors: outsize returns while fighting poverty.• The provision that created opportunity funds “lowers capital gains taxes — potentially dramatically — for investors who finance projects in about 8,700 so-called opportunity zones spread across the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.”• The financial benefit? “An investor who keeps money in such a fund for 10 years is able to exclude 15 percent of the original capital gain from taxation. And — potentially much more lucratively — the investor would not owe taxes on any gains that accrued if the investment increased in value in that time.”• “Skeptics worry that the funds will mostly target real estate and other projects that probably would have attracted investment even without the tax break, and may not deliver the returns being dangled.”ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission’s president.CreditYves Herman/ReutersTheresa May could be making progress on BrexitThe British prime minister was in Brussels yesterday to press for changes that could save her Brexit deal. She may finally be making some headway, though she still needs to convince lawmakers of any changes to her plan.She made her case to the E.U. In discussions with the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, she pressed for “legally binding changes” to her existing deal that she hopes will make it palatable to British lawmakers. Britain’s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, are expected to propose wordings for those legal tweaks today.Some progress may have been made. “A Brexit agreement is already being hammered out in Brussels, according to Spain’s foreign minister, as the bloc seeks reassuring language that can convince British members of Parliament to back the deal,” Bloomberg explains.But the E.U. may demand that any changes are first approved in Britain. The E.U. “doesn’t want to call leaders for a summit to sign off on changes that are then rejected by the U.K. Parliament,” Bloomberg reports, adding that “once there’s an agreement, it should be tested in Parliament, and only after that will leaders be asked to sign off on it at a summit.” And it is far from clear that lawmakers would approve.More Brexit news: Nine more Conservative party lawmakers have reportedly said that they could resign from the party in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The credit agency Fitch may downgrade Britain’s double-A rating over concerns about Brexit. Europe isn’t convinced by Trump’s war on HuaweiThe White House has spent the last year trying to convince Europe that the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is a national security threat and shouldn’t be given any role in developing new wireless networks. So far, that plan doesn’t appear to be working.British officials don’t seem to agree with the White House. “Ciaran Martin, who leads Britain’s National Cyber Security Center, expressed confidence at a conference in Brussels that any security risks Huawei posed could be managed,” Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.Nor do those in Germany. The news follows a WSJ report yesterday that said “the German government is leaning toward letting Huawei Technologies Co. participate in building the nation’s high-speed internet infrastructure.”“If Britain does not ban Huawei, it would be a defeat for the White House,” Mr. Satariano writes. “Because Britain belongs to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States, whatever it decides on Huawei is likely to affect how other countries treat the company.”Deutsche Bank lost $1.6 billion on a Buffett-related betThe German lender suffered one of its biggest-ever trading losses from a decade-long wager on a municipal-bond investment that spiraled out of control, the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources.• The bank bought $7.8 billion worth of municipal bonds in 2007, later covered with insurance purchased from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.• The WSJ says Deutsche Bank “resisted for years reducing the value of those bonds and related derivatives on its books to a level that markets suggested they were worth,” and dismissed concerns from auditors.• “Internally, the bank acknowledged losses on the trade only incrementally. After it finally liquidated the position nine years after buying the bonds, bank executives debated whether to restate past financial results, but never did so.”• Deutsche Bank finally liquidated the position in the summer of 2016, after its C.E.O. at the time, John Cryan, demanded the trade be wound down.• “The prolonged struggle over how to handle the investment sheds light on cultural and financial challenges inside one of Europe’s biggest banks that have hampered its ability to compete with stronger U.S. rivals.”More Deutsche Bank news: Executives were reportedly so worried about the Trump Organization defaulting on $340 million in loans during the Trump presidency that they discussed extending repayment dates until 2025.France fines UBS $4.2 billion in tax evasion caseThe Swiss bank was hit by one of France’s biggest-ever financial penalties yesterday for helping wealthy French clients hide money from the authorities.The judgment was seven years in the making. French authorities began investigating after whistle-blowers tipped them off. According to the NYT, prosecutors said that UBS bankers in France eager for big bonuses “had alerted their counterparts in Switzerland to potential ‘big potatoes’ ” — French citizens with assets of at least €500,000, or about $560,000.Bankers used “James Bond” methods to hide their work. They “followed a UBS ‘security governance manual’ that included instructions for using encrypted computers, using business cards without the bank’s logo and switching hotels frequently,” according to the NYT.UBS will appeal. The firm said that the case was “based on the unfounded allegations of former employees,” and its C.E.O. derided the verdict as “superficial” and “astounding.”Pedophile comments spur a YouTube ad boycottMajor companies including Nestlé and Epic Games said yesterday that they had stopped buying ads on Google’s video platform. The reason, the NYT reports: Pedophiles were swarming the comment sections of children’s videos.The companies acted after a user posted a video that pointed out that innocent videos of youngsters were being overrun with suggestive comments aimed at the children.The video’s creator, Matt Watson, accused YouTube of “facilitating the sexual exploitation” of children. He added that the site’s recommendation system guided predators to other videos featuring minors.A Google spokeswoman said the company had taken action by deleting accounts and offensive comments. “Any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube,” she said.ImageElizabeth Holmes of TheranosCreditJeff Chiu/Associated PressInside the final throes of TheranosAt this point, the blood-testing company is over. But Nick Bilton of Vanity Fair writes that in its final months, Theranos’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, tried to abandon a high-spending lifestyle and attempted to convince employees that everything was O.K.:• “Holmes had a hard time weaning herself off certain luxuries. She still had her own personal security detail, drivers, personal assistants and a personal publicist who was on retainer for $25,000 a month.”• “By late 2017, however, Holmes had begun to slightly rein in the spending.” She agreed to give up her private-jet travel, and moved the company’s premises from Palo Alto to Newark, to premises that former employees called “crummy.”• “Yet through all of this, former employees of the company have told me, Holmes had a bizarre way of acting like nothing was wrong. Even more peculiarly, she appeared happy. ‘The company is falling apart, there are countless indictments piling up, employees are leaving in droves, and Elizabeth is just weirdly chipper,’ a former senior executive told me.”America’s professional elite: rich and miserable?Those in the upper echelon are hoarding money and privilege to a degree not seen in decades. But that doesn’t make them happy at work, Charles Duhigg writes in the NYT:• “A surprising portion of Americans are professionally miserable right now. In the mid-1980s, roughly 61 percent of workers told pollsters they were satisfied with their jobs. Since then, that number has declined substantially, hovering around half, according to data collected by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization.”• “Even among professionals given to lofty self-images, like those in medicine and law, other studies have noted a rise in discontent.”• “Why? Based on my own conversations with classmates and the research I began reviewing, the answer comes down to oppressive hours, political infighting, increased competition sparked by globalization, an ‘always-on culture’ bred by the internet — but also something that’s hard for these professionals to put their finger on, an underlying sense that their work isn’t worth the grueling effort they’re putting into it.”Revolving doorDane Butswinkas is stepping down as Tesla’s general counsel, only two months after joining the carmaker from the law firm Williams & Connolly.Keith Rabois, the veteran investor, is leaving Khosla Ventures for Founders Fund, the venture capital firm run by his longtime friend Peter Thiel.Robin Phillips, a co-head of HSBC’s global banking division, will reportedly step down this summer.Serena Williams joined the board of Poshmark, an online retailer.The speed readDeals• Lyft plans to begin its I.P.O. roadshow on March 18, paving the way to begin trading publicly on the Nasdaq stock market by early April.
