What’s happening?Big tech companies are reporting lackluster results. Weak Chinese consumer demand blew a $9 billion hole in Apple’s latest quarterly sales. Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations. Intel’s January financials didn’t meet forecasts. And Samsung’s sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter.Behind the trend: semiconductors. “China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand,” write David Streitfeld and Don Clark of the NYT. With chip manufacturers predicting slumping sales for 2019, tech more generally could be in line for a slowdown.Sound familiar? “The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust,” write Mr. Streitfeld and Mr. Clark.And the industry no longer carries the stock market. For years, stock market performance have been tied to the fortunes of the largest tech companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix. As the S&P 500 pushed to a record high last summer, rises in those six companies’ share prices accounted for half of its gain. But when the index rallied nearly 8 percent in January, Stephen Grocer writes, their stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the rise.Lloyd Blankfein may pay for Goldman’s links to 1MDBThe former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. — as well as his successor, David Solomon, and other top executives — may have to give back some compensation from 2018, depending on the findings of an investigation into the firm’s work with the scandal-ridden Malaysian investment fund 1MDB.The announcement, made in a regulatory filing on Friday, shows how seriously Goldman is treating any role it may have had in fraud committed at 1MDB. Prosecutors in the U.S. and Malaysia are leading criminal investigations into 1MDB, and a former top deal maker at the firm has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Goldman says it’s cooperating with authorities.The WSJ calculates that Mr. Blankfein, who stepped down as chief executive of Goldman last year, might lose millions. And though Mr. Solomon wasn’t a top-ranking Goldman executive at the time, he could see some of his $23 million pay for last year clawed back as well. (Gary Cohn, who was Goldman’s No. 2 during the 1MDB work and received a lump payout when he left the firm in 2017, wouldn’t be affected.)In lighter Goldman news: Mr. Solomon, whose side hustle is DJing as DJ D-Sol, has released his second single, “Feel Alive.”Deutsche Bank refused Trump a loan in 2016For two decades, Deutsche Bank was the only major lender to give Donald Trump money, helping him finance his real estate operations. But when he sought a loan in early 2016 to help pay for a Scottish golf course — all while running for president — the German lender said no.More from David Enrich, Jesse Drucker and Ben Protess of the NYT:Senior officials at the bank, including its future chief executive, believed that Mr. Trump’s divisive candidacy made such a loan too risky, the people said. Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.What’s next: Expect House Democrats to include this in their investigation of Mr. Trump’s finances.More Deutsche Bank news: The lender reportedly scrambled to rid itself of a $600 million loan made to VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, in late 2016 as the German bank sought to reduce its exposure to Russian entities.How an S.U.V. became a Brexit warning signThe automaker Nissan confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned plans to build its new X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain and said that the car would be produced solely in Japan. It’s a blow for the British economy, and a clear signal that uncertainty over Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. is weighing on corporate minds.A clear culprit. “The continued uncertainty around the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” Nissan’s Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said in a statement. Greg Clark, Britain’s business secretary, told the FT that it was “a warning sign” about how much damage could be caused by a no-deal Brexit.Nissan is not alone. British C.F.O.s say that Brexit is currently the largest threat to their businesses. Some 78 percent of those surveyed said that the business environment in the nation would deteriorate if Britain left the E.U.What now? Prime Minister Theresa May is set to return to Brussels in the coming days in an attempt to redraft her Brexit deal. In the meantime, Bloomberg reports that she “will launch a new government working group intended to unite the feuding pro- and anti-Brexit factions” in her party.ImageA Shell processing plant near Wink, Tex.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe oil field that made American oil greatThe U.S. is now the top oil producer in the world, able to sway petroleum prices and breezily sanction Iran and Venezuela. The reason, as Cliff Krauss of the NYT notes: the Permian Basin, the heart of America’s shale industry.How big is it? It covers the same area as South Dakota, and produces four million barrels of oil a day — making it a bigger generator of oil than any member of OPEC other than Iraq and Saudi Arabia.What makes it special? It’s huge and rich in oil rather than in less-valuable natural gas. And it’s close to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.What could go wrong? Oil companies there might pump too much, drawing ire from OPEC. As Scott Sheffield, the chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, told the NYT: “You could have another price war.” And U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude could hurt American refineries, which can’t rely solely on the Permian.Hungry for ‘executive time’ in your calendar? Study Trump’s schedule and weepAxios has published almost three months of President Trump’s schedules after they were leaked, reportedly by somebody in the White House. Some highlights:• “Trump has spent around 60 percent of his scheduled time over the past three months in unstructured ‘Executive Time.’ ”• “He spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers,” six people with direct knowledge of his schedule told Axios.• “Trump’s first meeting of the day — usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. — is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff.”• “The president sometimes has meetings during Executive Time that he doesn’t want most West Wing staff to know about for fear of leaks. And his mornings sometimes include calls with heads of state, political meetings and meetings with counsel in the residence, which aren’t captured on these schedules.”Bonus: Axios also compared the schedules with those of Mr. Trump’s predecessors. He appears to share most in common with Bill Clinton’s early days in office.ImageThe Dude and Carrie Bradshaw in Stella Artois’s Super Bowl ad.CreditAgence France-Presse — Getty Images2019’s Super Bowl ads: nostalgia, wokeness and depressing techO.K., so the game itself may have been a slog to watch, and the halftime show was forgettable.

I’ve followed the investigation closely. Here’s what I’ll be looking for. By Quinta JurecicMs. Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare. March 9, 2019ImageRobert Mueller.CreditCreditCharles Dharapak/Associated PressAny week now, any day now — so the news reports go — the special counsel’s office will file the Mueller report.It will round out a trilogy. In 1974, to inform its impeachment proceedings, Congress received what became known as the “road map,” a terse document from the office of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski detailing evidence of wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon. In 1998, another investigator submitted a report on a president’s potentially impeachable offenses to Congress: a narrative from the independent counsel Kenneth Starr of Bill Clinton’s misconduct.Following Justice Department regulations, the special counsel Robert Mueller will submit a “confidential report” to the attorney general, Bill Barr. Mr. Barr will decide how much of it to share with Congress and with the world at large.Assuming that some significant portion of the report becomes public, and that it provides an additional factual record beyond what we already know, the question will quickly become how to identify any smoking guns. I’ve spent the last year and a half following the investigation. Here’s a partial list of what I’ll be looking for:The ‘Moscow Project’ In November 2015, according to Mr. Mueller, Michael Cohen, then Mr. Trump’s lawyer, was put in touch with a Russian man who promised Mr. Cohen “political synergy” and “repeatedly proposed a meeting” between Mr. Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to help with efforts to construct a Trump Tower Moscow. In January 2016, the office of a “high-level Russian official” — most likely, according to reports, of Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitri Peskov — reached out to Mr. Cohen about the project, and efforts on it continued at least into the summer of 2016.How closely were Mr. Trump and his children involved in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations, and over what period? How much did they know of or encourage Mr. Cohen’s contacts with the Russian government — including tentative plans for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin? How did the Trump family and campaign understand the connection between the “Moscow project” and Mr. Trump’s political ambitions?Mr. Mueller estimated in a court filing that Trump Tower Moscow could have generated “hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues” — an unusually large profit for the Trump Organization. Why was the number so atypically high? “Dirt” on ClintonIn spring 2016, according to the special counsel, a professor linked to the Russian government told the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Around this time, the special counsel’s indictment of Russian military intelligence officials shows that the Russian government had hacked into networks and accounts belonging to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, and would soon begin coordinating with WikiLeaks to disseminate the stolen information. In June, Donald Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in what seems to have been a failed effort to get similar “dirt.”Who else in the campaign did Mr. Papadopoulos tell about his scoop, and how high did that knowledge go? Did Donald Trump Jr. inform his father of his plans before the meeting? Roger Stone and WikiLeaksMr. Mueller’s indictment of the Trump adviser Roger Stone alleges that Mr. Stone worked throughout the summer of 2016 to get in touch with WikiLeaks and became aware of the organization’s plans to disclose hacked information. Mr. Cohen claimed in his testimony to Congress that he was in the room when Mr. Stone informed Mr. Trump that WikiLeaks was planning a “massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”Was Mr. Stone coordinating with the campaign in his efforts to get information from WikiLeaks? How much did Mr. Trump know about what Mr. Stone had found out? And who in the campaign, if anyone, might have been aware of separate efforts by the Republican operative Peter Smith to obtain additional Clinton emails from sources Mr. Smith believed were Russian hackers?Flynn’s Promises to Moscow The national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired just 24 days into his tenure over fallout from his transition-period contacts with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak — a matter about which he later pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. When he promised Mr. Kislyak that Mr. Trump would lift sanctions on Russia imposed by the departing Obama administration, was Mr. Flynn freelancing or was he acting on the instructions of someone higher?Russian Influence Operations Almost every case that Mr. Mueller has filed has illuminated a different facet of what appears to be a systematic, long-running effort by the government of Russia to reach out to Mr. Trump’s world. It’s clear that the Kremlin was attempting to gain access and influence. Was it also out-and-out working to recruit agents within the Trump Organization and campaign?On our side of the Atlantic, to what extent was that outreach welcomed and reciprocated by the Trump team, and to what extent was Mr. Trump a passive beneficiary? Did the Trump Organization and campaign understand and respond to those instances as manifestations of a systematic effort by the Russian government or as unrelated connections with unconnected Russians?Obstruction of JusticeMr. Mueller has also reportedly conducted an investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president: possible interference with the special counsel’s efforts, and with the F.B.I.’s before that. Mr. Barr, among others, has argued that action authorized by the Constitution — like dismissing the F.B.I. director — by definition cannot constitute obstruction. Will the report sidestep these tricky legal questions by showing efforts by Mr. Trump to derail the inquiry that fall plainly outside the scope of presidential authority? To what extent does the obstruction investigation overlap with the collusion investigation — meaning that the special counsel and the F.B.I. understood the president’s apparent efforts at obstruction as part of the troubling pattern of coordination with the Russian government that incited the investigation in the first place?What proportion of the Mueller report becomes public will hinge on many factors: how much classified information and grand jury material shielded from public disclosure it has; how much of it is arguably protected by executive privilege; to what extent it details criminal conduct, and to what extent Mr. Barr may reasonably argue that the Justice Department has an interest in protecting the privacy of those who are innocent.The Watergate “road map” first became available to the public in 2018, when a judge ordered it unsealed almost 45 years after it was handed over to Congress. The Starr Report, in contrast, was released within two days of its transmission to the legislature. With any luck, the time frame for release of the Mueller report will be closer to the latter than to the former.RelatedAnticipating the Mueller reportOpinion | Neal K.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|The Meaning of the Mueller ReportAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe Meaning of the Mueller ReportSo far it’s a vindication of the rule of law. Now the public needs to read it.By The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.March 22, 2019ImagePresident Trump at the White House on Friday.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesGive President Trump this much: In the face of the biggest existential threat to his presidency, the special counsel’s Russia investigation, he checked himself where it mattered most.Yes, his near-daily campaign to mock and discredit Robert Mueller’s “witch hunt” has now lasted longer than his campaign for the White House. His shameful, conspiratorial attacks on the “deep state,” and on the integrity of those who have devoted their lives to upholding the rule of law, have damaged the institutions of federal law enforcement and may have gotten him in even deeper trouble.Still, one persistent danger — that Mr. Trump would find a way to scuttle the investigation before it could be completed — never materialized. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Mueller, nearly two years after he was appointed to look into possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, delivered a full report of his findings and recommendations to the attorney general, as required by Justice Department regulations.Mr. Trump even joined a remarkably bipartisan House of Representatives, along with a vast majority of the American public, in calling for the release of Mr. Mueller’s report. “Let people see it,” he said on Wednesday. “There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing.”On the first point, we can all agree. William Barr, the attorney general, needs to release as much of Mr. Mueller’s work as he possibly can, and soon.We’ll reserve judgment on the second. It may prove that Mr. Trump has kept repeating his mantra of “no collusion” because it’s true. But even if Mr. Mueller has found in the end that Mr. Trump did not knowingly conspire with Russia — and it is profoundly to be hoped that the report settles that question, one way or the other — that doesn't mean this inquiry has been a witch hunt.Throughout the campaign and transition, Mr. Trump and many of his top officials and advisers had more than 100 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries. These contacts were apparently so unmemorable that many Trump advisers forgot all about them, even when asked under oath.Lying to federal officials is a crime, and at least four of Mr. Trump’s top aides (so far) have copped to doing it about their Russian contacts: Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser; Rick Gates, the deputy campaign chairman; George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser on the campaign; and Michael Cohen, the president’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer.Paul Manafort is also accused of lying repeatedly to investigators, but that’s the least of his problems. Mr. Manafort, who served as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for three months, is now serving seven-plus years in prison for money laundering and other crimes related to his years of lucrative work for political clients in Ukraine.And don’t forget Roger Stone, whose adventure through the justice system has only just begun. Mr. Stone, a longtime Trump adviser and political dirty trickster with roots going back to the Nixon administration, was arrested in January in an early-morning raid at his home and charged with multiple counts of false statements, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.Quite a team Mr. Trump surrounded himself with! And we haven’t even gotten to his son Donald Trump Jr., who needed no arm-twisting to accept a Russian offer of assistance during the campaign (“If it’s what you say I love it, especially later in the summer”), and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who seemed to have his hands in everything.At the heart of it all is Mr. Trump’s own behavior — his unexplained affection for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his knack for knowing just the right time to encourage election interference. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Mr. Trump, in a reference to Hillary Clinton’s emails, said on July 27, 2016 — the same day, as it happened, that the Russians began doing just that. (Last year, Mr. Mueller gained the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their role in hacking computer servers of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.)Then there are the times Mr. Trump interfered in the investigation himself — first urging then-F.B.I. director James Comey to drop the bureau’s investigation into Mr. Flynn, then firing Mr. Comey when he refused. Two days later, Mr. Trump said on national television that he’d fired Mr. Comey at least in part because of “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia.”This doesn’t count roughly a dozen other investigations into the president, several of which could ultimately expose him to even greater legal or political peril than Mr. Mueller’s. Most serious is the investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, which has already resulted in a three-year prison sentence for Mr. Cohen for his role in committing federal campaign-finance crimes to cover up hush-money payments to women claiming they had affairs with Mr. Trump — a cover-up that prosecutors say Mr. Trump aided after becoming president.Last month, Mr. Cohen spent some of his last moments as a free man testifying before Congress that Mr. Trump also lied during the campaign about negotiations to build a long-planned skyscraper in Moscow, which were continuing through much of 2016. Didn’t he worry that the lies could come back to hurt him? “He never expected to win the election,” Mr. Cohen said.Whether or not a sitting president can be indicted is a long-running debate among lawyers, but either way, Mr. Trump is sure to be under investigation for the rest of his term in office, and probably in court for the rest of his life.If he were less self-involved or paranoid, Mr. Trump would be grateful that his investigator was a man whose name is synonymous with integrity and fairness — and not, as the journalist Garrett Graff wrote, “the Democratic version of Ken Starr.”Whatever Mr. Trump’s reasons for doing the right thing and letting Mr. Mueller complete his work — bluffing, self-interest or resignation — they matter less than the fact that he did it. It may be a low bar, but given Mr. Trump’s demonstrated contempt for ideals of justice, it’s still something. No matter what Mr. Mueller’s efforts have turned up, the fact that he is now presenting his findings free of presidential interference is a bit of good news for the rule of law in America.Now all Americans deserve the chance to review those findings and reach their own conclusions.

Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller Investigation
By SCOTT SHANE and
GABRIELLA DEMCZUK
MARCH 21, 2019
Here are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.
By SCOTT SHANE Photographs by GABRIELLA DEMCZUK
It began with a trickle — curious developments that mostly raised more questions. There was evidence of election hacking — but could it really have been directed by the Kremlin? Certain Americans on Facebook, pitching for Donald J. Trump and stirring up anger, turned out to be impostors — but who had concocted them? One Trump campaign aide after another surfaced in sketchy reports of meetings with mysterious Russians — but did the encounters add up to anything significant?
Then there was the candidate’s famously twitchy Twitter finger, scathing toward so many public figures but oddly respectful of the Russian president. Was that a signal of dark secrets, or just of a soft spot for a strongman?
And so, in 2016, began the F.B.I.’s epic investigation — and the attempt by journalists to track it.
Questionnaire for National Security Positions.
The F.B.I’s interview with Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser.
The director of national intelligence released a report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election in January, 2017.
There are a thousand ways for reporters to inquire into the slow unfolding of a scandal, many of them producing mostly frustration. Making call after call to lawyers for those under investigation — and to their friends and frenemies, rivals and business associates. Scrutinizing a so-called dossier that makes shocking claims but offers little evidence sufficiently detailed to allow a true fact-check. Haunting congressional hearings and trailing the witnesses through the hallway mob scene afterward.
But if some F.B.I. inquiries are helpfully leaky for journalists, the special counsel’s investigation has proved hermetically sealed. Even so basic a question of when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, may deliver his report to the attorney general remains uncertain, the subject of many erroneous predictions.
If an investigation is a jigsaw puzzle, the mosaic of the two-year inquiry by Mr. Mueller remains incomplete, at least for the public and the press. We have seen major parts laid out in staggering detail in the 199 charges he has filed against 34 people and three companies — the only way Mr. Mueller, 74, a former F.B.I. director, has so far chosen to speak.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, recommended Mr. Comey’s firing.
President Trump fired Mr. Comey
The special counsel was appointed.
We know what keywords a particular Russian military intelligence hacker searched for on the web on a particular date. We know that “Putin’s niece,” introduced to a Trump campaign adviser by a suspicious professor, was not Putin’s niece. We know that a Trump Tower in Moscow, a longtime business dream of Mr. Trump, was still being secretly pursued even as the candidate took public stands that might please or offend Russia.
Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.
Senator Richard Burr, Chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
In that sense, the trickle has long since become a flood. The cast of characters has grown, and grown familiar — Flynn, Manafort, Cohen, Papadopoulos; the pattern of lying to investigators and Congress has become routine; the president’s shifting stories have become the norm. News coverage has become background noise, like a sea that periodically surges and retreats.
But for all of that, much of the investigation remains guesswork. We don’t know whether we know 90 percent or 50 percent or 20 percent of the findings. It is possible that Mr. Mueller’s team of aggressive prosecutors has already revealed virtually all of its work in public indictments and courtroom pronouncements. And it is also possible that the lawyers are hoarding shocking new information, disclosures capable of shaking the Trump presidency. We just don’t know.
Mr. Sessions
Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.
William P. Barr, the attorney general.
In a polarized country, with different news outlets offering divergent partisan spins, different factions fill the Mueller vacuum with radically different realities. Many Democrats, persuaded that the president has criminally obstructed justice, await final proof of “collusion” with Russia, the vague standard that has become a measure for Mr. Mueller’s ultimate findings.
The special counsel’s office indicted twelve Russians for interfering with the 2016 presidential election.
Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison.
Yet many of Mr. Trump’s supporters, drawing their information from other sources, believe the real story is something else entirely: enemies of Mr. Trump misused government agencies to spy on his campaign, then began a bogus investigation to undermine his presidency.
It is an alarming divide, not because the two sides harbor different opinions, but because they believe different sets of facts.
So the capital is on edge, snatching at the latest rumors about when the Mueller report might appear and what it might say. The sphinxlike special counsel keeps his counsel. The journalists troll for fresh scraps of inside information, and hope the end is coming soon.
The special counsel indicted Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer.
The Trump organization pursued real estate deals in Moscow.
Roger J. Stone, Mr. Trump’s former adviser, was indicted by the special counsel.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSunday ReviewSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperSunday Review|Release the Whole Mueller ReportAdvertisementOpinionSupported byRelease the Whole Mueller ReportCongress needs to be able to make its own assessment of the facts — and so do we.By Noah BookbinderMr. Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.March 22, 2019ImageRobert Mueller.CreditCreditJim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto AgencyWhen President Trump fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., on May 9, 2017, many Americans were justifiably worried that investigators would never be permitted to get to the bottom of Russia’s attack on our 2016 election and any potential involvement of Mr. Trump’s associates. Despite continued attempts by the president to impede the investigation, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has, in under two years, indicted dozens of Russians and Americans and submitted a report for review to Attorney General William Barr.Now that Mr. Mueller’s investigation is complete (or nearly complete), the Department of Justice must formally reveal its findings to Congress and the American people, which have separate and enormously consequential responsibilities of their own. These responsibilities cannot be carried out fully without direct access to the material that is in the report. Understanding this, the House of Representatives has already unanimously passed a resolution calling for the report’s release, and in recent polling vast majorities of Americans have agreed with this approach.The report that Mr. Mueller submitted to Mr. Barr for review should be viewed in combination with the remarkable assertions and conclusions that the special counsel has already reached in the form of indictments and guilty pleas of Trump associates and Russian nationals and organizations. Mr. Mueller and his team have already established that the Russian government engaged in a multipronged attack on our democracy. To review: Russian military intelligence officers hacked computers, networks and email accounts associated with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, and then released hacked material via WikiLeaks. Separately, Russians used fraudulent social media accounts to directly influence American opinions about the 2016 election. As the nation’s intelligence agencies and the Senate Intelligence Committee have separately concluded, these efforts were calculated to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president and to denigrate his opponent’s.For another viewOpinion | Caroline FredricksonWe Don’t Need to Read the Mueller ReportMarch 22, 2019We also know that senior members of the Trump campaign, including the president’s son, son-in-law and campaign chairman, met with Russians who promised “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. If there was in fact “no collusion,” as the president so often claims, it apparently was not for lack of trying. The special counsel has secured guilty pleas on serious federal felony charges from Trump associates, including Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; the deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates; a former national security adviser, Michael Flynn; a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos; and Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.What do all these men have in common? They lied to investigators about the nature of their relationships with foreign powers, and they worked for the Trump campaign. And that’s before we even start talking about Roger Stone.Regardless of whether efforts by Trump associates to coordinate with or benefit from interference by Russia or WikiLeaks were criminal, the fact that Mr. Trump and his campaign strategists sought to benefit from a foreign adversary’s efforts to undermine our democracy is one of the greatest breaches of public trust our country has ever witnessed. If Mr. Mueller ultimately determined that indicting the president’s associates for this conduct was not appropriate, that does not mean that there should not be consequences for this outrageous breach of trust.Though these and other findings have already been made public, many key questions remain. Chief among these is whether the special counsel found evidence that Mr. Trump obstructed justice by engaging in a pattern of conduct calculated to impede investigations of his campaign and his administration, including by firing Mr. Comey; attempting to force out the previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and pushing Mr. Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia inquiry; and potentially by dangling pardons to key defendants. Congress and the American people deserve to know the truth about the facts and circumstances of the president’s possibly obstructive acts. Obstruction of an investigation is not only criminal conduct, but also an affront to our system of government and the faith that the American people have in it.Equally important the report should begin to answer the crucial question that hangs over the entire Trump presidency: What did the president know and when did he know it? It is possible, for example, that Mr. Mueller may have uncovered evidence that Mr. Trump knew in advance of the numerous interactions between high-level campaign officials and Russian operatives, or that he knew of the plan to disseminate the hacked emails at strategically important times. This type of explosive revelation could indicate that the president was intentionally helping a malicious foreign power undermine our democracy. If the president knew about this conduct — and continued to protect and reward high-level intermediaries like Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort when he assumed office — the public could rightfully question his fitness to continue to serve as president.The report may also shed light on why the special counsel has apparently declined to indict Mr. Trump. That it is Department of Justice policy not to indict a sitting president is well known. Given that, Mr. Mueller may have decided that some of Mr. Trump’s conduct, while deeply concerning, unacceptable or even potentially illegal, did not rise to the level of a chargeable offense in the presidential context. In such circumstances, the Justice Department is functionally deferring to Congress’s primary jurisdiction over presidential accountability and should transmit to Congress whatever materials are relevant, particularly to potential abuses of power.That is precisely why the entire report must be made available not only to the public’s representatives in Congress, but also to the public as a whole. The responsibility for holding to account any bad actors identified in the report, President Trump included, now falls on the American people and Congress. Without direct access to Mr. Mueller’s full report, Congress cannot responsibly decide whether to exercise its powers of oversight or impeachment, and the American people will be unable to make a fully informed decision about whether Mr. Trump can be trusted with the high office he occupies.The report, and the findings and evidence supporting it, must be released.Related Opinion | The Editorial BoardThe Meaning of the Mueller ReportMarch 22, 2019Mueller Delivers Report on Trump-Russia Investigation to Attorney GeneralMarch 22, 2019Opinion | James ComeyJames Comey: What I Want From the Mueller ReportMarch 21, 2019Noah Bookbinder (@NoahBookbinder) is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Mueller III, has delivered a report on his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election to Attorney General William P. Barr. Mr. Barr will decide how much to make public and when.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Eileen SullivanMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — Now that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has provided Attorney General William P. Barr with a report about his investigation into Russia’s election interference, including whether any Trump associates coordinated with the Russians and whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice, what happens next is up to Mr. Barr.Here are five things to know about the man in possession of one of the most anticipated government documents in history.This is not Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general.William Pelham Barr served as an attorney general during the George Bush administration from 1991 to 1993, replacing Dick Thornburgh, who retired for a Senate run. After leaving the Justice Department at the end of the Bush administration, Mr. Barr worked as a corporate lawyer, mostly with the telecommunications company that eventually became Verizon.Born in New York, Mr. Barr, now 68, is married to a retired librarian, and together they have three daughters — all attorneys. One of his daughters and her husband now work at the Justice Department.[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]Mr. Barr’s views on executive power leave Mr. Trump with a nearly free hand.The Constitution, according to Mr. Barr’s interpretation, does not consider it a crime for the president to wield his executive powers corruptly, for instance by firing a subordinate or by pardoning a loyal aide. It is an interpretation favorable to Mr. Trump.ImageA Special Episode of ‘The Daily’: Robert Mueller Submits His ReportThe Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.michael barbaroSo what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?michael schmidtOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.michael barbaroIs that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?michael schmidtWe just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.michael barbaroSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.michael schmidtCorrect. And it’s a very difficult process, because if there is criminality in regards to the president, it’s a very tricky issue to navigate. The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can’t be indicted. But if the president can’t be indicted, Congress should deal with that behavior. How do you give that information to Congress? It’s not a snap decision you can make — like, O.K., Mueller’s done, this is what he found. Let’s put this in another box and send it to Congress. It’s far trickier.michael barbaroSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report?michael schmidtBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.michael barbaroAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend, in your mind, Mike, on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends?michael schmidtYes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.michael barbaroAnd on the other hand, if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president, how does Barr have to proceed?michael schmidtWell, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.michael barbaroIs it safe to say though, Mike, that if criminality is found by Mueller, Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found?michael schmidtMaybe. Maybe. But look, this is a highly unusual situation. The person who runs the executive branch, the president, has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months. Very awkward situation.michael barbaroAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president.michael schmidtCorrect. Has the job because the president put him there. So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says, well, how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts?michael barbaroSo when will we know more? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front?michael schmidtOh, now you want to know more.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] Yes, please.michael schmidtThe greed of the news business.michael barbaroIf you’ll indulge us.michael schmidtWhen will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.michael barbaroSo now we wait again.michael schmidtHurry up and wait.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroIn a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress sent on Friday afternoon, Attorney General William Barr said he would brief them on the major conclusions of the special counsel’s report as soon as this weekend. On Friday evening, The Times reported that Mueller is not recommending any new charges against President Trump or anyone else around him. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Monday.“He alone is the executive branch,” Mr. Barr wrote in an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memo. “As such, he is the sole repository of all Executive powers conferred by the Constitution.” The document appeared to criticize Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice.“Thus, the full measure of law enforcement authority is placed in the president’s hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds of cases subject to his control and supervision,” Mr. Barr wrote to senior officials at the Justice Department, months before Mr. Trump named him to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.Mr. Barr was considered for Mr. Trump’s legal defense team.Mr. Barr said during his confirmation hearing that he was approached, in June 2017, by an administration official who said he was looking for attorneys to add to the president’s defense team. Mr. Barr said he told the administration official he could not take on that role at the time, but he agreed to meet with Mr. Trump the next day.“It was a very brief meeting where essentially the president wanted to know — he said, ‘Oh, you know Bob Mueller. How well do you know Bob Mueller?’ ” Mr. Barr told senators during his January confirmation hearing. He left his phone number with the president at the end of the meeting. Mr. Barr added: “I didn’t hear — hear from him until, you know, later, but about something different, which was the attorney general position.”[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller are good friends.Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller have been friends for 30 years, dating back to their early days at the Justice Department, Mr. Barr told lawmakers in January. He said he applauded the appointment of Mr. Mueller to take over the Russia investigation. And even though he wrote an unsolicited memo that appeared to criticize parts of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, Mr. Barr said he expected their friendship to be intact after the investigation was over. (He also said he was not criticizing Mr. Mueller in his memo).Their families are friends, as well, Mr. Barr has said. Their wives went to Bible study together, and Mr. Mueller has been a guest at two of Mr. Barr’s daughters’s weddings.Mr. Barr once defended Mr. Trump’s calls for new investigations into Clinton.In November 2017, Mr. Barr said there was “nothing inherently wrong about a president calling for an investigation.” He cautioned that such an investigation should only be launched if the “matter warrants investigation,” and not just because Mr. Trump wanted it.The attorney general at the time, Mr. Sessions, assigned a group of senior Justice Department lawyers to look into some of the accusations and report back on whether a special counsel should be appointed to pursue an inquiry. The Justice Department has not opened one.Correction: March 25, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated William Barr’s age.

The special counsel submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday.CreditCreditJoshua Roberts/ReutersPeople lie to hide the truth. They lie to hide crimes. And while everyone is dying for a peek at Robert Mueller’s bombshell report to see if he says any crimes were committed by the Trump campaign in 2016, the truth is actually already out there, hidden in plain sight.Mr. Mueller’s report may never go public, but we don’t need a peek at the recommendations he delivered on Friday to Attorney General William Barr to credibly assess that something unethical and likely illegal went on in 2016. The repeated lies told by Trump campaign staff members — lies about their connections to Russian figures — already spin a grand tale of conspiracy and deceit. And it’s a tale so suspect and sordid that President Trump and his associates felt the need to lie to hide it from law enforcement.This is not conjecture; some of Mr. Trump’s people are already in jail, having been convicted in federal court for lying to investigators about their connections to and interactions with Russians during the 2016 campaign. Others have pleaded guilty to similar crimes, which — it bears repeating — is what one does when presented with overwhelming evidence of one’s guilt. Still others await trial. Many more have been indicted.There’s the top Trump campaign official Paul Manafort, who is serving time for lying about his history of lobbying for Russian interests and sharing Trump campaign polling data with a Russian intelligence asset during the campaign.And there’s the close Trump associate Roger Stone, recently indicted on charges of lying about communications he had with Wikileaks before it released damaging information about Hillary Clinton that law enforcement believes was stolen by Russian hackers.The former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is headed to jail after admitting that he lied to Congress about a business deal Mr. Trump was pursuing with Russian figures throughout the 2016 campaign, lies Mr. Trump himself echoed on the campaign trail.For another viewOpinion | Noah BookbinderRelease the Whole Mueller ReportMarch 22, 2019Michael Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, will soon be doing time after admitting to making false statements to the F.B.I. to conceal December 2016 communications with Russia regarding the sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama administration.Lastly, there is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, who arguably helped precipitate the investigation when he bragged about his knowledge of Russian “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton to an Australian diplomat who then alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Papadopoulos subsequently pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and served time in prison.Then there is the president himself.From the outset, Mr. Trump’s approach to the Mueller investigation has been characterized by paranoia and fear. With his increasingly shrill denials, the president comes across more as someone who fears he will be found out than someone convinced of his innocence.And he has lied to the American people.The president’s version of events regarding his campaign’s interactions with Russia has changed repeatedly since the investigation began. From early assertions during his campaign that he had no business interests in Russia, to claims about his role in issuing false statements about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russians, the president has been caught in numerous, verifiable lies on this issue. It just remains to be seen whether he lied to cover up actual criminal activity, including conspiring with a foreign power to sway an election, or working to obstruct investigations into those ties.Ideally, Mr. Barr will share Mr. Mueller’s report with the country. But if he elects to withhold it, President Trump will no doubt claim victory. He will no doubt treat the absence of an indictment as full vindication. But here’s a truth for the president: He was never going to be indicted. The Department of Justice has a longstanding policy against indicting a sitting president, and the absence of an indictment does not mean no evidence of conspiracy or obstruction was found.ImageRobert MuellerCreditTom Williams/CQ Roll CallIndeed, Mr. Mueller’s report may not be the end of the president’s legal peril, only the beginning. That’s because report or no report, through his prosecutions, referrals, indictments, convictions and subpoenas, Mr. Mueller has already provided the House of Representative with some very clear paths for investigation. So even if the Mueller report simply gets tossed in a drawer in Mr. Barr’s desk for all eternity, there is already sufficient material out there to let the House exercise its newly rediscovered oversight responsibilities and get to the bottom of what happened between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Remember, Richard Nixon was not indicted, and there was no commensurate special counsel report in the Watergate scandal. There doesn’t need to be one here to right wrongs so egregious they were apparently worth lying about.RelatedOpinion | The Editorial BoardThe Meaning of the Mueller ReportMarch 22, 2019Mueller Delivers Report on Trump-Russia Investigation to Attorney GeneralMarch 22, 2019Opinion | James ComeyJames Comey: What I Want From the Mueller ReportMarch 21, 2019Opinion | Noah BookbinderRelease the Whole Mueller ReportMarch 22, 2019Caroline Fredrickson (@crfredrickson) is the president of the American Constitution Society and author of “Under the Bus: How Working Women Are Being Run Over” and the forthcoming “The Democracy Fix: How to Win the Fight for Fair Rules, Fair Courts and Fair Elections.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|James Comey: What I Want From the Mueller ReportAdvertisementOpinionSupported byJames Comey: What I Want From the Mueller ReportI am rooting for a demonstration to the world that the United States justice system works.By James ComeyMr. Comey is a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.March 21, 2019阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版Image CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesThe country is eagerly awaiting the special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Many people know what they want it to say — what they feel it simply must say — namely, that Donald Trump is a criminal who should be removed from office. Or that he is completely innocent of all wrongdoing.But not everyone knows what it “must” say. Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be president of the United States, I’m not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal. I’m also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to “clear” the president. I’m not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charging and report on his work.President Trump’s constant attacks on the special counsel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department over the past two years raised the prospect that he would interfere to stop the special counsel’s work. It is deeply concerning that the president of the United States would try to protect himself by torching the institutions of justice. But he hasn’t used his authority to end Mr. Mueller’s work. (That would have been a crisis of a different order — shutting down the investigation, rather than just trying to undermine its credibility.) So we are in a position to wonder and hope about the report’s content.Wondering is fine. But hoping for a particular answer is not. The rule of law depends upon fair administration of justice, which is rooted in complete and unbiased investigation. We are best served when an investigation finds all relevant facts and illuminates the fullest possible view of the truth.More on Robert MuellerOpinion | Neal K. KatyalThe Mueller Report Is Coming. Here’s What to Expect.Feb. 21, 2019I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians in connection with the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also don’t care. I care only that the work be done, well and completely. If it is, justice will have prevailed and core American values will have been protected at a time when so much of our national leadership has abandoned its commitment to truth and the rule of law.I am rooting for a demonstration to the world — and maybe most of all to our president and his enablers — that the United States has a justice system that works because there are people who believe in it and rise above personal interest and tribalism. That system may reach conclusions they like or it may not, but the apolitical administration of justice is the beating heart of this country. I hope we all get to see that.The interests of justice will also be best served by maximum transparency about the special counsel’s work. I don’t know all the considerations that will go into deciding precisely what to say about the completion of that work and when to say it. But because the Department of Justice is guided first and always by the public interest, it should provide details about finished investigations when the public needs to know them, as it traditionally has.I do have one hope that I should confess. I hope that Mr. Trump is not impeached and removed from office before the end of his term. I don’t mean that Congress shouldn’t move ahead with the process of impeachment governed by our Constitution, if Congress thinks the provable facts are there. I just hope it doesn’t. Because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country.Critics of Mr. Trump should hope for something much harder to distort, or to nurse as a grievance, than an impeachment. We need a resounding election result in 2020, where Americans of all stripes, divided as they may be about important policy issues — immigration, guns, abortion, climate change, regulation, taxes — take a moment from their busy lives to show that they are united by something even more important: the belief that the president of the United States cannot be a chronic liar who repeatedly attacks the rule of law. Then we can get back to policy disagreements.I just hope we are up to it.More by James ComeyOpinion | James Comey: James Comey: Let’s Vote to Uphold Our Nation’s ValuesNov. 6, 2018Opinion | James Comey: James Comey: The F.B.I.

Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Sharon LaFraniere and Katie BennerMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, on Friday delivered a report on his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election to Attorney General William P. Barr, bringing to a close an investigation that has consumed the nation and cast a shadow over President Trump for nearly two years.Mr. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter that he may brief them on the special counsel’s “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend, a surprisingly fast turnaround for a report anticipated for months. The attorney general said he “remained committed to as much transparency as possible.”In an apparent endorsement of an investigation that Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked as a “witch hunt,” Mr. Barr said Justice Department officials never had to intervene to keep Mr. Mueller from taking an inappropriate or unwarranted step. The department’s regulations would have required Mr. Barr to inform the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees about any such interventions in his letter.A senior Justice Department official said that Mr. Mueller would not recommend new indictments, a statement aimed at ending speculation that Mr. Trump or other key figures might be charged down the line. With department officials emphasizing that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry was over and his office closing, the question for both Mr. Trump’s critics and defenders was whether the prosecutors condemned the president’s behavior in their report, exonerated him — or neither. The president’s lawyers were already girding for a possible fight over whether they could assert executive privilege to keep parts of the report secret.[Update: Read Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the Mueller Report.]Since Mr. Mueller’s appointment in May 2017, his team has focused on how Russian operatives sought to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race and whether anyone tied to the Trump campaign, wittingly or unwittingly, cooperated with them. While the inquiry, started months earlier by the F.B.I., unearthed a far-ranging Russian influence operation, no public evidence emerged that the president or his aides illegally assisted it.Nonetheless, the damage to Mr. Trump and those in his circle has been extensive. A half-dozen former Trump aides were indicted or convicted of crimes, mostly for lying to federal investigators or Congress. Others remain under investigation in cases that Mr. Mueller’s office handed off to federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere. Dozens of Russian intelligence officers or citizens, along with three Russian companies, were charged in cases that are likely to languish in court because the defendants cannot be extradited to the United States.ImageThe letter that William P. Barr, the attorney general, sent to Congress.Republicans immediately seized upon the news that no more indictments are expected as a vindication of Mr. Trump and his campaign. Those reports “confirm what we’ve known all along: There was never any collusion with Russia,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-highest-ranking House Republican, said in a statement.Democrats, including some of those hoping to supplant Mr. Trump in the White House in the 2020 election, insisted that Mr. Mueller’s full report be made public, including the underlying evidence. In a joint statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, warned Mr. Barr not to allow the White House a “sneak preview” of the document.“The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,” they said.Not since Watergate has a special prosecutor’s inquiry so mesmerized the American public. Polls have shown that most Americans want to know its findings, and the House unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution to publicize the report.Mr. Barr’s letter said he would decide what to release after consulting with Mr. Mueller and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has overseen his investigation. Justice Department officials emphasized that the White House had been kept at a distance.Only a handful of law enforcement officials have seen the report, said Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Although a White House lawyer was notified that Mr. Mueller had delivered it to Mr. Barr, no White House official has seen the report or been briefed on it, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,” she said.Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s personal lawyers, said he planned to remain in Washington over the weekend in part because Mr. Barr might update Congress on Mr. Mueller’s findings.He sidestepped a question about whether the president’s lawyers were seeking to review the report before any of it becomes public. White House lawyers have been preparing for the possibility they may need to argue some material is protected by executive privilege, especially if the report discusses whether the president’s interactions with his top aides or legal advisers are evidence of obstruction of justice.Even though Mr. Mueller’s report is complete, some aspects of his inquiry remain active and may be overseen by the same prosecutors once they are reassigned to their old jobs in the Justice Department. For instance, recently filed court documents suggest that investigators are still examining why the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort turned over campaign polling data in 2016 to a Russian associate who prosecutors said was tied to Russian intelligence.Mr. Mueller looked extensively at whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice to protect himself or his associates. But despite months of negotiations, prosecutors were unable to personally interview the president.Mr. Trump’s lawyers insisted that he respond only to written questions from the special counsel. Even though under current Justice Department policy, a sitting president cannot be indicted, Mr. Trump’s lawyers worried that his responses in an oral interview could bring political repercussions, including impeachment, or put him in legal jeopardy once he is out of office.ImageA Special Episode of ‘The Daily’: Robert Mueller Submits His ReportThe Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general.

Mikey, what do you know?dean baquetDo you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get?michael schmidtMy guess is not a lot because I don’t know what there is to get a heads-up on.michael schmidtAnd I said, I don’t know.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] You tell them that you don’t know.michael schmidtWe don’t know!dean baquetO.K.elisabeth bumillerThat’s what we got.michael schmidtSo that’s all we got.elisabeth bumillerAnd we have stories ready. Once we get the word from Justice, we just push a button.michael schmidtAll the work is done.elisabeth bumillerWe’re just tourists hanging around.michael schmidtWe’re sort of lemmings at this point.michael schmidtSo it’s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts.michael barbaro[LAUGHS]michael schmidtAnd then it happens.archived recordingThe special counsel investigation is over. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.michael barbaroSo what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?michael schmidtOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.michael barbaroIs that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?michael schmidtWe just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.michael barbaroSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.michael schmidtCorrect. And it’s a very difficult process, because if there is criminality in regards to the president, it’s a very tricky issue to navigate. The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can’t be indicted. But if the president can’t be indicted, Congress should deal with that behavior. How do you give that information to Congress? It’s not a snap decision you can make — like, O.K., Mueller’s done, this is what he found. Let’s put this in another box and send it to Congress. It’s far trickier.michael barbaroSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report?michael schmidtBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.michael barbaroAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend, in your mind, Mike, on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends?michael schmidtYes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.michael barbaroAnd on the other hand, if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president, how does Barr have to proceed?michael schmidtWell, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.michael barbaroIs it safe to say though, Mike, that if criminality is found by Mueller, Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found?michael schmidtMaybe. Maybe. But look, this is a highly unusual situation. The person who runs the executive branch, the president, has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months. Very awkward situation.michael barbaroAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president.michael schmidtCorrect. Has the job because the president put him there. So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says, well, how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts?michael barbaroSo when will we know more? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front?michael schmidtOh, now you want to know more.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] Yes, please.michael schmidtThe greed of the news business.michael barbaroIf you’ll indulge us.michael schmidtWhen will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.michael barbaroSo now we wait again.michael schmidtHurry up and wait.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroIn a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress sent on Friday afternoon, Attorney General William Barr said he would brief them on the major conclusions of the special counsel’s report as soon as this weekend. On Friday evening, The Times reported that Mueller is not recommending any new charges against President Trump or anyone else around him. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Monday.Mr. Trump has helped make Mr. Mueller a household name, attacking his investigation an average of about twice a day as an unfair, politically motivated attempt to invalidate his election. He never forgave former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry, an action that cleared the way for his deputy, Mr. Rosenstein, to appoint Mr. Mueller.Mr. Trump reiterated his attacks on the special counsel this week, saying Mr. Mueller decided “out of the blue” to write a report, ignoring that regulations require him to do so. But the president also said the report should be made public because of “tens of millions” of Americans would want to know what it contains.“Let people see it,” Mr. Trump said. “There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing.”In court, the evidence amassed by the Mueller team has held up. Every defendant who is not still awaiting trial either pleaded guilty or was convicted by a jury. Although no American has been charged with illegally plotting with the Russians to tilt the election, Mr. Mueller uncovered a web of lies by former Trump aides.Five of them were found to have deceived federal investigators or Congress about their interactions with Russians during the campaign or the transition. They include Mr. Manafort; Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser; and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and longtime fixer. A sixth former adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., is to stand trial in November on charges of lying to Congress.Those who know Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, had predicted a concise, legalistic report devoid of opinions — nothing like the 445-page treatise that Ken Starr, who investigated President Bill Clinton, produced in 1998. Operating under a now-defunct statute that governed independent counsels, Mr. Starr had far more leeway than Mr. Mueller to set his own investigative boundaries and to render judgments.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The regulations that governed Mr. Mueller, who is under the supervision of the Justice Department, only required him to explain his decisions to either seek or decline to seek criminal charges in a confidential report to the attorney general. The attorney general was then required to notify the leadership of the House and Senate judiciary committees.Despite pledging transparency, Mr. Barr may be reluctant to release the part of Mr. Mueller’s report that may be of most interest: whom the special counsel declined to prosecute and why, especially if Mr. Trump is on that list.The department’s longstanding practice, with rare exceptions, is not to identify people who were merely investigative targets to avoid unfairly tainting their reputations, especially because they would have no chance to defend themselves in a court of law. Mr. Rosenstein, who has overseen Mr. Mueller’s work and may have a say in what is released, is a firm believer in that principle.In a May 2017 letter that the president seized upon as justification for his decision to fire James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, Mr. Rosenstein severely criticized Mr. Comey for announcing during the previous year that Hillary Clinton, then a presidential candidate, would not be charged with a crime for mishandling classified information as secretary of state. Releasing “derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,” Mr. Rosenstein wrote, is “a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.”Weighing that principle against the public’s right to know is even more fraught in the president’s case. If Mr. Mueller declined to pursue criminal charges against Mr. Trump, he might have been guided not by lack of evidence, but by the Justice Department’s legal opinions that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The department’s Office of Legal Counsel has repeatedly advised that the stigma and burden of being under prosecution would damage the president’s ability to lead.Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the head of the House Judiciary Committee, has argued that the department’s view that presidents are protected from prosecution makes it all the more important for the public to see Mr. Mueller’s report.“To maintain that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the president cannot be charged, is to convert D.O.J. policy into the means for a cover-up,” he said before the House approved its nonbinding resolution to disclose the special counsel’s findings.Some predict that any disclosures from Mr. Mueller’s report will satisfy neither Mr. Trump’s critics nor his defenders, especially given the public’s high expectations for answers. A Washington Post-Schar School poll in February illustrated the sharp divide in public opinion: It found that of those surveyed, most Republicans did not believe evidence of crimes that Mr. Mueller’s team had already proved in court, while most Democrats believed he had proved crimes that he had not even claimed.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.

Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Publishers have already begun taking orders for a report that he is expected to produce, despite no one knowing when that will happen or how much, if any, will be made public.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Tiffany HsuMarch 7, 2019The legions of reporters and commentators following every move by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, do not know when he will finish investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. And it is unclear whether the report he is expected to file will ever become public.That hasn’t stopped two publishers from setting a date, March 26, for when people can buy their book versions of the eagerly anticipated document. One online outlet is already describing one of those books as a bona fide hit.Amazon’s listing for “The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia and Collusion,” carries a “best seller” label based on pre-orders. On Barnes & Noble’s website, the publisher Skyhorse is promoting the $9.40 paperback — with Mr. Mueller and the Department of Justice as authors — as “required reading.”For $10.50, readers can also put in an advanced order for “The Mueller Report” from The Washington Post and the Simon & Schuster imprint Scribner, which bills the report as “the most anticipated investigative document of this century.”The question of when Mr. Mueller will file his report has been a topic of heated speculation for some time, with the fever rising in recent weeks. But his investigation is among the most tightly guarded government operations in memory. The “Game of Thrones” series finale probably has a better chance of being leaked than details from inside Mr. Mueller’s inquiry.Do the publishers know something everyone else doesn’t?It turns out, they do not. The publishing date for the Skyhorse book is “fluid,” Nick Magliato, a project editor for the company, said on Thursday. To clear up any confusion, the company plans to add a note specifying that the listed date is only a placeholder.Mr. Magliato said those working on the Skyhorse project initially thought the Mueller report would
come this week, giving them time to read, typeset and print a hard copy by March 26, with an e-book available in under 48 hours.What if Attorney General William P. Barr chooses not to make large parts of it public? Will buyers of the Skyhorse book, listed at 960 pages, receive something the size of “Gone With the Wind” with many pages of shruggie emoticons? Or will the book perhaps be similar to another title now available on Amazon, “A Comprehensive Review of the Lies in the Mueller Report: Exhaustive Analysis of Each and Every Specific Lie,” which features more than 100 blank pages.ImageA preorder page for “The Mueller Report” on Amazon.com.The listed page count of Skyhorse’s book “is a complete guess” and is subject to change, Mr. Magliato said.And if the contents of the report are kept entirely confidential?“Then we don’t publish it, unfortunately,” Mr. Magliato said. Advance orders would be canceled and payments refunded, he said. (That happened, he said, when the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos lost his book deal with Simon & Schuster in 2017).Brian Belfiglio, Scribner’s publicity director, said his company had also settled on March 26 as a placeholder date for The Post’s book because retailers planning to sell it wanted something specific for their online listings. If the report is made public sooner, he said, the book will be published sooner. If the results are delayed, the sale date will be pushed back.The Post plans to supplement its version with reporting and commentary by the newspaper’s reporters. In a statement, Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said the book would help “in providing context and perspective” during “a supremely important moment in American history.”Skyhorse, an independent publisher, has lined up Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor whose criticism of Mr. Mueller’s investigation has won him
praise from President Trump and disdain from the Martha’s Vineyard elite, to write an introduction. The publisher, whose recent titles include books about WikiLeaks, the video game Fortnite, slow cooker recipes and a sloth, previously published Mr. Dershowitz’s book “The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump.”The Skyhorse website’s page has a section for reviews, which includes this blurb from the journalist Dan Rather: “There’s never been anything like this in American history.” The website does not say the quote is from a CNN segment in August, or that he was talking about President Trump’s political and legal problems.Despite being listed by Skyhorse as an author, Mr. Mueller would not receive any profits from a book bearing his name. Under federal law, work prepared by United States government is in the public domain.Books based on government reports are not unusual, and they sometimes gain commercial success.In 1998, The Post and the publisher Public Affairs released “The Starr Report: The Findings of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair,” a paperback version of the report prepared by Mr. Starr, the independent counsel.The book, along with two other editions, hit the top of The New York Times’s best-seller list when it was released, said Jaime Leifer, the publicity director for PublicAffairs. It has sold 160,000 copies to date.Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.Yes, I know you’ve heard this before, but many observers think it’s finally true: The Mueller report seems to be coming soon. I want to step back this morning and review what Robert’s Mueller investigation (and others) have already uncovered.The brief version: So far, there is no clear evidence that the Trump campaign and Russian officials worked together to coordinate campaign strategy. Trump and his defenders have tried to conflate this with innocence. The president’s mantra is “No collusion.”[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]But that’s both wrong and a brazen lowering of the bar for presidential behavior. Even without any further findings, the Mueller investigation shows that Trump has repeatedly violated his oath of office by lying to the American people, breaking the law, putting his personal interests above the country’s and secretly working with a hostile foreign country. The details:Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. Russian officials hacked the emails of Democratic officials and created a social media campaign designed to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump.Trump campaign officials knew of these foreign efforts and encouraged them. The president’s son did so. As did George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser. And Trump himself publicly urged Russia to hack Clinton’s emails — on the same day Russian hackers tried to breach her private server for the first time.Trump campaign officials attempted to conceal contacts they had with Russians and other foreign officials. Trump and his associates repeatedly lied to the public and to investigators about their more than 100 contacts — including meetings, phone calls and emails — with Russians during the campaign. Among the examples: Michael Flynn, a campaign aide who became Trump’s national security adviser, lied about phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States.Campaign officials knew in advance about the WikiLeaks email dumps. Before WikiLeaks released stolen Democratic emails, Roger Stone, a longtime Trump associate, told campaign officials it would happen.Trump was secretly pursuing a business venture in Russia and lied about it. During most of the 2016 campaign, Trump associates worked to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, while publicly denying any such business relationship. Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, lied to Congress about the talks and was sentenced to three years in prison.Trump directed a subordinate to break the law. During the campaign, Trump directed Cohen to pay hush money to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. The secret payments violated campaign finance laws.Trump’s campaign was run by criminals. The Mueller investigation has also uncovered separate financial crimes committed by top campaign officials. Both Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, a Manafort protégé, have been indicted on conspiracy and fraud. Others tied to the campaign, including Papadopoulos, have also received prison sentences.For more:In a Times Op-Ed, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, writes that he hopes the Mueller report shows that Trump did not hinder the investigation.My newsroom colleagues Larry Buchanan and Karen Yourish have put together a helpful guide to the people implicated in the investigation. FiveThirtyEight’s Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Perry Bacon Jr. note that Mueller’s court filings so far amount to a kind of public report.Neal Katyal, a legal expert, has also put together a helpful Twitter thread on the subject. “Don’t focus on the one-line spin. Focus on the facts, judgments, and limitations in the Mueller Report,” he writes.The legal scholar Joyce White Vance notes that the end of the Mueller investigation doesn’t necessarily mean the end of Trump’s legal issues. “Mueller appears to have stayed carefully within his lane, sending cases that strayed from his core mission to US attorneys & DOJ divisions,” she tweeted. “These career prosecutors will work their investigations to a conclusion, even after Mueller closes shop.”And Aaron Blake of The Washington Post outlines what could happen to Mueller’s report once the attorney general has it.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Barr informed congressional leaders that the special counsel’s investigation has concluded.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesMarch 22, 2019Attorney General William P. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter late Friday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delivered a report to the Department of Justice. See the letter here and read a transcript below.[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]________________________Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attorney General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department’s long-standing practices and policies. I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review.Finally, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of” this notification “would be in the public interest.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(c).

Although Mr. Trump has repeatedly referred in all caps to the special counsel investigation as a “WITCH HUNT,” his White House has done little to prepare for the findings.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos and Noah WeilandMarch 12, 2019WASHINGTON — Television crews have been positioned outside the offices of the special counsel, the federal courthouse and, at least before they were asked to leave, the McLean, Va., home of the new attorney general, William P. Barr.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are so desperate for hints that they are asking aides to call Justice Department contacts to beg for morsels.Publishing houses are scrambling to produce instant books of the findings. Newspapers are deploying small armies of reporters. At bars, restaurants, cocktail parties and street corners, people are asking one another the same question.When is it coming out?Washington — jittery, full of rumor, like a becalmed ship in the dead air before a coming storm — is waiting for the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his aides conspired in the effort or obstructed justice. It may or may not be the report of the century, it may or may not be ready soon, and it may be only a few pages long. But it is unquestionably one of the capital’s most anticipated documents since the Starr Report on President Bill Clinton arrived by the truckload on Capitol Hill in September 1998.Real information — actually, any information at all from Mr. Mueller’s astonishingly leak-free team — is almost nonexistent. “The folks who know aren’t talking, and the folks who don’t won’t stop,” said Antonia Ferrier, the former communications director for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.The result is energetic spinning from both parties, who have stepped into the void to try to frame the next chapter of Mr. Trump’s presidency.Democrats, worried that Mr. Mueller’s report will be a dud, are now casting it as one step in their coming investigations of a presidency flush with accusations of wrongdoing. They say the House, which they control, has a duty to conduct oversight, regardless of what the special counsel concludes.“I have the utmost respect for Mr. Mueller; I am accepting of whatever he brings,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. “But that cannot be the end of it.”ImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, at the White House last week. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, will deliver his report to Mr. Barr when his investigation concludes.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesAs they wait, House Democrats are playing down talk of impeachment in favor of new congressional investigations that can absorb Mr. Mueller’s findings and provide continued scrutiny if the president is cleared. Their topics are familiar: Russian contacts, obstruction of justice, abuse of power and a scheme to buy the silence of a pornographic film actress who claimed an affair with Mr. Trump.“The mission of the House of Representatives is very different than Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation,” said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California and a member of the Judiciary Committee, the body where any impeachment proceedings would begin.Mr. Lieu said House Democrats would reject the premise that Mr. Mueller’s clearing Mr. Trump of personal coordination with the Russians would amount to any broader exoneration.“Just because he is cleared of one,” Mr. Lieu said, “doesn’t mean he is cleared of nine other ones.”The president and his allies are continuing to label the investigation an overreach — Mr. Trump prefers to refer to it in all caps as a WITCH HUNT — and have kept the bar for wrongdoing very high. Outwardly confident that Mr. Mueller will not find evidence of a conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Russia, they have routinely sought to reduce Mr. Mueller’s investigation to a single term — “collusion” — or bust.Anything short of that, including a charge of obstruction of justice, they insist, would justify having the whole inquiry dismissed.“If Mueller could not find anything with his overzealous but skilled, relentless investigators, the F.B.I., a grand jury and a discipline which is unknown to a congressional group, then multiple House Democratic committees will not be a search for the truth but a forum to launch attacks on the president,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, wrote in a text message over the weekend. As for acts that could be called obstruction of justice, Mr. Trump was rightfully exercising powers granted by the constitution, Mr. Giuliani added.As the president left the White House for Alabama and then his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last weekend, he made his confidence known. “Keep the hoax going,” he told reporters before heading into Marine One. “It’s just a hoax.”Republicans in Congress, while privately worried that Mr. Mueller could still deliver an unpleasant surprise, have provided backup. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, rounded up reporters on Friday to say that Democrats were launching a “fishing expedition” because they “don’t believe they are going to get what they’ve been asking for — and dying for — for two years.”In the meantime, guessing has dominated social gatherings in Washington, where debate over precedent often bounces from Whitewater to Watergate.ImageSupporters of impeaching Mr. Trump in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office last week.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesOn Monday night hundreds of people crowded into the Bier Baron Tavern near Dupont Circle to sip brews as Randall D. Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at nearby George Washington University, lectured on the Mueller investigation and presented a slide show with pub trivia. (Q: Who was the Russian charged as a co-defendant with Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, for witness tampering? A: Konstantin V. Kilimnik.) Mr. Eliason also played down any expectations that the president would be indicted or that the entirety of Mr. Mueller’s report would be available to ordinary citizens.“If you don’t charge somebody, you don’t write a report about it and release it to the public,” Mr. Eliason said. “That’s just not the way the Justice Department is supposed to work.”A mile up Florida Avenue in the busy Adams Morgan neighborhood, Lee Farmer, a city planner, and Elizabeth Rairigh, a historic preservationist, were drinking wine at the Jack Rose Dining Saloon, both worn out by constant news of the report’s coming release.“I have this constant anticipation of something,” Ms. Rairigh said. “Every day I’m disappointed.”Ms. Farmer said she recently gave up cable news — an improvement, she joked, for her mental health. She added of the report, “I’ll find out before I die.”On that topic,
an NPR report last week suggested that some elderly anti-Trump Americans have taken that sentiment seriously and are trying to stay alive until Mr. Mueller’s work is done.Inside the White House, preparation has not been much more extensive.There is no war room preparing to deal with Mr. Mueller’s findings and no intention to set one up, as Mr. Clinton did when he faced impeachment and possible removal from office. There are no calls with surrogates to line up a messaging plan. The president’s advisers are simply flying blind, said one person directly involved in the planning, who was not authorized to discuss it.Their problem is familiar. White House officials do not know for certain that the report will be sent to the White House for review for executive privilege issues before it is submitted to the Justice Department, not to mention what it will say.For those caught up in the special counsel investigation, the wait is even more freighted.“My family’s life has been on pause for two years, and we have been waiting to press play ever since the rumors of the end of the investigation,” said Michael R. Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who was questioned by Mr. Mueller’s team.The scrutiny has cost Mr. Caputo business and significant legal fees, he said, but he expressed optimism that the release of Mr. Mueller’s findings will allow him to move on.“So make with the report already,” he said.Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Zach Montague and Kenneth P.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|William Barr Hopes to Update Lawmakers on Mueller Report This WeekendAdvertisementSupported byWilliam Barr Hopes to Update Lawmakers on Mueller Report This WeekendThe attorney general, William P. Barr, will determine how much of the special counsel’s Russia report will be shared with Congress or the public. By Michael Tackett and Eileen SullivanThe delivery of a report late Friday afternoon from Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to Attorney General William P. Barr might seem like the conclusion of a long-running drama, but it is only the end of the beginning. Mr. Mueller is not recommending any new charges be filed, a Justice Department official said, but lawmakers conducting their own inquiries will still be able to refer criminal charges to the department.Top members of Congress, and several Democratic presidential candidates, urged Mr. Barr to quickly release as much information as possible. In a letter, Mr. Barr told lawmakers he might be able to share “principal conclusions” of the report this weekend.Mr. Barr will decide how much of the report to release to Congress or the public, and where the case of Russian election interference goes.“The White House has not received or been briefed on the special counsel’s report,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.ImageAttorney General William P. Barr said he would consult with Mr. Mueller and the deputy attorney general about what other information from the report can be released.CreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesNo new charges are recommended, a Justice Department official says.Mr. Mueller did not suggest additional charges as part of his investigation, when he delivered his findings to Mr. Barr on Friday. This caps the special counsel’s charges at 199, filed against 34 people and three companies.The “principal conclusions” of the special counsel investigation, which Mr. Barr said he might be able to share with lawmakers in the coming days, are not likely to include many details. In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Barr said he would consult with Mr. Mueller and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, about what other information from the report can be released.The investigation is over. Now what?Mr. Mueller’s report could be brief or several hundred pages. It is now up to Mr. Barr to decide how much of it to share with Congress, and when.The late Friday afternoon news dump in Washington is typically reserved space by those wishing to bury bad news. In the case of Mr. Mueller’s report, bad news is most assuredly in the eye of the beholder. In a brief interview, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was circumspect about what comes next. “We are confident the attorney general will make the right decision,” he said. “He has to consider the legal matters and rules. I’m confident he’ll make the right call. He’s a very good lawyer — a fine lawyer. We’re very comfortable with any decision.”Mr. Giuliani said that he planned to remain in Washington over the weekend, in part because Mr. Barr said he may update Congress on Mr. Mueller’s findings soon.[Maggie Haberman, Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and more of our journalists explained what the submission of the full report means and what may come next.]VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesTrump’s lawyers offer a brief statement.Shortly after the report was delivered, Jay Sekulow and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, offered a brief statement:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations,” they said. “Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”The Mueller investigation was closed without Mr. Trump ever sitting for a formal interview. The president’s lawyers were fearful of what he might say under penalty of perjury, and did not want him to sit for one. They anticipated that Mr. Mueller would not engage in a protracted battle to try to subpoena the president, and Mr. Mueller never did. The investigators did receive written answers to questions.Among those traveling with Mr. Trump to Florida aboard Air Force One on Friday was the new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone. The counsel’s office anticipates reviewing the report for possible issues related to executive privilege.With the delivery of the report looming, in Florida, at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort, Mr. Trump and his top aides stuck to business as usual: meeting with five Caribbean leaders, placing a phone call to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and, of course, tweeting.But a sense of anxiety loomed, and Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts added to the confusion on a day in which everyone around Mr. Trump was bracing for the end of the Russia investigation and what it might mean for his presidency. A confusing tweet by Mr. Trump at 1:22 p.m. seemed to roll back sanctions on North Korea, undermining his Treasury secretary, although later in the day, officials tried to clarify that Mr. Trump was talking about sanctions that were under consideration but not yet announced.Aides were waiting to see what language Mr. Mueller’s team used in the report about the president’s actions before pushing ahead with a more vocal response.Bipartisan demands pour in to release the full report.Mr. Trump has said that the report should be made public. But lawmakers are not relying on him. In a joint statement, the two top Democrats in Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer said that “it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress. Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.”ImageSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesSenator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed that sentiment. “Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves,” Mr. Warner said. “The special counsel’s report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the attorney general should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice.”He pointedly added, “Any attempt by the Trump administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling for full disclosure.“I will work with Ranking Member Feinstein and our House Judiciary Committee colleagues to ensure as much transparency as possible, consistent with the law,” he said.Only a few Justice Department officials have seen the report.Only a handful of law enforcement officials have seen the report, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec.Justice Department officials notified the White House about 20 minutes before telling lawmakers, Ms. Kupec said. A security officer from the special counsel’s office delivered the report to the deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, on Friday afternoon, and it was handed off to Mr. Barr within minutes.After top officials looked through the report, Mr. Barr’s chief of staff, Brian Rabbitt, called Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer representing the president in the Russia investigation, just after 4:30 p.m. to let him know that the department had the report.While the White House was not given the report, Mr. Rabbitt gave Mr. Flood a readout of the letter that would be delivered to Congress. The letter included important details, including the fact that Mr. Barr’s summary of Mr. Mueller’s key findings be sent to legislators as early as Sunday evening. It also said that there were no instances when Mr. Rosenstein, the former acting attorney general, Matthew P. Whitaker, or Mr. Barr told Mr. Mueller that he could not pursue an investigative action.The Justice Department said that the investigation was complete and that any department lawyers who were working on Mr. Mueller’s team would return to their positions. A small number of special counsel staff will remain on, to assist in closing the operations of the special counsel’s office. And Mr. Mueller himself will remain the special counsel as loose ends are tied up.ImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, leaving his house on Friday morning in Virginia.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDemocratic 2020 candidates focus on transparency.Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding that the special counsel’s finding be made public immediately — and trying to build up their electronic lists of supporters by blasting out email about the report.With no detailed information available about the report, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Mr. Barr would release it.“Attorney General Barr — release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,” Senator Warren wrote on Twitter.“I am demanding the Mueller report be made immediately available for members of Congress and for the public. Anything short of full transparency will be detrimental to our country moving forward,” Senator Booker tweeted.“Special counsel Mueller’s report should be made public without any delay,” Senator Gillibrand said. She also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: “See you Sunday.” That’s when Ms. Gillibrand is planning to formally kick off her campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York.Senator Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released “immediately,” called on Attorney General Barr to “publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.” And Senators Harris and Warren emailed supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report’s immediate release.Five additional candidates — Senators Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders; former Representatives Beto O’Rourke and John Delaney; and Julián Castro — also called for the release of the full report.“As Donald Trump said, ‘Let it come out,’” Senator Sanders wrote on Twitter. “I call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller’s full report public as soon as possible. No one, including the president, is above the law.”Fired F.B.I. director urges public to look beyond politicsSince the investigation began, Americans have been guessing about what, if anything, Mr. Mueller would uncover. Mr. Trump has used an all-purpose shorthand to describe his view of the inquiry: “witch hunt.” James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump for his role in the investigation, in Op-Ed published Thursday in The New York Times, urged the country to look at the inquiry in a different way, beyond partisan politics.“I am rooting for a demonstration to the world — and maybe most of all to our president and his enablers — that the United States has a justice system that works because there are people who believe in it and rise above personal interest and tribalism,” he wrote.ImageA television reporter prepared to speak on air in front of the Justice Department.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesOn television, cue the speculationThroughout Friday, journalists waited anxiously for word of the delivery of the special counsel report to Mr. Barr. Cable news pundits and anchors filled airtime with speculations about whether the report would land on Friday and what it might say. Then, just after 5 p.m., news came that the report had been delivered — without any hint about what it actually said. A CBS anchor broke into postgame coverage of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament to inform viewers about the report’s arrival. On CNN, Wolf Blitzer read aloud from a printout of the letter that Mr. Barr had sent to members of Congress.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.Democrats have already started investigating the president.Many Democrats, notably Ms. Pelosi, have played down the prospect of bringing impeachment proceedings against the president. But several House committees have started investigations into the president’s possible connection to Russia, the role of several members of his family may have played, and a broad menu of other matters, including his personal finances.How we got here.The Mueller investigation has had many plotlines, crossing oceans and delivering indictments. It can be confusing to keep track of it all. Take a look at this story to help sort it out.Here is what we know so far.Trump undermined the report before it arrived.Mr. Trump has been trying to lay the predicate for undermining the report. On Wednesday he said of Mr. Mueller, “But it’s sort of interesting that a man, out of the blue, just writes a report.”Mr. Mueller did not randomly or arbitrarily decide to write a report. It is mandated by regulations on the appointment of a special counsel.ImagePresident Trump arrived Friday afternoon in West Palm Beach, Fla.CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times“At the conclusion of the special counsel’s work, he or she shall provide the attorney general with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel,” the regulations say.Then, in an interview aired on Fox on Friday, he went on to question the authority of the Justice Department to render a judgment on an elected official. “Well, it’s always interesting to me because a deputy that didn’t get any votes appoints a man that didn’t get any votes — he’s going to write a report on me,” Mr. Trump said. “Comey’s his best friend.”The special counsel role is not an elected office, but the same can be said of the attorney general, deputy attorney general, or hundreds of other top officials serving in the government. Special counsels appointments occur when a potential conflict of interest arises from the executive branch of government investigating itself. Mr. Mueller was appointed by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who was in turn nominated by Mr. Trump.James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has denied that he is “best friends” with Mr. Mueller, and Mr. Comey’s lawyer has said the two men are friendly colleagues, but “don’t really have a personal relationship.” (Mr. Barr, however, has said that he and Mr. Mueller are personal friends.)The beat goes on in the Southern District of New York.The senior prosecutor who led the case against Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, announced Friday that he would leave his job as deputy United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to making hush payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The case, which has the potential to threaten Mr. Trump’s presidency, is separate from the special counsel investigation and will continue.Maggie Astor, Katie Benner, David Enrich, Carl Hulse, Maggie Haberman, Linda Qiu, Michael S.

Mueller III, who submitted his report to the Justice Department on Friday, has already revealed a range of events related to Russian interference in the 2016 election and produced a series of high-profile indictments. Six people connected to President Trump have been charged by the special counsel with an array of crimes, including financial fraud and lying to Congress and investigators. Five have been convicted or pleaded guilty. Twenty-eight others, including 26 Russians, also face charges.Our videos tell you what you need to know about three of the most prominent Trump associates who have been charged or convicted as a result of the Mueller investigation.Paul ManafortVideoPresident Trump’s former campaign chairman has been sentenced to a total of 7½ years in prison for a variety of federal crimes.

The Manhattan district attorney has also filed more than a dozen state criminal charges, including mortgage fraud, against Mr. Manafort.

This is a special episode of “The Daily.” Today: The Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general. It’s Friday afternoon, March 22. So Mike, talk me through your day today.michael schmidtSo knowing it was going to be a big day, I turned on the recorder as soon as I left the house this morning and made my way into the office to hurry up and wait.[music]michael schmidtAll right. 10:05 a.m.michael schmidtI left my house at 10:00 a.m.michael schmidtWe expect the report to be finished today around noon.michael schmidtWalking down 17th Street, heading to the office.michael schmidtI got a call from the office from my editor wanting to know what I knew. Told her I knew nothing. Last thing an editor wants to hear — nothing new.michael schmidtNot a ton of people on the streets.speakerExcuse me.michael schmidtYes?speakerDo you know where the Jamaican Embassy is?michael schmidtI do not, I’m sorry. Do you know what the address is?michael schmidtWas stopped by a woman who couldn’t find the Jamaican embassy.michael schmidtO.K., so you’re going to want to go this way. Go to DuPont Circle, and make a right. Just keep on following that trail.speakerOh, O.K., so I’m going the wrong way.michael schmidtWell, we’re all going the wrong way.michael schmidtCome up to Massachusetts Avenue.michael schmidtCold March day. Fairly cold here in Washington. 45 degrees.michael schmidtJust had a normal sort of walk into the office.michael schmidt[HUMMING] Half a block away, coming up to 17th —michael barbaroIt doesn’t seem like you’re in a big hurry to get to the office.michael schmidtWell, all the work has been done. We know what’s coming.michael schmidtHow are you?speakerHey, Mike.michael schmidtWhat’s going on?michael schmidtSo come into the building.michael schmidtBig day? No? Not a big day? All right.michael schmidtGet on the elevator.elevator voice announcerFloor seven.michael schmidtWalk into the office. And everyone wants to know —speaker 1What do you got? What do you got?speaker 2Chasing the report.michael schmidtWhen’s it going to happen?speakerThis is the question I ask him every five —michael schmidtDays or —speakerDays or weeks.michael schmidtDays or weeks?michael schmidtThe whole apparatus of The New York Times is jacked up for this moment.michael schmidtWe got Nick here. We’re all ready.speakerGang’s all here.michael schmidtThere’s been a lot of time and planning that’s gone into this. There’s a lot of stories that have been written that are ready to go.speakerDoes that seem right?michael schmidtYep.speakerO.K.michael schmidtEveryone’s sitting around waiting, and they want answers.dean baquetSo what’s the latest?michael schmidtDean Baquet, our executive editor, calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller, our bureau chief, what do you know?elisabeth bumillerYou’re not so sure about it?michael schmidtI’m less sure about the timing, but —michael schmidtElizabeth calls me over to her desk, puts him on speakerphone. Mikey, what do you know?dean baquetDo you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get?michael schmidtMy guess is not a lot because I don’t know what there is to get a heads-up on.michael schmidtAnd I said, I don’t know.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] You tell them that you don’t know.michael schmidtWe don’t know!dean baquetO.K.elisabeth bumillerThat’s what we got.michael schmidtSo that’s all we got.elisabeth bumillerAnd we have stories ready. Once we get the word from Justice, we just push a button.michael schmidtAll the work is done.elisabeth bumillerWe’re just tourists hanging around.michael schmidtWe’re sort of lemmings at this point.michael schmidtSo it’s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts.michael barbaro[LAUGHS]michael schmidtAnd then it happens.archived recordingThe special counsel investigation is over. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.michael barbaroSo what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?michael schmidtOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.michael barbaroIs that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?michael schmidtWe just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.michael barbaroSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.michael schmidtCorrect. And it’s a very difficult process, because if there is criminality in regards to the president, it’s a very tricky issue to navigate. The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can’t be indicted. But if the president can’t be indicted, Congress should deal with that behavior. How do you give that information to Congress? It’s not a snap decision you can make — like, O.K., Mueller’s done, this is what he found. Let’s put this in another box and send it to Congress. It’s far trickier.michael barbaroSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report?michael schmidtBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.michael barbaroAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend, in your mind, Mike, on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends?michael schmidtYes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.michael barbaroAnd on the other hand, if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president, how does Barr have to proceed?michael schmidtWell, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.michael barbaroIs it safe to say though, Mike, that if criminality is found by Mueller, Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found?michael schmidtMaybe. Maybe. But look, this is a highly unusual situation. The person who runs the executive branch, the president, has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months. Very awkward situation.michael barbaroAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president.michael schmidtCorrect. Has the job because the president put him there. So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says, well, how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts?michael barbaroSo when will we know more? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front?michael schmidtOh, now you want to know more.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] Yes, please.michael schmidtThe greed of the news business.michael barbaroIf you’ll indulge us.michael schmidtWhen will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.michael barbaroSo now we wait again.michael schmidtHurry up and wait.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroIn a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress sent on Friday afternoon, Attorney General William Barr said he would brief them on the major conclusions of the special counsel’s report as soon as this weekend. On Friday evening, The Times reported that Mueller is not recommending any new charges against President Trump or anyone else around him. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Russia, Trump and Mueller: The Major Moments in the CaseAdvertisementSupported byRussia, Trump and Mueller: The Major Moments in the CaseImageCreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Michael S. Schmidt and Scott ShaneMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has delivered a report to Attorney General William P. Barr of findings from his investigation into Russia’s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. Unless you’re a counterintelligence analyst, you may have lost track of how we got to this point in the saga and why Mr. Mueller was investigating President Trump in the first place. Here is a guide to what has happened over the past three years (yes, it’s been that long) and what we learned. [What questions do you have about the Mueller report? We're answering them live. And here’s what’s next.]March 2016Russia attacks the American presidential campaign. Military intelligence officers in Moscow, working for the agency known as the G.R.U., used phishing emails and malware to hack into the Democratic National Committee and the Gmail account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager.Meanwhile, operatives at the Internet Research Agency, a private company in St. Petersburg with Kremlin ties, accelerated their influence campaign, posing as Americans on Facebook and Twitter to mock Mrs. Clinton, promote Mr. Trump and sow discord. Other operatives came to the United States to gather intelligence and coordinate with unwitting Trump campaign staff to organize rallies, according to an indictment.They were all aspects of a broader Russian operation that began in 2014, court papers show. American intelligence agencies would conclude that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the intervention. Though it began well before Mr. Trump announced his run, Mr. Putin, who had long despised Mrs. Clinton, was later drawn to Mr. Trump’s Russia-friendly stances. As Mr. Trump gained ground in the race, the Russian operatives adjusted their targets accordingly.Read More:The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.The Plot to Subvert an Election: Unraveling the Russia Story So FarJuly 2016The F.B.I. begins examining links between Trump’s campaign and Russia.Three days before the Democratic Party nominated Mrs. Clinton, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails the Russians had hacked from the D.N.C., embarrassing Democrats and alerting the C.I.A. and F.B.I. to the Russian interference.Days later, F.B.I. agents learned the details of an even more troubling fact: One of Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos, knew in advance about Russia’s plans. As links between the Trump campaign and Russia emerged, Mr. Trump’s repeated praise for Mr. Putin, and his disdain for NATO and traditional American allies — unusual stances for a Republican — added to suspicions about his relationship with Russia.In late July, the F.B.I. opened an investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, to examine the connections between Trump associates and Russia. The investigation initially focused on Mr. Papadopoulos and three others with significant Russian ties: Paul Manafort, Michael T. Flynn and Carter Page.Read More:Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic ConventionCode Name Crossfire Hurricane: The Secret Origins of the Trump InvestigationDecember 2016Before taking office, the Trump team explores how sanctions on Russia might be lifted.After Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, discussed with the Russian ambassador the sanctions that President Barack Obama had imposed on Russia over its election interference. But Mr. Flynn lied about the conversations, both to others in the White House and to federal investigators, leading to his dismissal and criminal charges. Separately, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, met with a Russian banker during the presidential transition, calling it a routine diplomatic meeting; Russian officials said they had discussed the Kushner family’s real estate business.Incoming Trump administration officials began to explore how sanctions on Russia might be lifted, possibly as a result of a “grand bargain” over its incursions into Ukraine. Some Obama administration holdovers feared an easing of sanctions might be payback for Russian help in the election.Read More:In Closed Hearing, a Clue About ‘the Heart’ of Mueller’s Russia InquiryProsecutors Examining Ukrainians Who Flocked to Trump InauguralInvestigation Turns to Kushner’s Motives in Meeting With a Putin AllyFlynn Is Said to Have Talked to Russians About Sanctions Before Trump Took OfficeJanuary 2017Trump expresses skepticism of law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from the start.Weeks before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, the heads of the American intelligence agencies briefed him at Trump Tower about how Russia worked during the campaign to help him defeat Mrs. Clinton. But the information left Mr. Trump unconvinced.After the briefing, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, pulled Mr. Trump aside to warn him that a dossier compiled by a bureau informant asserted that the Russians had compromising material on him, though Mr. Comey cautioned that the information had not been corroborated.Throughout the early months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, he grew increasingly agitated with Mr. Comey. The president complained about the bureau’s decision to move forward with the Russia investigation and Mr. Comey’s unwillingness to say publicly that he was not under investigation.Read More:In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty. Comey Demurred.The Trump Dossier: What We Know and Who Paid for ItFrom the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin InterferedOP-ED Contributor: I’m Proud We Published the Trump-Russia DossierImageJames. B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in June 2017, a month after he was fired.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesMay 2017The special counsel picks up the investigation. On May 9, 2017, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, setting off a chain of events that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller several days later. Among the issues Mr. Mueller was assigned to investigate: the dimensions of Russia’s interference in the election, including any possible involvement by Trump associates; whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey and asking him to end the Flynn investigation; and whether the president was a witting or unwitting agent of Russia.Read More:Robert Mueller, Former F.B.I. Director, Is Named Special Counsel for Russia InvestigationWhat Will Mueller Do? The Answer Might Lie in a By-the-Book PastF.B.I. Opened Inquiry Into Whether Trump Was Secretly Working on Behalf of RussiaTalk of the 25th Amendment Underscores a Volatile PresidencyJune 2017Angry about Mueller, Trump tries to oust him.Mr. Trump stewed about Mr. Mueller’s investigation, blaming Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from oversight of the inquiry on the counsel of ethics advisers. A month after Mr. Mueller’s appointment, a fed-up president told his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn, to fire Mr. Mueller, but Mr. McGahn refused.The episode was one of many actions and statements by the president, many of them in public, that seemed to be intended to disrupt or derail the Mueller investigation, which Mr. Trump routinely derided as a “witch hunt.” The pattern would feed into Mr. Mueller’s task of deciding whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice or tried to do so.Read More:Trump Asked Sessions to Retain Control of Russia Inquiry After His RecusalTrump’s Son Met With Russian Lawyer After Being Promised Damaging Information on ClintonTrump Ordered Mueller Fired, but Backed Off When White House Counsel Threatened to QuitOctober 2017Mueller’s investigation accelerates, snaring many in Trump’s campaign and inner circle.Mr. Manafort and another senior campaign official, Rick Gates, were indicted on charges of financial crimes related to their work as consultants for a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine. Court papers revealed that Mr. Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russian intermediaries during the campaign. A month and a half later, Mr. Flynn also pleaded guilty to lying about his own contacts with the Russians and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.The investigation, in other words, had already caught up Mr. Trump’s campaign manager and first national security adviser, among many others. Most of the charges involved lying to the F.B.I. or to Congress, and a pressing question for Mr. Mueller’s team was why so many of Mr. Trump’s associates felt compelled to conceal the truth.Read More:Former Trump Aides Charged as Prosecutors Reveal New Campaign Ties With RussiaHow the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political DirtMichael Flynn Pleads Guilty to Lying to the F.B.I. and Will Cooperate With Russia InquiryEmails Dispute White House Claims That Flynn Acted Independently on RussiaFebruary 2018Mueller uses two indictments to lay bare the Russian election attack.In detailed court papers that laid out a major aspect of the Kremlin’s interference scheme, Mr. Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies for mounting the fraudulent social media campaign. A second indictment would follow in July, naming the Russian military intelligence officers who had hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the campaign.The accused Russians were unlikely ever to be arrested or face trial. But the indictments, packed with remarkable detail, had a political impact: They undercut Mr. Trump’s repeated claims that no one really knew whether Russia was responsible for the election interference or that the Russian actions were a “hoax.”Read More:13 Russians Indicted as Mueller Reveals Effort to Aid Trump Campaign12 Russian Agents Indicted in Mueller Investigation12 Russians Charged: Major Highlights of the Indictment and Rod Rosenstein’s StatementVideoIn his cooperation with prosecutors, Michael D.

Mueller III.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesApril 2018Trump’s problems grow larger than just the Mueller investigation.Mr. Mueller’s investigators unearthed new leads about possible corruption relating to Mr. Trump beyond Russia. After a referral from Mr. Mueller, federal prosecutors in Manhattan began investigating potential violations of campaign finance laws, raiding the residences and office of Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. He pleaded guilty in August to illegally paying off two women during the 2016 campaign to silence them about sexual encounters they alleged with Mr. Trump, who has denied the affairs.In court, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange the payments, an assertion echoed by prosecutors months later, effectively tagging Mr. Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator in the crime.Also in August, a jury convicted Mr. Manafort on financial fraud counts, not tied to the Trump campaign but exposing him to a lengthy prison sentence. He would plead guilty in a separate case, agree to cooperate — but later be accused of continuing to lie as prosecutors questioned him under his plea agreement. Prosecutors would say he had given Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a longtime associate suspected of ties to Russian intelligence, detailed polling data from the presidential campaign.Read More:Michael Cohen Secretly Taped Trump Discussing Payment to Playboy ModelTools of Trump’s Fixer: Payouts, Intimidation and the TabloidsPaul Manafort, Trump’s Former Campaign Chairman, Guilty of 8 CountsVideoPresident Trump’s former campaign chairman has been sentenced to a total of 7½ years in prison for a variety of federal crimes.

His plea demonstrated that Mr. Trump had continued to negotiate over a proposed Trump Tower Moscow deep into the campaign — even as he publicly encouraged the Russians to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails and the Kremlin kept up its effort to help his campaign.As the investigations around Mr. Trump intensified at the end of the year, he tried a familiar tactic: He asked his acting attorney general to try to exert more control over the investigations related to Mr. Cohen.In January, Mr. Mueller continued his pursuit of those around Mr. Trump, indicting the president’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, on charges of lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign. The indictment contained a curious detail. It said that a senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to have Mr. Stone inquire from WikiLeaks about the future release of material damaging to Mrs. Clinton.Read More:Cohen Pleads Guilty and Details Trump’s Involvement in Moscow Tower ProjectProsecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters.

He said he had only “suspicions” of a Trump-Russia connection but laid out evidence of a range of possible crimes with no Russian connection.He displayed a check signed by the president, he said was to reimburse him for hush money payments, that could implicate Mr. Trump in a campaign finance violation. He described how Mr. Trump inflated and deflated the value of his assets to get loans or reduce taxes, actions that could amount to bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion. He said Mr. Trump had indicated, without directly instructing him, that he should lie to Congress. He described how Mr. Trump had used his charity to purchase a portrait of himself, in evident violation of state laws governing charitable foundations.Read More:Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and CriminalityTestimony From Cohen Could Compound Legal Issues for TrumpWith Sweeping Document Request, Democrats Launch Broad Trump Corruption InquiryWhat’s next?In less than two years, Mr. Mueller had charged 34 people with 199 counts — an impressive record by the standards of past investigations.

If Mueller’s findings compel legal action, the attorney general should reconsider the policy against indictment of a sitting president. By J.T. Smith IIMr. Smith served as executive assistant to Attorney General Elliot Richardson in 1973.March 7, 2019ImageAttorney General Elliot Richardson at a news conference in 1973.CreditCreditBettmann/Getty ImagesReports that Robert Mueller will soon issue the findings of his investigation have brought a new urgency to the question of whether, assuming sufficient evidence exists, a president can be indicted while in office.Most people take for granted that both Mr. Mueller and the new attorney general, William Barr, accept the current Justice Department legal position — reached in a 2000 opinion — that a sitting president cannot be indicted. In a June 2018 memo, Mr. Barr said that under “the Framers’ plan,” the “proper mechanism for policing the president’s” actions “is the political process — that is, the People, acting either directly, or through their elected representatives in Congress.”Yet since 1973, the Justice Department has revisited its position five times on the question of indicting a sitting president and reached different conclusions. In fact, as executive assistant to President Richard Nixon’s attorney general, Elliot Richardson, I can speak to the circumstances that delivered that first opinion: The principal purpose of the 1973 Watergate-era legal opinion — which concluded that a sitting president cannot be indicted — was to aid in removal from office of a criminally tainted vice president, who, the memo concluded, could be indicted. But it was not intended to set an ironclad precedent that would forever shape how a president might be treated. My experience makes me believe that Attorney General Barr should reconsider Justice Department policy. If the evidence gathered by the Mueller investigation on the actions of the president and his advisers indicates a crime, an indictment might be the proper course to hold the president accountable. Further, the indictment policy does not stand in isolation: It has repercussions for a Mueller report and access to it for Congress and the American public.The durability of the Office of Legal Counsel’s 1973 opinion is curious. It was prepared under extraordinarily stressful and unique circumstances — borne from the investigations that led to the resignations of Vice President Spiro Agnew that year and President Nixon in 1974.In 1973, Vice President Agnew faced a grand jury investigation, mostly stemming from his tenure as governor of Maryland, into alleged bribery, extortion and tax evasion. Mr. Agnew resisted pressure to resign. Attorney General Richardson sought guidance on the indictment question in an effort to bring pressure on the vice president.When the legal opinion was written, it was a very close question and was ultimately shaped by Mr. Richardson’s goal to remove the vice president from his office. The Office of Legal Counsel determined “there is no express provision in the Constitution which confers such immunity upon the President,” even though Article I, Section 6 provides for limited immunity for members of the legislature. (It also said, in reaching its conclusion, that there were “a number of policy factors that weigh heavily against” indicting a sitting president.)Following the determination on vice presidents, Mr. Richardson obtained the indictment of Mr. Agnew, and rather than face a prolonged legal battle, the vice president pleaded no contest and resigned in 1973.An often-overlooked facet of the Agnew case — but highly relevant to our circumstances today — was Mr. Richardson’s insistence that the vice president’s resignation and plea on a single count be accompanied by an extraordinary, publicly available 40-page summary of the criminal behavior involving Mr. Agnew that the Justice Department was prepared to prove at trial. Mr. Richardson believed, correctly, that a full recounting of Mr. Agnew’s shameful behavior would put to rest any contention by his supporters that he had been made a political victim.Ten days after Mr. Agnew’s resignation, though, Mr. Richardson himself resigned, as part of the events leading up to the Saturday Night Massacre. In an effort to end the Watergate investigation, Mr. Nixon called for the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Mr. Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus both resigned rather than carry out that order.Mr. Richardson, Mr. Cox and their successors also insisted upon access to White House evidence. They deeply appreciated the right and responsibility of Congress to exercise reasonable stewardship regarding the behavior of leadership of the executive branch.Mr. Mueller’s investigation has brought us to face similar questions of institutional integrity and transparency for the American public. If Mr. Barr determines that Mr. Mueller’s findings compel legal action, he should reconsider the policy against indictment of a sitting president.But if Mr. Barr holds to the view that a president’s actions should be policed by the political and not criminal process, it will be imperative that he share a Mueller report with Congress and, to the extent practicable, with the public, redacting only information that is classified or otherwise prohibited by statute.In light of the gravity of our circumstances, it would be timely and appropriate for the Justice Department to reconsider the shaky policy regarding indictability of a sitting president and provide Congress and the public with the Mr. Mueller’s full findings and conclusions. Only through sunlight and transparency can we preserve confidence in our national institutions and leadership.views on indicting a presidentOpinion | Marty Lederman: Would Indicting Trump Be Constitutional?Dec. 12, 2018Opinion | Douglas W.

Law in the past and we have been talking with him about returning to the law school following his current commitments,” Michael Orey, the public affairs director at the law school, said in a statement.The F.B.I. said David W. Archey, the lead F.B.I. agent in the special counsel’s office, left the special counsel’s team this month, a signal that the office’s investigative work has come to a close.Mr. Archey moved to the F.B.I.’s Richmond, Va., field office on March 4 to become the special agent in charge, the bureau said in a news release.The departures, which NPR first reported, have been closely scrutinized for clues about what they say about the apparent conclusion of the special counsel’s work. The inquiry’s findings seem sure to send shock waves through Washington, whether or not prosecutors found that President Trump or any member of his inner circle worked with Russia to interfere in the election or obstruct the investigation.Already the investigation — and speculation about when it will end and what its findings will reveal — has consumed the city, and is the focus of cable news reports, book deals and conversations at bars, restaurants and parties.Mr. Weissmann’s departure also comes as his cases against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates are drawing to a close. Mr. Manafort was sentenced on Wednesday in the second of two cases brought against him, and faces a total of up to seven and a half years in prison. (More charges against Mr. Manafort were filed Thursday by the Manhattan district attorney; Mr. Weissmann is not involved in that case.)Officials inside the Justice Department are preparing for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to deliver his confidential report on the investigation’s findings to William P. Barr, the attorney general, according to multiple people inside the department who have been briefed on the planning. Mr. Barr will then summarize those findings and present them to Congress.But the White House legal team and others have incorrectly predicted an imminent end to the investigation for more than a year. And Democratic lawmakers have vowed to obtain Mr. Mueller’s full report, no matter what Mr. Barr presents to them, guaranteeing that the submission of the report will not end debate over the Mueller inquiry and its findings. The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to pass a bipartisan resolution calling on Mr. Barr to release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation to the public.Mr. Weissmann, 60, has been considered a key player on Mr. Mueller’s team and one of its most aggressive prosecutors.A graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Mr. Weissman previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I. while Mr. Mueller was the director.He gained a reputation as one of the most relentless prosecutors in the case against Enron, the energy company implicated in a widespread accounting fraud. Not only did he secure indictments of the company’s top officers, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, he also charged the wife of the company’s chief financial officer with tax fraud and won a case against Enron’s accounting firm, Arthur Anderson, which helped lead to the firm’s demise. The Supreme Court eventually overturned the decision in the Arthur Andersen case.Within Mr. Mueller’s team, Mr. Weissmann maintained his own office, a sign of his seniority.He helped construct the cases against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, and Mr. Gates, who was Mr. Manafort’s business partner and later deputy on the Trump campaign.Mr. Manafort was convicted on financial fraud charges stemming from his political consulting work in Ukraine and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice in two separate court cases.This Friday there will be a status hearing for Mr. Gates, whose sentencing has been delayed four times. He pleaded guilty to charges of financial fraud and lying to investigators and has been cooperating with the special counsel.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.

Mueller III, the special counsel, on Capitol Hill in 2017. The House resolution could pressure William P. Barr, the attorney general, to publicly release Mr. Mueller’s report.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New YorkBy Nicholas FandosMarch 14, 2019WASHINGTON — House Republicans joined Democrats on Thursday to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the possible involvement of President Trump’s campaign.Though the resolution is nonbinding, Democrats who put it on the House floor are trying to build public pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr before the investigation’s anticipated conclusion.Far from standing in the way, Republicans joined Democrats en masse. On the 420-to-0 vote, four Republicans voted present.“This report must see the light of day, must be available to the American public for a catharsis that will allow us to start with the facts, understand what happened and begin to rebuild the faith of the American people,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, which has undertaken its own Russia investigation.[Update: Mueller delivers report on Russia investigation to attorney general.] Republicans debating it on the House floor called the resolution a waste of time and said they trusted Mr. Barr. But they were unwilling to stand in its way.“I am especially concerned about what would happen if the report was not made available to Congress,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican, said in a statement. “Since the investigation began, Democrats have used it as an excuse to fund-raise, fear-monger and peddle conspiracy theories about collusion with the Russian government. Let’s bring this chapter to a close.”The four “present” votes came from two libertarians who routinely oppose such resolutions, Representatives Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and two ardent Trump loyalists, Representatives Matt Gaetz of Florida and Paul Gosar of Arizona.Mr. Gaetz said afterward that while he supported making the report public, he objected to other language in the resolution praising the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose team he has repeatedly attacked as partisan.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, tried to move the resolution through the Senate later on Thursday by unanimous consent, but he was blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.Though Mr. Graham, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he supported transparency, he asked to amend the resolution to include the appointment of a new special counsel to investigate the F.B.I.’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case and its surveillance of a former Trump adviser. Mr. Schumer rejected the request as political and beside the point, and the resolution failed.The Justice Department has given signals in recent weeks that after 22 months, Mr. Mueller is nearing completion of his work. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller, offered what many viewed as fresh evidence of an imminent conclusion on Thursday when he confirmed that one of the special counsel’s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, will be departing the special counsel’s office “in the near future.”The resolution — sponsored by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, and a handful of other Democratic committee leaders — “calls for the public release of any report Special Counsel Mueller provides to the attorney general, except to the extent the public disclosure of any portion thereof is expressly prohibited by law.”Under the regulation that governs special counsels, Mr. Mueller is expected to produce a confidential report on his prosecution decisions to Mr. Barr, who will then review it and produce his own report to Congress. Thus far, Mr. Barr has demurred on just what he will release to Congress and the public, reserving the right to keep some matters secret.Democrats seized on Mr. Barr’s resistance to making specific promises about the Mueller findings during his confirmation process in the Senate. They have not let the point rest in the weeks since, with prominent Democratic chairmen and other leaders laying out their case for why all of the special counsel’s findings — including underlying evidence — ought to be shared with Congress for review.House Democrats are prepared to use subpoena power and other tools at their disposal to force the Justice Department to turn over anything Mr. Barr chooses to withhold.They argue that the Justice Department set a new precedent in the last two years when it granted Republicans, who then controlled the House, extraordinary access to hundreds of thousands of pages of sensitive investigative material related to the F.B.I.’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server and the Russia investigation itself.“Last year, I directly warned department leadership that in providing these materials to Congress, they were establishing a precedent, and one they would have to live with in the future,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.Democrats also fear that the Justice Department could combine its policies against indicting a sitting president and against disclosing negative information on an investigative target who was not indicted to justify keeping secret all the information collected about Mr. Trump.“To maintain that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the president cannot be charged, is to convert D.O.J. policy into the means for a cover-up,” Mr. Nadler said during debate over the resolution on Thursday.Though they voted for the resolution, many Republicans expressed skepticism about the wisdom and likely success of Democrats’ quest. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters last week that he anticipated hurdles to public disclosure in the form of classified information, information obtained through a secret grand jury process and the need to insulate continuing prosecutions stemming from the investigation.“Those are also going to be things that we are going to have to litigate,” Mr. Collins said.

Barr should “let it come out.”Mr. Trump, who declined last month to commit to making the results of the investigation public, said “tens of millions” of Americans would want to read the report prepared by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“Let people see it. That’s up to the attorney general,” Mr. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. He later added: “There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing.”[Update: Mueller delivers report on Russia investigation to attorney general.]The law does not require the Justice Department to publicly release a report on the special counsel investigation, and in the past the president has said he would not interfere in the department’s decision about whether to do so.But the question of whether and how the report might be released has been a persistent one since Matthew G. Whitaker, then the acting attorney general, told reporters in January that the investigation was nearly completed. Mr. Whitaker said he hoped Mr. Mueller would submit a report on his findings “as soon as possible.”Mr. Barr declined to guarantee the public release of the report during his Senate confirmation hearings last month. Mr. Mueller has not publicly commented on the matter.But last week, Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives demanded, in a nonbinding vote of 420 to 0, that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation.Justice Department rules require Mr. Mueller to explain his prosecutorial decisions at the end of the investigation in a confidential report to the attorney general, who must then send a report to Congress indicating why the work has been completed.But the attorney general’s report to Congress is not required to be exhaustive and may be only a summary of the special counsel’s findings.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was looking forward to reading the report. But he told reporters he thought he should not have to bother with the special counsel investigation by dint of his “tremendous” Electoral College victory in 2016.“It’s sort of interesting that a man, out of the blue, just writes a report,” he said. “I think it’s ridiculous.”Related CoverageHouse Votes, 420-to-0, to Demand Public Release of Mueller ReportMarch 14, 2019ImageTrump Won’t Commit to Making Mueller Report PublicFeb. 3, 2019ImageAfter Devin Nunes Sues @DevinCow, the Twitter Parody Gains a Half-Million FollowersMarch 20, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWhat to Read While You’re (Still) Waiting to Read the Mueller Report - The New York Times

Mueller III, the special counsel, delivered his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election — and whether Donald Trump and his associates conspired with Russia or obstructed justice — to Attorney General William P. Barr, members of Congress, and the public, are still waiting to read the report’s contents.This week, Barr told Congress that he plans to make a redacted version of the Mueller report public, possibly by next week.While we wait to read the report — here are some books to occupy you the meantime.If you want to read about Robert Mueller and the inner workings of the Department of JusticeImage“The Threat Matrix: Inside Robert Mueller’s FBI and the War on Global Terror,” by Garrett M. GraffBased on rare interviews with Mueller, as well as with more than 150 former government and city officials, this book covers the former FBI director’s tenure and legacy, as well as the evolution of the Bureau. Graff explains that while FBI agents were once focused on solving crimes, post 9/11 they have also been tasked with preventing them, especially potential terrorist threats. The job has become more complex, in other words, and Graff argues that as the person who led the institution through this transition, Mueller is the most influential leader of the FBI since J. Edgar Hoover. Image“A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” by James ComeyWhen Trump fired F.B.I. director James Comey in May 2017, it triggered a rapid cascade of events within the Department of Justice that ultimately led to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. In this mega-best seller, Comey describes his role in the high-stakes investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Writing in the Times, Michiko Kakutani praised Comey’s eye for detail, referring to him as “what Saul Bellow called a “first-class noticer.”“Comey’s book fleshes out the testimony he gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017 with considerable emotional detail, and it showcases its author’s gift for narrative — a skill he clearly honed during his days as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York,” she wrote.Image"The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,” by Andrew G. McCabeThis scathing indictment (no, not in the technical sense) of the Trump administration is from the former deputy director of the F.B.I., who was fired last year right before his planned retirement. McCabe is unsparing in the book: “The work of the F.B.I. is being undermined by the current president.”Our critic Dwight Garner took appreciative note of McCabe’s “lean” prose: “The first sentence demands to be read in the voice of Jack Webb from “Dragnet”: “Between the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law.”Image“Doing Justice: A Prosecutor’s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law,” by Preet BhararaBharara, the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was also fired by Trump in 2017, which seems to be a great way to get a book deal.Bharara oversaw a significant investigation into insider trading by Wall Street executives, and also investigated Russian money laundering. Lately, he has become an omnipresent commentator on the myriad investigations into Trump (in addition to his new book and regular TV appearances, he has a popular podcast, “Stay Tuned With Preet”).But when it comes to the timing and content of the Mueller report, he’s as much in the dark as the rest of us, apparently.If you want to readabout Russia, Trump and Trump/RussiaImage"Collusion: How Russia Helped Trump Win the White House,” by Luke HardingHarding, a correspondent for The Guardian, explores Trump’s decades-long entanglements with Russia in what his publisher describes as a conspiracy “so huge it involves international espionage, offshore banks, sketchy real estate deals, the Miss Universe pageant, mobsters, money laundering, poisoned dissidents, computer hacking, and the most shocking election in American history.” Harding delves into Trump’s deals with Deutsche Bank and examines Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort’s extensive ties to Russian and Ukranian oligarchs.(It’s an exhaustive account, but by now, it’s a bit out of date: The book came out in 2017, many indictments and plea deals ago.)Image“Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump,” by Michael Isikoff and David Corn Isikoff and Corn, two veteran journalists in Washington, lay out how Russia unleashed hackers and internet trolls to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. They also explore the puzzling ties between Trump and his associates and Russian officials. In a review for The Times, the Times journalist Steven Lee Myers, the author of “The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin,” wrote: “For anyone who believes in the better angels of American politics, ‘Russian Roulette’ is a depressing book. The Russian hacking, it is now clear, simply exploited the vulgarity already plaguing American political campaigns, which churn on spin and strategy (and money) far more than vision or values.”Image“The Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy,” by Greg Miller In “The Apprentice,” Miller, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has covered national security for The Washington Post, details how Russia exploited American technology platforms to spread misinformation, damaging Hillary Clinton and boosting Trump, while at the same time hacking and releasing Democratic emails, further inflaming partisan divisions in an already nasty campaign. He also explores links between Trump and his associates and Russia, but steers clear of speculation about what the ultimate revelations regarding Trump’s possible complicity might be.“Miller makes no pretense about knowing the end of the story and acknowledges that at this point he does not know whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, will accuse the president of any crimes,” a critic wrote in The Washington Post.Image“From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin’s Russia,” by Michael McFaulMcFaul, a former ambassador to Russia, was responsible for what became known as the “Reset,” a political plan put in place during the Obama administration to reboot relations with the country. McFaul argues that he and Barack Obama were able to drive forward a range of policies, but that the election of Vladimir Putin halted their plans. McFaul became persona non grata in Russia. He and his family were closely surveilled, and McFaul was subjected to cyber attacks meant to discredit him, such as YouTube videos suggesting he was a pedophile or a fake Twitter account that posted criticisms of the Russian elections under his name. “McFaul combines both analytical and personal perspectives to offer a fascinating and timely account of the current crisis in the relationship between Russia and the United States,” our reviewer wrote. If you want to read about historical precedentsImage“All the President’s Men,” by Carl Bernstein and Bob WoodwardThis is the definitive account of the explosive investigation that brought down President Richard Nixon, by two now-famous reporters from The Washington Post. More recently, with his latest best-seller, “Fear,” Woodward has unleashed his investigative skills on the Trump administration.Image“The Starr Report: The Findings of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair,” by The Washington Post and Kenneth W. StarrIt took Kenneth Starr, a former special counsel, around four years and $40 million to complete his investigation into President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, and whether Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in an effort to cover up the scandal. The salacious account is a door-stopper, almost 500 pages long.If you only want the real thingSeveral publishers, including Skyhorse, Scribner and Melville House, as well as the audiobook publisher Audible, have already announced their plans to publish the Mueller report and have made the books available on Amazon for pre-order. (Presumably the pages are still blank.)Or, if you can’t wait, you can always reread some of Mueller’s vividly detailed indictments. Those documents lay out contours of the investigation so far, which has led to 199 charges against 34 people and three companies.ImageImageAlexandra Alter writes about publishing and the literary world.

He also explores links between Trump and his associates and Russia, but steers clear of speculation about what the ultimate revelations regarding Trump’s possible complicity might be.“Miller makes no pretense about knowing the end of the story and acknowledges that at this point he does not know whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, will accuse the president of any crimes,” a critic wrote in The Washington Post.Image“From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin’s Russia,” by Michael McFaulMcFaul, a former ambassador to Russia, was responsible for what became known as the “Reset,” a political plan put in place during the Obama administration to reboot relations with the country. McFaul argues that he and Barack Obama were able to drive forward a range of policies, but that the election of Vladimir Putin halted their plans. McFaul became persona non grata in Russia. He and his family were closely surveilled, and McFaul was subjected to cyber attacks meant to discredit him, such as YouTube videos suggesting he was a pedophile or a fake Twitter account that posted criticisms of the Russian elections under his name. “McFaul combines both analytical and personal perspectives to offer a fascinating and timely account of the current crisis in the relationship between Russia and the United States,” our reviewer wrote.

More recently, with his latest best-seller, “Fear,” Woodward has unleashed his investigative skills on the Trump administration.Image“The Starr Report: The Findings of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair,” by The Washington Post and Kenneth W. StarrIt took Kenneth Starr, a former special counsel, around four years and $40 million to complete his investigation into President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, and whether Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in an effort to cover up the scandal. The salacious account is a door-stopper, almost 500 pages long.If you only want the real thingSeveral publishers, including Skyhorse, Scribner and Melville House, as well as the audiobook publisher Audible, have already announced their plans to publish the Mueller report and have made the books available on Amazon for pre-order. (Presumably the pages are still blank.)Or, if you can’t wait, you can always reread some of Mueller’s vividly detailed indictments. Those documents lay out contours of the investigation so far, which has led to 199 charges against 34 people and three companies.ImageImageAlexandra Alter writes about publishing and the literary world.

What happens next?Monday, March 4th, 2019michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today — [MUSIC]archived recordingThe Democratic National Committee is trying to solve a spy mystery. It began before dawn Saturday when five intruders were captured by police inside the offices of the committee in Washington.michael barbaroThroughout U.S. history —archived recordingThe tangled relationship between an Arkansas land deal, a savings and loan and Hillary Rodham Clinton’s former law firm is again under scrutiny today.michael barbaroThere have only been a handful of investigations into possible criminal conduct by a sitting president.archived recording (bill clinton)I did not have sexual relations with that woman.archived recordingMr. Nixon says emphatically that the White House is in no way involved in the burglary and bugging of the Democratic headquarters, and he’ll have no further comment on that matter.michael barbaroAnd each time —archived recordingAttorney General Kleindienst pledged a comprehensive unbiased investigation of the break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters on June —michael barbaroAn outside investigator has been appointed.archived recordingWhitewater counsel Kenneth Starr has been granted permission to expand his investigation.michael barbaroAnd that investigator has to follow a set of guidelines, a set of rules to ensure they are both independent and accountable.archived recordingThis is a sacred process. This is not a witch hunt.michael barbaroAnd then, after each of these investigations, those guidelines have changed in response to the perceived flaws or excesses of the most recent investigation, in an attempt to improve them.archived recordingDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is announcing the appointment of a special counsel.michael barbaroNow, the latest set of rules —archived recordingFormer F.B.I. director Robert Mueller will now lead the investigation.michael barbaroAre being really tested for the first time, as special counsel Robert Mueller prepares to release his report later this month.neal katyalJust got on.michael barbaroThank you. Hey, I’m Michael Barbaro. It’s really great to meet you.neal katyalHey, Michael, ditto.michael barbaroSo we wanted to sit down with Neal Katyal, because he’s the person who wrote those rules. It’s Monday, March 4. Shall we start?neal katyalAbsolutely.michael barbaroNeal, from your very informed point of view, what do you expect this report to actually look like?neal katyalSo the first report that Mueller will send to the attorney general is supposed to be a summary of the investigation. And it’s supposed to detail the roads taken, the roads not taken, reasons why.michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalAnd then there’s a second report, and that is the report that the attorney general, William Barr, is going to give to the Congress. I don’t think that the special counsel regulations envision the two reports to look the same.michael barbaroAnd why do you say “think“? Having written these rules, don’t you know exactly what they envision?neal katyalI think the best way of thinking about the special counsel regulations is to think about it a little bit, and not to sound grandiose, but like a constitution. You can’t anticipate all of the crises that are going to happen in the years to come in a dynamic republic. And so you don’t have hard and fast rules. You have some rules, and then you have the spirit and the animating principles behind them.michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalThe animating focus of the special counsel regulations is to restore what it calls public confidence in the integrity of the process. And then reasoning backward from that, what’s the best thing I could do as attorney general, when I’m writing this report, to help facilitate that public confidence in the administration of justice? If the crime is something very serious, of national security concern, like potential collusion with Russia, more is going to be important. If the crime is something that’s much more minor, less information is required. And to me, that means that more information is required rather than less when you’re dealing with the highest level of our government, the president of the United States, and potential wrongdoing.michael barbaroSo you’re saying the guidelines will encourage the attorney general to give something quite comprehensive to Congress.neal katyalI don’t want to say it’s quite comprehensive. The regulations say that the attorney general is supposed to tell Congress the fact that the investigation’s concluded, some reasons why, and to detail any instances in which the attorney general or the attorney general’s predecessors, like Whitaker or Rod Rosenstein, who’s the acting attorney general, any instances in which they said no to Mueller. Now Barr can certainly go further and provide a lot of detail.michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalI think if Mueller decides not to prosecute X, despite there being some evidence, or to prosecute Y, I think those are the types of things that have to be explained in this report from Barr to Congress. But are we going to get something like the Starr Report or the 9/11 Report that’s going to be a big coffee table document? I don’t think we’ll see that.michael barbaroAnd why is that? Why aren’t we going to get a coffee table-sized version of this? I think it’s what many of us have been expecting. Why isn’t a full report from Mueller what goes to Congress rather than the A.G.‘s report on the report?neal katyalWhen we wrote the special counsel regulations, we weren’t writing them in a vacuum. We were writing them after many, many pages dumped on Congress in the Ken Starr report about Monica Lewinsky and Whitewater. And that, I think, should concern all Americans, that you have a prosecutor really, I think, impinging on some of the most sensitive privacy concerns that human beings have. And so the requirements in the special counsel regulations are not written the way they were in the Independent Counsel Act, to provide every piece of information that was a concern. On the other side was also the need for public confidence. And so it’s going to depend on the case. In a case in which you’re dealing with private consenting activity among adults, you’re not going to really want to have the same level of detail as when you’re talking about, say, collusion with Russia.michael barbaroGot it.neal katyalAnd I think maybe to just take a step back and understand what’s going on, why is all this written this way, it’s written this way because of the kind of oldest fear that democracies have, which is who’s going to guard the guardians? Or if you are a Dr. Seuss fan, who’s going to be the bee-watcher to the bee watcher-watcher, and so on?michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalAnd here, the idea is that the attorney general is supervising this investigation into the president, which is remarkable, because who appoints the attorney general? The president.michael barbaroRight.neal katyalAnd the way to try and deal with that hornet’s nest is to say, look, we can’t take the attorney general out of the prosecutorial system. That’s what our constitution requires. But we can make sure that sunlight is shed upon the attorney general’s actions when supervising that special counsel. And so that’s why the reporting requirement exists. And that’s why it can’t be that it simply be a one-line, like, we’re closing the investigation, and nothing else. There’s really got to be an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.michael barbaroSo given that the attorney general is a presidential nominee, works for the man who is under investigation, why should we trust that this person will follow the sort of broad outlines that you’re describing rather than firm rules that explicitly say what must happen?neal katyalIn our constitutional system, there really is no way to force an attorney general to do something that he doesn’t want to do when it comes to a special counsel. Because after all, the special counsel regulations are themselves just the creation of the attorney general. They can be repealed by an attorney general at any time.michael barbaroFascinating.neal katyalAnd so the idea behind these special counsel regulations is to just make it really difficult for an attorney general, a willful one, to interfere with an investigation. And so you outline the kind of concerns that an attorney general has to consider, like public confidence in the administration of justice. And then you hope for an attorney general and a confirmation process that ensures an attorney general whose character is such that the right thing will be done. We certainly anticipated that there’d be attorneys general who would act and be appointed in a political process. After all, we were all very well aware that, you know, Bobby Kennedy was John F. Kennedy’s attorney general.michael barbaroRight.neal katyalSo it’s not as if we were unaware of the possibility of political attorneys general or ones who had family relationships and the like. But at the same time, in our constitutional system, there’s no way to remove the attorney general from the process. And so all we could do was try and shed sunlight into the decisions made by the attorney general.michael barbaroSo let’s talk about how the sunlight process works. Once the A.G. report goes to Congress, what is in place to be sure that there is sunlight?neal katyalThe special counsel regulations actually require the attorney general report to go not just to the majority in Congress, but also to the minority party. Here it doesn’t matter, because there is now a Democratic or cross-party House of Representatives. But had this happened a year ago or six months ago, we wouldn’t have been able to say that. So that’s step one. Step two is — in the special counsel regulations is a provision for public disclosure of the report not just to Congress, but to the American people. So in part nine of the regulations, it says the attorney general is to make a determination that the public interest would be served by public release of the documents. Now it’s clear to say there are applicable legal restrictions. So grand jury information can’t ordinarily be released to the public. But that’s the way it would work, is the attorney general would review the report that he’s written and say, yeah, I think this should be made public, or maybe there’ll be some redactions and then be made public.michael barbaroAnd what do you expect Congress to do with this report? And is that part of what you envisioned in your guidelines?neal katyalAbsolutely. I think the answer to that really does turn on how much information is given to Congress, and does it look like a cover-up? If it does, if there’s stuff that Barr is not providing that looks really suspicious, then I expect Congress to start subpoenaing Mueller, Mueller’s team, the documents they’ve uncovered and who knows what else to try and get at what actually happened and find the truth out.michael barbaroCan you give me an example of what that might look like? What Congress might see in the report that the attorney general sends that would cause lawmakers to say, wait a minute. Something’s amiss, what’s going on?neal katyalSure. So think about the firing of Jim Comey, the F.B.I. director. At first, the president’s statement was, I did it because Jim Comey was unfair to Hillary Clinton —michael barbaroRight.neal katyal— in criticizing her. When that story fell apart, the president ultimately admitted to Lester Holt, I did it because of Russia. And that’s what led to this whole obstruction of justice investigation. Can you fire the F.B.I. director because you’re upset that he’s investigating you? That’s something Mueller’s investigating. Suppose Barr writes a report to Congress that says, obstruction of justice, we decided not to indict the president, period. Doesn’t explain why.michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalThere would then be two possible big buckets of reasons why that decision could be made. One is the facts just weren’t there. Maybe they found that Trump didn’t have a corrupt intent. Maybe he wanted to do it for other reasons. Who knows? But the second bucket is what Bill Barr wrote in his 19-page memo to Trump when he was, some people say, campaigning for the job or whatever, which is to adopt a really pretty ridiculous legal theory, which was, the president can’t obstruct justice when he fires a cabinet official because, after all, presidents can fire cabinet officials for any reason. That’s generally right, but you can’t have a kind of corrupt motive. It’s just like, I have a laptop, and I can throw it into the river or set it on fire if I want, no problem. I have the right to do that. But if I know the F.B.I. is coming and looking for the laptop, and they have a warrant, I can’t go do those things. So same thing, the president can fire a cabinet-rank official generally, but he can’t do it in order to obstruct justice. And so if the Barr memo didn’t explain why to Congress he wasn’t pursuing a prosecution, then absolutely, that would be something in which it would raise every investigator’s hackles, and we’d have to get to the bottom of it. Let me give you another example. Suppose that Barr says, I’m not indicting the president for collusion with Russia. Doesn’t explain why. Again, there’s two possible reasons. One is, the facts aren’t there. The other is, under some of these old Justice Department opinions, a sitting president can’t be indicted. If Barr doesn’t tell us which, absolutely Congress and perhaps other investigators need to subpoena the documents to find out what actually happened here.michael barbaroRight. They should not just have to guess at the reasoning behind the attorney general’s decision.neal katyalCorrect. And we’ve all been focused so much on the Mueller report and the Barr report, and those are undoubtedly important. But I think one thing to think about is how the Mueller and Barr reports set up a springboard to further investigations. Now there are multiple investigators. There’s the Democratically controlled House of Representatives and multiple committees therein. There’s the Southern District of New York and the campaign finance investigation they’re undertaking, as well as the investigation into the Trump Organization. And there are state attorneys general. So when Barr and Mueller write their reports, their audience is not simply Congress. And it’s not perhaps even just the American people. It’s also these other investigators.michael barbaroHmm.neal katyalIf they don’t do a good-enough job at explaining what they’ve done, and it looks like a cover-up, that’s going to fuel the fire of these other investigations. Then you’re going to have a kind of hydra of investigations with multiple different nodes.michael barbaroHmm.neal katyalAnd that’s going to, I think, actually become even more worrisome for Trump than the current kind of single focus that we’ve had for many of the last months.michael barbaroSo the less information that’s in it, the more likely these other investigations just multiply and intensify.neal katyalRight. Donald Trump has to be worried about winning the battle and losing the war — that is, getting a short report that maybe sides with him, and maybe sides with him in a brief way.michael barbaroHmm.neal katyalBecause that, more than anything, is going to raise the suspicions of Congress, of federal prosecutors in other offices and state attorneys general, and, ultimately, the suspicions of the American public.michael barbaroSo counterintuitively, I mean very counterintuitively, the best thing for President Trump might be for Congress to receive not a short, nothing-much-there-to-report Mueller report, but a fairly comprehensive, somewhat damning, but not overwhelmingly so report.neal katyalThat’s a beautiful summary. And I know it sounds counterintuitive, but in some ways, when you have that kind of very serious watchdog, it keeps you on your toes to be absolutely honest, but also really reassures the American public that there isn’t some shenanigan going on. And so sometimes the best protection you can have is actually to have a vigorous investigator. Obviously, Donald Trump has been afraid of that from the start. And the lingering question I think all Americans have is why.michael barbaroAre you concerned at all that if and when this report moves into this kind of, as you called it, hydra, many-headed model, that it also inherently kind of inevitably becomes more partisan, and therefore, it’s more open to criticism, more open to division, and that we might be better served if it were all completed through the process of a special counsel?neal katyalI think when we wrote the special counsel regulations, we really hoped that the special counsel would be the primary driver of the investigation. Because that would be someone who was chosen for their unimpeachable integrity.michael barbaroMm-hmm.neal katyalYou’re absolutely right to say as the investigation morphs into a variety of different nodes, you can’t guarantee that same level of stature of independence, of nonpartisanship. And things do become more political. But at the end of the day, I do think our founders really had it right — that sometimes, when you have overlapping jurisdiction, federal and state, and overlapping branches of government between congressional investigations and executive branch investigations, you actually do get at the right answer in the end, for reasons that James Madison said in Federalist 51: that people aren’t angels. And so if you can create overlapping investigative checks and balances, that it’s going to be cumbersome, it’s going to be frustrating, it’s going to be slow. But it is the way that we get truth in our system.michael barbaroNeal, I think listeners might hear that and think, oh, great. This has been a long, exhausting process, waiting for Mueller to finish this report. And it sounds like you’re saying, actually, this could really just be the very beginning.neal katyalI know everyone in America wants a quick resolution to this. I’m tired, everyone’s tired. But these are really hard investigations. I mean, independent counsel investigations go on year after year under the old regime. I remember when I came in in 1998, we had an independent counsel from the Reagan administration that was still acting.michael barbaroHmm.neal katyalSo this investigation in particular, because it involves counterintelligence and sources and methods and involves Russian documents and all sorts of people, it’s amazing to think, actually, that in 19 months, there have been 37 indictments and 199 counts. So I know that time delays are frustrating for everyone, but viewed in context, this has been one of the fastest investigations, not one of the slowest. [MUSIC]michael barbaroSo Neal, having written the rules that will govern how this all plays out, in response to the last two big presidential investigations, do you suspect that when this is all over, we’re going to have to rewrite these rules yet again?neal katyalWe just don’t know yet, because we’re living in it right now. We don’t know how the regulations have fared or not. We’ll have to see.michael barbaroAnd then we’re going to have you on and we’re going to ask you that question again.neal katyalI look forward to it. Thank you so much.michael barbaroThanks, Neal.neal katyalO.K., bye-bye.michael barbaroOn Sunday, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, said he would undertake an investigation involving dozens of individuals and organizations connected to President Trump that could eventually lead to his impeachment.archived recording (george stephanopoulos)Do you think the president obstructed justice?archived recording (jerry nadler)Yes, I do. It’s very clear that the president obstructed justice. It’s very clear. 1,100 times he referred to the Mueller investigation as a witch hunt.

Mr. Trump has repeated the phrase “no collusion” 71 times on Twitter alone.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Peter BakerMarch 22, 2019After nearly three years of investigation, after hundreds of interviews and thousands upon thousands of pages of documents, after scores of indictments and court hearings and guilty pleas, after endless hours of cable-television and dinner-table speculation, the moment of reckoning has arrived.It will be a reckoning for President Trump, to be sure, but also for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for Congress, for Democrats, for Republicans, for the news media and, yes, for the system as a whole. The delivery of Mr. Mueller’s report to the Justice Department on Friday marked a turning point that will shape the remainder of Mr. Trump’s presidency and test the viability of American governance.Washington has been waiting for Mr. Mueller’s findings for so long and invested in them so much that it may be hard for what he has delivered to live up to the breathless anticipation. But once released, the Mueller report will transform the political landscape, fueling calls for the president’s impeachment or providing him fodder to claim vindication — or possibly, in this live-in-your-own-reality moment, both at the same time.Democrats on Friday played down the notion that the report would be the final word, fearing that anything less than a bombshell would undercut their own drive to investigate Mr. Trump not only on Russia’s election interference but on the myriad other subjects that have drawn their attention. Mr. Trump, for his part, had engaged in a particularly manic Twitter spree lately, assailing the “witch hunt” and the “hoax” and everyone he blames for them, like his fellow Republicans John McCain and Jeff Sessions, in what some had interpreted as a sign of his own anxiety before the special counsel’s verdict. But he was reported to appear relieved with early reports on Friday.The fact that Mr. Mueller issued no further indictments as he wrapped up on Friday and never charged any Americans alleging criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia emboldened the president’s Republican allies, who promptly interpreted the results as exonerating him without having seen the report itself.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.Yet whatever the final conclusions, the Mueller investigation has already cast a cloud over Mr. Trump and his presidency. The special counsel has demonstrated that Russia intervened in the 2016 election with the goal of helping Mr. Trump, that the Trump campaign welcomed Russians promising incriminating information on behalf of their government about Hillary Clinton and that his advisers knew about stolen Democratic emails in advance.The investigation has demonstrated as well that Mr. Trump was seeking to do business in Russia even as a presidential candidate longer than he had previously disclosed and that he surrounded himself with crooks and liars in the form of advisers who repeatedly dissembled to investigators. That includes his campaign chairman, who is going to prison for that and a variety of financial crimes.Whether any of that adds up to impeachable offenses remained an open question. Mr. Trump has repeated the phrase “no collusion” so often — 71 times on Twitter, according to the Trump Twitter Archive, and many more in speeches, interviews and other public statements — that he effectively set the bar so that anything short of a taped telephone conversation with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could be interpreted as vindication.[Read more: As Mueller report lands, prosecutorial focus moves to New York.] Moreover, the president and his allies have raised enough questions about the conduct of his investigators to convince many of his supporters that the real scandal is the “deep state” trying to thwart the will of the democratic system by dislodging him from office. The people pursuing him, Mr. Trump argues, are motivated by partisanship or personal bias.He has complained on Twitter about the “witch hunt” 183 times, according to the archive, and many more in other settings, including to reporters on Friday morning before leaving the White House for a long weekend in Florida. A poll by USA Today and Suffolk University found that 50 percent of Americans agreed that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry was a witch hunt and that Mr. Trump had been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics.And yet the swirl of scandal around Mr. Trump extends well beyond Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which was largely limited to issues related to Russia’s election interference and any efforts by the president or his aides to obstruct the investigation. Other federal, state and congressional investigations are looking into his various entities and allies, including his business, his inaugural organization and his foundation.ImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, will decide whether the Mueller report will be released, and if so, how much of it.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesFederal prosecutors in New York have already implicated the president in a scheme to violate campaign finance laws by arranging hush payments to keep two women from publicly discussing their claims to have had extramarital affairs with Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, affairs he has denied.Mr. Trump has also been accused of cheating on his taxes, violating the Constitution’s emoluments clause barring a president from taking money from foreign states, exaggerating his true wealth to obtain bank financing and other offenses. The sheer volume of allegations lodged against Mr. Trump and his circle defies historical parallel, possibly eclipsing, if they were all proved true, even Watergate, the nonpareil scandal of scandals.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]But none of the investigations has carried the authority or import of Mr. Mueller’s, in part because of his longstanding reputation in both parties as a straight shooter and in part because of the investigatory tools at his disposal. The assessment by Mr. Mueller, a lifelong Republican, decorated Vietnam War hero and former F.B.I. director under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, could go far, particularly with Republicans who may doubt other investigators.So at last some questions should be answered or at least addressed: Is there more to the story of Russia’s involvement in the election than is already publicly known? Did the Trump campaign cross lines that others have not before? Has the president used his power to improperly impede investigators? Or have Democrats assumed too much in their zeal to bring Mr. Trump down? Have journalists connected too many dots that do not really add up? Can there be conclusions that are widely accepted in such a polarized era?Some of the answers may start to become clear as soon as this weekend when Attorney General William P. Barr briefs congressional leaders on its principal conclusions. He will then have to decide whether to publicly release the report and, if so, how much.That will not be the end of the story, though, because Congress, at least the Democrat-controlled House, made clear on Friday that it will insist on seeing most everything. That could lead to a showdown between executive and legislative branches if Mr. Barr seeks to withhold parts of the report, one that potentially could be resolved by the third branch, the judiciary, in a constitutional showdown.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesNo report has been as anticipated in Washington since September 1998, when the independent counsel Ken Starr delivered to Congress the results of his investigation concluding that President Bill Clinton had committed impeachable offenses, with boxes of evidence transported to Capitol Hill in a pair of white vans trailed by news cameras as if they were O.J. Simpson’s Ford Bronco.Mr. Starr, in his case, was obligated by the law creating his office to report directly to Congress, which then voted on a bipartisan basis to release his report sight unseen, much to the chagrin of many lawmakers once they saw its explicit description of the sexual encounters between Mr. Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky that formed the basis for perjury and obstruction of justice charges.Mr. Mueller, by contrast, operated under a different legal basis, reporting to the attorney general. But the question of what constitutes “high crimes and misdemeanors,” as laid out in the Constitution for impeachment, remains exclusively the province of the House, now as then in the hands of the president’s political opposition.Taking a lesson in part from the Clinton impeachment effort, which demonstrated that impeachment succeeds in ending a presidency only if it is bipartisan, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she does not favor impeaching Mr. Trump because it would be divisive for the country, which she declared is “just not worth it.”In saying that any impeachment should be “so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” she was tacitly recognizing that while the Democratic House might vote for articles of impeachment, it would take at least 20 Republican senators to break with the president to muster the two-thirds vote required to remove him from office, which at the moment appears implausible.The real question, then, becomes whether Mr. Mueller has any evidence that is so damning, so definitive and so powerful that it changes that dynamic.

Mr. Trump has repeated the phrase “no collusion” 71 times on Twitter alone.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Peter BakerMarch 22, 2019After nearly three years of investigation, after hundreds of interviews and thousands upon thousands of pages of documents, after scores of indictments and court hearings and guilty pleas, after endless hours of cable-television and dinner-table speculation, the moment of reckoning has arrived.It will be a reckoning for President Trump, to be sure, but also for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for Congress, for Democrats, for Republicans, for the news media and, yes, for the system as a whole. The delivery of Mr. Mueller’s report to the Justice Department on Friday marked a turning point that will shape the remainder of Mr. Trump’s presidency and test the viability of American governance.Washington has been waiting for Mr. Mueller’s findings for so long and invested in them so much that it may be hard for what he has delivered to live up to the breathless anticipation. But once released, the Mueller report will transform the political landscape, fueling calls for the president’s impeachment or providing him fodder to claim vindication — or possibly, in this live-in-your-own-reality moment, both at the same time.Democrats on Friday played down the notion that the report would be the final word, fearing that anything less than a bombshell would undercut their own drive to investigate Mr. Trump not only on Russia’s election interference but on the myriad other subjects that have drawn their attention. Mr. Trump, for his part, had engaged in a particularly manic Twitter spree lately, assailing the “witch hunt” and the “hoax” and everyone he blames for them, like his fellow Republicans John McCain and Jeff Sessions, in what some had interpreted as a sign of his own anxiety before the special counsel’s verdict. But he was reported to appear relieved with early reports on Friday.The fact that Mr. Mueller issued no further indictments as he wrapped up on Friday and never charged any Americans alleging criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia emboldened the president’s Republican allies, who promptly interpreted the results as exonerating him without having seen the report itself.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.

Newsrooms around the world hope we actually get to see it. But no one is waiting more impatiently on that report than … Mom. She’s newly obsessed with politics the way everyone was newly obsessed with kale a few years ago. She gets on the phone to say “I just can’t watch the news anymore” and in the same breath recites all of last week’s “Meet the Press.” Her love of gossip, judgment and reading makes her the most eager audience for Mr. Mueller. But she’s not just sitting around playing Words With Friends and liking Facebook posts until that big (possible!) obstruction-of-justice bombshell drops. She’s waiting on a litany of other equally important reports.Report on whether you want her to throw away your fifth-grade science folder.Report on whether you watched this Michael Cohen testimony and whether you’re going to respond to her “Matthew Calamari lol” text.Report from the waiter on whether the chef uses any cumin in the sea bass.Report on whether Matt and Jess are still together, because she ran into Lindsay’s mom, Nancy, at Safeway, and Nancy seemed to think they had split up, but Facebook says they’re still married.Report on why that guy from that other movie she liked won an Oscar for that movie she didn’t like.Report on whether anyone else is on the line for this conference call. Hello?Report on whether you texted your cousin for her birthday yet.Report on whether you ever set up that JDate account she told you to make.Report on whether those Bed Bath & Beyond coupons actually never expire — because if it’s true, the whole store should be 20 percent cheaper all the time and the whole thing sounds like a scam.Report on whether you can pick her up a bottle of her Clinique moisturizer while you’re at Bloomingdale’s.2019 Consumer Reports rating for midsize sedans.Weather report for a city neither of you lives in but might be nice to visit someday.Report on whether you had time to read that email she sent you with that article about women in entertainment having a hard time starting a family.Alison Leiby is a writer and a comedian.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Newsrooms around the world hope we actually get to see it. But no one is waiting more impatiently on that report than … Mom. She’s newly obsessed with politics the way everyone was newly obsessed with kale a few years ago. She gets on the phone to say “I just can’t watch the news anymore” and in the same breath recites all of last week’s “Meet the Press.” Her love of gossip, judgment and reading makes her the most eager audience for Mr. Mueller. But she’s not just sitting around playing Words With Friends and liking Facebook posts until that big (possible!) obstruction-of-justice bombshell drops. She’s waiting on a litany of other equally important reports.Report on whether you want her to throw away your fifth-grade science folder.Report on whether you watched this Michael Cohen testimony and whether you’re going to respond to her “Matthew Calamari lol” text.Report from the waiter on whether the chef uses any cumin in the sea bass.Report on whether Matt and Jess are still together, because she ran into Lindsay’s mom, Nancy, at Safeway, and Nancy seemed to think they had split up, but Facebook says they’re still married.Report on why that guy from that other movie she liked won an Oscar for that movie she didn’t like.Report on whether anyone else is on the line for this conference call.

This is “The Daily.” Today: Once the special counsel’s report has been released, it’s up to Congress and its oversight committees to determine what happens next.

Testing, 3, 6, 9. Testing, 4, 8 12. We can do the 5s.speakerLet’s hear it! [PHONE RINGING]michael barbaroHello. Congressman?representative jerry nadlerHi.michael barbaroHi. How are you?representative jerry nadlerO.K. How are you?michael barbaroGood. Thank you again for making some time for us. We really appreciate it.representative jerry nadlerYou’re quite welcome.michael barbaroSo Congressman, over the last couple of weeks on “The Daily,” we’ve explained to listeners how the Mueller report will be released. It goes to the attorney general. The attorney general then releases a report on the report that goes to Congress. And we’ve explained that it will either say we have evidence the president committed a crime, or we don’t have that evidence. We wanted to talk to you about what happens when that report gets to you.representative jerry nadlerWe investigate further. The fact that he committed a crime is of great interest. It’s not necessarily a guarantee of impeachment. Those are two different tests, as you know. We have a responsibility well beyond the Mueller report. We have an obligation to do our own work. The Mueller report is only for what happened with respect to Russian interference in the election and with complicity by Americans in that interference and what crimes were committed and by whom. We have to be considerably broader. I mean, that’s part of our work, but our basic work is to provide for the rule of law, make sure that the rule of law is protected. That means that we have to look into obstruction of justice, into corruption, into abuses of power. And certainly what Mueller is looking into is part of that, but we have to be much broader.michael barbaroYou said that a Mueller report that says the president committed a crime is not necessarily grounds for impeachment. Can you help me understand what you mean by that? What’s a scenario in which the Mueller report says the president committed a crime but wouldn’t equal impeachment, necessarily, in your mind?representative jerry nadlerWell, you have to understand that not every crime is an impeachable offense, and an impeachable offense needn’t be a crime. There are two different tests. So for example, if the Mueller report were to show that the president committed perjury with respect to money laundering five years ago in some scheme in New York to cheat — I don’t know. That would not be impeachable, because impeachment is an abuse of presidential power for the purpose or with the effect of aggrandizing power to the executive, of damaging liberty or the structure and functioning of government, the separation of powers. That’s what’s impeachable. Also, corruptly obtaining an election would be impeachable. But crimes that don’t bear on that would not be impeachable. So I said 20 years ago that the president’s perjury about a private sexual affair was not impeachable. And if President Trump were to be shown to have perjured himself about some business deal, that would not be impeachable. But if he were shown to commit perjury or to do something else that affected the structure and functioning of government or democratic rights or the integrity of elections, that would be impeachable.michael barbaroSo what do you do if the Mueller report says that the president committed a crime like money laundering five years ago but did not commit what you see as an impeachable offense?representative jerry nadlerWell, if the president was shown to have committed a crime of money laundering five years ago, I would hope the New York — he should be prosecuted for that.michael barbaroIn New York, right?representative jerry nadlerYeah, in New York, by the federal Southern District of New York or by the New York authorities or both, period. That’s the criminal justice system. Now the Justice Department maintains, wrongly in my opinion, that a sitting president cannot be indicted while in office, so they will not indict a president for committing some crime. I think it’s the wrong policy. I think they should be able to indict a president while he’s in office, but that’s not the real function of what we’re doing in our committee. Our committee’s job is not a criminal justice job. That’s up to the Department of Justice. That’s up to the New York state authorities. Our job is to protect the structure of democratic government and the liberties of the people. If the president committed a crime that has nothing to do with this, well, he ought to be prosecuted, but that’s not our business. We’re not a law enforcement agency.michael barbaroO.K., well, let’s flip this around and say the Mueller report finds that the president committed a crime that is absolutely grounds for impeachment. What do you do then?representative jerry nadlerWell, we have to further investigate it. Let’s put it this way. We have to do all these investigations now that we’re starting to do focused on obstruction, corruption, abuse of the power structure, et cetera. If we find that the president is guilty of that, then we have to decide what we can do about it. Impeachment is one option. But impeachment is the decision to be made further down the road, and it’s a very high bar. But it certainly would be on the table if we were to find that.michael barbaroDo you know what the bar is in your mind?representative jerry nadlerYes, and I’ve said it many times. I think there’s a threefold test for impeachment, really. Number one, has the president committed impeachable offenses? Number two, are those serious? And if the answer to the first two is yes, I think there’s one further test, and that is impeachment cannot be partisan. What you don’t want to do is divide the country so that half the country thinks for the next 30 years, we won the election. You stole it from us. You don’t want to embitter the country. The situation has to be such that you believe when you start the impeachment proceeding that the evidence you have is so persuasive of such terrible deeds that once the evidence is laid out, an appreciable fraction of the voters who voted for Trump will reluctantly say you had to do it. You’re not just trying to steal the election.michael barbaroBut the first two conditions you laid out — is it impeachable, is it serious — those feel quite subjective. So I wonder if any argument to impeach will inevitably feel partisan and therefore make your third —representative jerry nadlerAny argument —michael barbaro— condition hard, which is consensus?representative jerry nadler— to impeach is going to be political. Impeachment is a political task, and it’s intended to be by the Constitution. Yes, it’s going to be subjective. All political decisions are subjective. I shouldn’t say that. Almost all political decisions are subjective. But if this occurs, people are going to be on both sides, and some people will think you’re fair, and some won’t. But you have to really depend on the facts that you have at that point. You have to have very strong proof of very dire facts. And by the way, let me just step back. I’m a little concerned that we’re talking too much about impeachment. Our goal is not impeachment. Our goal is what I said a few minutes ago, to protect the rule of law, to protect the structure and functioning of government, to protect our liberties. That’s the basic goal. And if we can do that without impeachment, fine. If we have to do impeachment and if we meet the requirements so that we think we can do it, also fine.michael barbaroUnderstood. I want to ask you about some of the comments you have made ahead of the release of the Mueller report. You were asked a question, and in your response you said that you believed the president obstructed justice. And I wonder why you would —representative jerry nadlerLet me say the following. I think there is a lot of evidence the president obstructed justice, but we have to go a lot further. We have to know a lot more.michael barbaroBut I wonder why you would say that publicly before the release of the Mueller report. What’s the value in doing that? Does it not inherently portray whatever investigation —representative jerry nadlerWell, I believe in answering questions honestly. I was asked the question. I didn’t volunteer it. I was asked the question, and I said yes, I think certain things which —michael barbaroRight, and —representative jerry nadler— are in public view —michael barbaro— I like asking questions, but why not say, let’s wait until the Mueller report comes out?representative jerry nadlerWell, maybe I should have, but the fact is I think certain things that are in the public record make a strong case that there was obstruction, and other people say the same thing. But a strong case is not proof. Actually, I shouldn’t say a strong case. A lot of evidence is a better way of putting it. That’s not necessarily proof, and certainly not enough to convince the country at this point, and we have to have a lot more evidence and a lot more facts, and we need to know what the Mueller report said, and we may need to know a lot more than what the Mueller report says.michael barbaroSo re-asking the same question now that I think you were asked about 10 days or so ago, do you believe the president obstructed justice?representative jerry nadlerI think there’s a lot of evidence that he obstructed justice, and Mueller will tell us a lot more about that, and that’s one of the things we have to know.michael barbaroAre you concerned — and I appreciate you saying that maybe you shouldn’t have said it — but are you concerned that people will see this as a preconceived judgment? I know that at least some of your colleagues, like Jim Jordan, do see it that way heading into these investigations.representative jerry nadlerNo matter what I say or do, they’re going to say that. It’s the Republican strategy to say I decided to impeach the president the day after the election. It’s just an intent to distract. We haven’t decided. I haven’t decided to impeach. Some people have said that when I say, especially that third requirement, that’s a very high bar — and some people have said it may be an impossible bar. It may be. The three tests that I have said I didn’t invent. When we had the Clinton impeachment and I was a junior member of the committee, the first thing I did was to try to get my hands on everything that’s been written from Blackstone onward as to what’s an impeachable offense. But the second thing I did 20 years ago was I demanded that before we held hearings of the committee on fact, that we first hold a hearing on what’s an impeachable offense. And even though I was a minority member of the committee, I persuaded people, and we did that. And so what I’ve been talking about is basically what I got from that. I didn’t make up this test.michael barbaroWell, Congressman, I do have to point out that you said that we were talking too much about impeachment, but now you are talking about impeachment.representative jerry nadlerO.K., fair enough. But what I’m trying to say is we’re not focused on that. We will take the facts where they lead, and we’ll see.michael barbaroI want to stay with the topic of Mueller for a moment. You and your colleagues have held up Robert Mueller as a kind of gold standard of objectivity and fairness in all of this, as somebody who has the integrity, the background to kind of handle this properly. You have a lot of faith in him. Do you agree that there is basically no path to impeachment — sorry to use the word again — if the Mueller report finds no crimes?representative jerry nadlerNo, not necessarily. It depends what else we find. It depends what else is going on. There may be a lot of other things that we have to look into and that may be very damning.michael barbaroAnd as you said earlier, there is such a thing as an impeachable offense that is not a crime. Can you help us understand —representative jerry nadlerYes, they’re quite different tests.michael barbaro— what that might look like?representative jerry nadlerO.K. An impeachable offense is not a crime. Well, misuse of the pardon power, for example, misuse of other powers of the presidency. It is not true, as Mayor Giuliani has said and as a lot of other people have said, that the president has the absolute right to do this, and therefore if he does this, it cannot be wrong. The president has the right to do certain things.michael barbaroPardons, you mean.representative jerry nadlerFor example. The president has the absolute right to pardon anybody. But if the president was shown to pardon somebody in return for a $50,000 check, that would be a crime. It would also be an impeachable offense.michael barbaroOr to obstruct an investigation.representative jerry nadlerOr to obstruct an investigation — in other words, if it were shown for a corrupt motive. So the motive is what counts in a lot of these things.michael barbaroSo in November of 2016, right after President Trump was elected, you called for then-F.B.I. director James Comey to be forced out of his job because of how he handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton and his decision not to charge her with a crime yet still detail her wrongdoing for the public. We all remember that news conference and how that worked, and you called that unforgivable. If Robert Mueller says no crime has been committed when it comes to the president, would you, as head of the Judiciary Committee, still try to bring forward to the public the information behind the Mueller investigation? And if you were did you that, I wonder what’s different in your mind between what Comey did and what you would be doing?representative jerry nadlerYes. There’s a fundamental difference. The Justice Department has a very salutary general policy, and that is if you don’t indict somebody — why don’t you indict somebody? You didn’t have the evidence, obviously. You’ve investigated so and so. You’re not indicting her or him. You don’t comment negatively. You should, in a case of public notoriety, you should announce we’ve investigated. We’re not indicting him. That’s fine. But you have a policy, which the Justice Department does, that the president cannot be indicted no matter how much evidence just because he’s the president. Therefore we can’t comment on evidence against him or anything else. Then you’re converting a normally good policy into a cover-up, and you’re depriving Congress of its ability to hold the president accountable. You, the Justice Department, won’t hold him accountable because you’ve said you have no right to. You can’t indict him. That leaves only Congress, and now you’re going to deny Congress the right to the information. That makes the president unaccountable and above the law, and that cannot be.michael barbaroBut just to be clear, if Mueller says no crimes, the public still needs to see the evidence regardless, because the rules are different here.representative jerry nadlerNo, the public needs to see the evidence, number one, so it can be confident that it’s true. We’ve tried to protect Mueller because by all accounts he’s an honest guy, et cetera, et cetera, and the investigation has to proceed. But whatever he says, we can’t take it on faith. We don’t operate that way. We shouldn’t take things on faith. And if he says the president has committed crimes, we should know what the evidence is. If he says the president hasn’t committed crimes, we should know what the evidence is. And if the president hasn’t committed crimes but has done terrible things that he knows about, we should know that too. Or if the president has done nothing wrong, we should know that. The public has a great interest in the president, obviously.michael barbaroSo I just want to be very clear on why the case of Comey is different from the case of Mueller in terms of using —representative jerry nadlerEssentially because when he announced that he wasn’t indicting Hillary, it was because he thought there wasn’t enough evidence to indict Hillary, the normal reason you don’t indict somebody. If Mueller decides not to indict the president, then the public ought to know that and hear that and see the evidence on which he bases that.michael barbaroSo I want to talk to you, Congressman, about the politics of all of this and what the path forward might mean for the Democratic Party, because, as you know, the Republican Party has stood solidly behind the president this entire time. They have not budged at all. If Robert Mueller says at the end of the day that no crimes have been committed by the president, but your committee and others continue to investigate the president, are you concerned that this will inflict even more damage and partisanship on an already pretty divided and highly partisan American public —representative jerry nadlerNot if we do it responsibly —michael barbaro— and maybe hurt the Democratic Party in the process?representative jerry nadlerNot if we do it responsibly. Congress must hold the executive accountable. And that is with respect to crimes. It’s respect to bad deeds. It’s respect to corruption, et cetera, and it’s respect to policy. We have to provide the accountability, and we have to let the American people know what is being done in their names, and let them judge.michael barbaroBut how do you explain to the American people, who are pretty exhausted by all this, why you’re going to keep pursuing an investigation after Mueller —representative jerry nadlerWell, it depends what he says and how much he covers, and that will help determine how much we have left to do. And the answer is that we can’t rely on others to do the work for us. We have an obligation to do our own work. That’s why we were elected. And at the end of the day, the American people decide not the week after Mueller releases his report but election day next year whether we have acted responsibly or irresponsibly in a partisan or reasonable way.michael barbaroWell, would you put your belief in the need to pursue the facts over the short-term well-being of the Democratic Party if those two things seem to turn out to be at odds with one another and in conflict?representative jerry nadlerI think it’s my constitutional duty to do so.michael barbaroThis may sound a little corny, but in this moment, with everyone waiting for what’s next, what message do you want to give to Americans on what we can see as kind of the eve of the Mueller report?representative jerry nadlerWhat message? That, one, we have an administration that has attacked the institutions of government and of liberty on which we depend on in fundamental ways, and we have to rein it in. We have to make sure that the separation of powers is maintained and that liberty and the rule of law is maintained, and that the Mueller report will give us hopefully a lot of information, but that Congress has to do the job we were elected to do. And that the administration has to understand that the American people elected a Congress that wants to hold the administration accountable, and we will do that, and the Mueller report will help us do that to a greater or lesser extent, but it’s fundamentally our job.michael barbaroCongressman, thank you for your time. We really appreciate it.representative jerry nadlerYou’re welcome.

But it has yet to be made public, and the path to its potential release — or the release of the facts it contains — is complicated.Will the report be made public?That remains to be seen. Some information is expected to come out because Mr. Barr has to update Congress, but that does not mean the entire report will be public.Mr. Barr sent a letter to the leaders of Congress’s judiciary committees that the special counsel investigation has been completed, which he is required to do, according to the special counsel regulation. Mr. Barr said that he was reviewing Mr. Mueller’s report and might be able to provide lawmakers with the special counsel’s “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend.ImageThe regulation also requires that Mr. Barr tell the lawmakers whether he or his predecessors overseeing it opposed any significant step that Mr. Mueller sought to take. Mr. Barr said “there were no such instances” during the investigation.The special counsel regulation sets no time frame or deadline for when Mr. Barr must provide this information to Congress.Mr. Barr is required only to provide lawmakers with very basic facts. He would be operating within the guidelines of the regulation if he were to give Congress a bare-bones notification that Mr. Mueller had concluded his work. In his letter on Friday, Mr. Barr said he planned to consult with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and Mr. Mueller about what other details from the report could be given to Congress and the public.According to the Justice Department’s explanation of the regulation, published in the Federal Register in 1999, Mr. Barr has to determine whether releasing the report, or portions of it, is in the public’s interest. Mr. Barr has said repeatedly that he would release as much as he could from the report within the parameters of the special counsel regulations.But, first, Mr. Barr and his aides will have to review the report to determine whether any information is classified or otherwise sensitive, or protected by privacy laws or executive privilege, which can be invoked for sensitive law enforcement materials.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe back and forth on what information Congress can and cannot have will most likely be drawn out and have to be resolved by a court.Will Congress be satisfied with a bare-bones report?No.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has already called for the entire report, without redactions, to be provided to lawmakers.“Regulations governing Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation do not prohibit Attorney General Barr from disclosing Mueller’s final report and investigative materials to Congress,” Ms. Feinstein said in February.And the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for the report to be made public — a largely symbolic move to pressure Mr. Barr publicly to release it.Democrats in the House have also already made the case that seeing the report in its entirety is critical to their ability to conduct oversight and determine whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.“Congress could be the only institution currently situated to act on evidence of the president’s misconduct,” the chairmen of several House committees wrote in a Feb. 22 letter to Mr. Barr.Further, they wrote, Congress should decide what should be redacted in the report.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said that she does not support impeaching Mr. Trump without support from Republican lawmakers because it is too divisive for the country. Barring new shocking revelations about Mr. Trump, Democrats would prefer to beat Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election.What if the administration rejects Congress’s requests?Lawmakers have a few options to try to make public details of the investigation, though some could involve years of litigation.They could start issuing subpoenas to Mr. Barr, who could ignore them or refuse them. They could also subpoena Mr. Mueller’s testimony. The Justice Department is likely to resist those demands.If that happens, lawmakers could hold them in contempt and ask the United States attorney for the District of Columbia to prosecute. Lawmakers could also sue to try to force the Trump administration to hand over the requested material. Such litigation could go on for years.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.The White House could also try to negotiate with Congress, such as making some witnesses available, but not all, said Richard H. Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University Law School. The White House is also likely to challenge some requests and assert that the requested information is available to lawmakers through other means.Lawmakers can also use their bully pulpits to pressure Mr. Barr publicly for more information and tie up the Justice Department in hearings and subpoena fights that last for the rest of Mr. Trump’s time in office.Will the president even see the report?That is not clear.Mr. Trump is Mr. Barr’s boss, and there is nothing to stop Mr. Barr from immediately sharing the report with the White House, Mr. Pildes said. But doing so would violate the Justice Department’s longstanding independence from the White House, said Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor who ran the department’s Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush administration.And if the Mueller report includes grand jury testimony, which is protected under federal law, the number of people permitted to see the report shrinks significantly. Mr. Trump, as president, would be permitted to see it in certain circumstances.For example, according to a 1993 opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, grand jury information may be disclosed to the president if it relates to his role in helping the department decide how to enforce the law, or if it relates to a national security threat.In another Justice Department legal opinion, written in 2000, the president may have access to grand jury material if it is used as part of his consideration for a pardon. There has been a great deal of discussion about whether Mr. Trump would give presidential pardons to his former aides who have been charged in Mr. Mueller’s investigation, such as Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was sentenced to a total of seven and a half years in prison in two cases.What if he tweets inaccuracies about the findings?Even if Mr. Mueller and Mr. Barr know that what Mr. Trump is saying publicly is not true, there is no apparent legal duty for the Justice Department to correct the president.Will this be the final word on “collusion”?Unlikely.First, collusion has no legal definition, though it has become a term of art as a shorthand reference to the Russia investigation.A key question in the special counsel investigation concerns whether Mr. Trump or his campaign was coordinating with Russia to try to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. If Mr. Mueller’s investigation ends without charging Mr. Trump or his aides with conspiracy, some may interpret that to be a “no collusion” finding.Mr. Trump consistently cites government officials and the lack of collusion charges as evidence that there was never collusion between his campaign and Russia.Charlie Savage and Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Mueller III, and his team are said to be finishing their report, almost two years in the making, into possible Russian collusion and obstruction of justice by President Trump and those close to him. Four Times journalists who have been covering the developments closely, Amy Fiscus, Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman and Katie Benner, dialed into a conference call with New York Times subscribers on Thursday morning. (Listen to the audio in full here.) They discussed their experience covering the story and answered questions from readers about the continuing investigation. Read a lightly edited excerpt from their conversation, led by Ms. Fiscus, here.Amy Fiscus What questions are you each looking for this report to answer? What have been your white whales of covering this investigation?Mark Mazzetti There are so many, since we’ve all been at this for so long. We have written so much about Russia, we’ve written about the different aspects of what’s been called the “collusion case,” we’ve written about Middle Eastern countries having a role in this investigation. I think it’s going to be, to a degree, unsatisfying if, as we expect, the report is less expansive than we might want. And that’s going to then set us up to go report out exactly what they knew about the evidence and why they decided not to bring charges. But I do think, stepping back, it’s important to say that if you look at the breadth of what Mueller has done so far, these indictments are incredibly detailed. And far more than is normal, in many cases. And so even if this final “report” is less expansive than we might think, if you go back and look at the, for instance, two big Russia indictments, they’re filled with information that is based on highly classified information that really does tell a narrative of what the Russians did in advance of the 2016 election, which is pretty breathtaking.Katie Benner Mueller has not yet indicted any member of the Trump campaign for working with Russia. He’s largely indicted them for lying, but not for colluding with Russia. So the open question is, will the president be found to have worked with Russia or tried to obstruct justice?Maggie Haberman I was going to say, the point that I’m really looking toward is what it says about obstruction of justice or attempted obstruction of justice. Does Mueller draw any conclusions in the report or make any recommendations, or does he just do a laying-out of facts and explain how they came to learn certain information and where it’s coming from? And then how rough the language is about the president. Even if the report is a couple dozen pages, a couple paragraphs about the president could or could not be pretty damning.Amy Fiscus I wanted to ask you guys more of a personal question about the past couple of years and being on the front lines of this.

Washington Barely Handled the AnticipationAdvertisementSupported byWhere’s the Mueller Report? Washington Barely Handled the AnticipationImageJournalists waiting outside the Justice Department on Friday. As the hours ticked by, it seemed as if the report might never be delivered.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Katie Rogers and Katie BennerMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The president’s lawyer had no clue when the report might arrive, or if it even would.Seated alone amid the tourists at the Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House on Friday, Rudolph W. Giuliani scrolled through a tablet with one hand and held a cellphone in the other as he waited for the news that the long-awaited report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, was done and had finally been delivered to the Justice Department.“Keep in touch,” he said to the person on the other end of the phone. “Tell me what’s going on, O.K.?”Like the rest of Washington, Mr. Giuliani was tired of waiting.“They said it was going to be at noon or 12:30,” Mr. Giuliani told a reporter who approached him around half-past 1 p.m. According to his sources — according to everyone’s sources — Mr. Mueller was late to deliver on a report that has enthralled the capital, bedeviled the president and, at times, enticed the nation.As the hours ticked by, it seemed as if the report might never come. But at some point during the afternoon, unbeknown to the curious public and TV camera crews, a security officer from the special counsel’s office arrived at the Justice Department to deliver the report to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Within minutes, it was in the hands of William P. Barr, the attorney general.At 4:05 p.m., a thunderclap rumbled around the capital, and hail began to fall. Fifty-five minutes later the skies cleared, and it was announced that Mr. Barr had finally received the report. And by the time Mr. Barr was sitting in his office on the fifth floor of the Justice Department on Friday night, reading the report — he was among a few people, including Mr. Rosenstein, who had access to it — Mr. Giuliani, who had been in the dark for much of the day, had changed his tone.“We are confident the attorney general will make the right decision,” Mr. Giuliani said in a statement. “He has to consider the legal matters and rules. I’m confident he’ll make the right call.”[The special counsel has submitted his full report on Mr. Trump and Russia to the attorney general, who now must decide how much of it to release.]The assurance of the report’s delivery was the capstone to a day marked by just how little anyone really knew.Beginning in the early morning, reporters and photographers clustered around the office building just blocks south of the National Mall where the special counsel has offices. At least a half-dozen news cameras positioned themselves outside the building’s garage, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Mueller driving his sensible Subaru into a colorless, bureaucratic-looking complex.“I have the report in my purse!” one woman joked as she walked by.At one point, as two of Mr. Mueller’s investigators left for lunch, they noticed the cluster of cameras and quickly turned to cross the street. By 2 p.m., an increasingly impatient group wanted a sign of something — anything — that could hint at Mueller-related activity a mile away at the Justice Department’s headquarters.Cameras flashed when two lead prosecutors investigating Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice — James L. Quarles III and Andrew D. Goldstein — left together in a BMW sedan headed in that direction. Rumors that had hatched about a noon report arrival were scuttled once Mr. Barr grabbed lunch in the department’s subterranean cafeteria.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Outside, a lone protester got in on the action. The man, who would identify himself only as “T. Pardy,” told a reporter that the special counsel investigation was “the fruit of the poison tree.” He then began to bang on a five-gallon bucket, screaming “FISA abuse.”Not everyone took such a theatrical approach to the wait.Newt Gingrich, an occasional adviser to the president who as the House speaker vigorously defended the work of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, said that he had taken a laid-back approach to the report’s arrival.Mr. Gingrich said in an interview that the public should get the chance to see Mr. Mueller’s report once it was in Mr. Barr’s hands — with “obvious exceptions,” he added.Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing.“First of all, it may be interesting,” Mr. Gingrich said. “Second of all, it may actually tell us something.”A low-key approach was similarly adopted at the White House, starting with the president.“I have no idea about the Mueller report,” Mr. Trump told a cluster of journalists in the morning before boarding Marine One and departing for Mar-a-Lago, his winter retreat in Florida.As the day drew on, observers on Twitter began placing their bets about the report’s whereabouts, creating fictional explanations about Mr. Mueller’s activities.“Robert Mueller sweating in front of his laptop, staring at a Word doc containing only the words ‘The Mueller Report’ and a blinking cursor,” the comedian Patrick Monahan wrote on Twitter, trying his hand at fan fiction.At that point, not even Peter Carr, Mr. Mueller’s famously tight-lipped spokesman, could seem to resist the fun people were having. “Ha,” Mr. Carr wrote in response to an NBC reporter who sent along Mr. Monahan’s tweet.Back at the White House, a cluster of aides who remained in the West Wing area accessible to journalists turned off the television. They seemed more concerned with a flooding issue that had emerged from Thursday’s rains than the contents of the report, or when it might come.When it finally did come, the White House, which has led Trump supporters in a “witch hunt” chant at various points over the years, struck a relatively formal tone.“The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said on Twitter. “The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”But there was one indicator that Mr. Mueller’s report was at least somewhere near the back of the president’s mind: Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer for the president in the special counsel investigation, accompanied him to Palm Beach.After top Justice Department officials in Washington looked through the report, Mr. Barr’s chief of staff, Brian Rabbitt, called Mr. Flood just after 4:30 p.m. to let him know that the department had the report, and gave Mr. Flood a readout of the letter that would be delivered to Congress.The letter contained important details, including the fact that Mr. Barr’s summary of Mr. Mueller’s key findings could be sent to members of Congress as early as this weekend.The letter also said that there were no instances when Mr. Rosenstein; Matthew P. Whitaker, the former acting attorney general; or Mr. Barr told Mr. Mueller that he could not pursue an investigative action.Back at the Trump International Hotel, the speculation began. As she tucked herself into a booth, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, told a reporter that she had no idea when the report would come out before an aide shut down the conversation.At the bar, a pair of state prosecutors in town from Florida were enjoying a glass of wine and watching coverage of the Mueller report on two large televisions — one tuned to CNN, the other to Fox News.“I’ve stopped being surprised at the allegations,” one of them, Bill Beaver, said, adding that he wanted to see what the report actually contained before making a judgment. “We base our jobs in facts.”Reporting was contributed by Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, Michael D.

This is “The Daily.” Today: As the special counsel finishes his investigation, he can pursue three different paths — each one with a profoundly different impact on how Congress will proceed. Why recent history makes one of those paths especially treacherous. Part 2 of what to expect from the Mueller report. It’s Monday, March 11. Mike Schmidt, you are arguably the best-sourced reporter in Washington. When is the Mueller report going to come out? And what is it going to say?michael schmidtI don’t know, and I don’t know.michael barbaro(LAUGHS) No, but seriously — best guess?michael schmidtBest guess — sometime in the next month or so. But I don’t want to be in a position saying that, because a lot of our colleagues at other places have tried to put an end date on an investigation.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtAnd that’s a very dangerous place to be as a reporter.michael barbaroYeah, I was just joking.michael schmidtI’m just — there’s no joking in special counsels. [MUSIC]michael barbaroO.K. So we know that the report will be coming out relatively soon. We don’t know precisely when — which is why, last week, we spoke to Neal Katyal, the guy who wrote the special counsel rules that have been guiding Robert Mueller. And he talked to us about the form and the size that this report would take. And I want to talk to you, Mike, about its actual contents and conclusions. What are those likely to be?michael schmidtSo the president is being investigated for whether he obstructed justice or has been a witting or unwitting agent of Russia. So there are three possibilities. The first possibility is that the report could say he broke the law — that he either obstructed justice or is indeed an agent of this foreign power.michael barbaroAnd if that’s the case — that Mueller recommends charging the president with a crime, which would be a very big deal — what would happen next?michael schmidtThe attorney general, Bill Barr, would have to decide whether to take the extraordinary decision of indicting the president or to follow Justice Department policy, which says that a president should not be indicted while they’re in office. It’s hard to imagine a scenario which Barr doesn’t follow the policy.michael barbaroWhich says do not indict the president.michael schmidtCorrect. If that’s what they conclude, they also believe that the only place to deal with wrongdoing by the president is Congress. So that information, that evidence against the president, needs to go to the House.michael barbaroO.K. So in that scenario, the special counsel makes the case that there’s sufficient evidence to charge the president, and yet the attorney general, because of a legal interpretation he has, will not want to bring such a charge against the president. And from our conversation with Neal Katyal, we know that that information — to charge or not to charge — will have to be laid out to Congress. And Congress will receive that information from the attorney general. So then what happens?michael schmidtThe Democrats in the House would take it, and they’d say, oh, my gosh. Bob Mueller wanted to indict the president. We are going to take this and begin impeachment proceedings. It’s hard to see Mueller saying the president broke the law and the Democrats saying, O.K., we’re going to take a pass here.michael barbaroEspecially if they feel that such a charge was impeded in your scenario by the attorney general.michael schmidtThere was a good little episode that occurred around this several weeks ago that I thought gave us great insight. BuzzFeed posted their story that said that the president had asked Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtBig deal, anonymously sourced — within an hour or two, members of the House, leading Democrats, are talking about impeachment. That was the reaction. Now, we know the BuzzFeed story becomes a whole different thing.michael barbaroComplicated, unproven.michael schmidtComplicated, et cetera, knocked down by Mueller — but you think if the House of Representatives, the Democrats there, are told by Mueller, I think the president broke the law, that they’re not going to move towards impeachment? If they were willing to move towards impeachment based on an anonymously based story, you think that with all the weight they had put into Mueller — they have held Mueller up in such high esteem for two years, done all these things to try and protect him — that they won’t move as quickly as possible in that direction? Look, we’re trying to predict the future here, which is difficult. But I don’t see it turning out a different way, at least at this point.michael barbaroO.K. So in this scenario with a report that says the president committed crimes, it would give the Democrats license to investigate everything that they have said that they want to investigate, even beyond the limited scope of the Mueller investigation — all seemingly in an effort to get to impeachment and the removal of the president from office.michael schmidtLook, the Democrats are going to investigate the president regardless of this. What a Mueller report saying the president broke the law would do is give the political wind directly at the back of the Democrats and push them hard in an impeachment direction, but also put pressure on Republicans. That’s the difference. It will push Republicans in a way that we haven’t seen before. And the other thing — Republicans have hung with the president throughout all of this. They have seen how he has behaved for the past two years, and they’ve said, we’re O.K. with this. So maybe they’ll continue there, but a strong Mueller report would be the greatest test of that that we’ve seen.michael barbaroSo that is the brightest possible green light for House Democrats to dig and dig and proceed with their investigations.michael schmidtCorrect. [MUSIC]michael barbaroO.K. That is the first possibility for how this proceeds. What is the second possibility, Mike?michael schmidtMueller says, I’ve investigated for nearly two years and have found no evidence that the president broke the law or that he’s an agent of a foreign power. And Mueller’s investigation could have found very unsavory political things about the president, but that doesn’t mean he broke the law. And we don’t have enough evidence to clear that high bar of proving that the president broke the law. And here are my findings.michael barbaroSo essentially not enough evidence to charge — no charges?michael schmidtBest outcome for the president.michael barbaroAnd what are the implications of that from Mueller for the Democrats in Congress?michael schmidtThat type of ending of the investigation would be very, very damaging to the ambitions of the Democrats to fully investigate the president and impeach him. It takes all the wind out of their sails, because here they are — have said, we will wait until we see Mueller’s report before moving forward with something like impeachment. We need to see what Mueller found. And O.K., here’s Mueller’s findings. He doesn’t have any evidence the president broke the law. That really hurts the Democrats’ argument that they need to spend all of their time and energy looking into his conduct.michael barbaroBut Mike, the Democrats are investigating the president beyond what Mueller was looking into. So I wonder about all the other lines of inquiry — the ones about the Trump Organization, campaign finance, hush money payments, all the stuff, for example, that the Southern District of New York is looking into.michael schmidtCorrect. There’s still all sorts of questions about the campaign, about the inaugural committee, about the president’s business dealings, about the president’s daughter and son-in-law’s security clearance. So there’s rich areas to be looked into. But I don’t think those investigations will move forward with the same fervor and potential support from the average American or Republican that those types of inquiries definitely need to happen. And part of that is because the Democrats have put so much emphasis on Mueller. The Republicans have showed that they are going to stick with Donald Trump based on the current political atmosphere. So if Mueller says, there’s nothing here to be seen, then the Republicans — we know where they’re going to be. They’re going to be standing next to the president.michael barbaroSo in that case, do you expect the Democrats would proceed with these investigations, but they would kind of limp along and there wouldn’t be a ton of political support for anything approaching impeachment, no matter what is found? Or is it possible these investigations would literally just start to shut down?michael schmidtI don’t think they shut down. I think that they limp along, because the Democrats will still have a base that thinks that Trump has done a lot of things that are terrible. And there will be pressure on them to continue to press. Democrats will say, Mueller may not have enough evidence to show the president broke the law, but we know that he has abused his power and done X and Y and Z. And they’ll go on and on and on, and they’ll say we can not ignore this.michael barbaroSo if the answer is no crimes from Mueller, the Democrats and the Republicans basically will proceed as they have been proceeding, but the Democrats will have a much harder road to travel in their pursuit of investigations and potentially impeaching the president.michael schmidtI think they’ll be less interest from the public, because the public will say, O.K., we know there’s been this investigation for the past two years. We think it was done by this guy that everyone seems to trust. He found that the president didn’t break the law. So why are all these other investigations going on? You have to think of it from the view of the person who hasn’t been following every whiff and blow of this. Well, what about the security clearance for Jared Kushner — and from the average perspective, they’ll say, look, all this stuff was looked at. It’s nothing here, so why am I still paying attention to this? [MUSIC]michael barbaroSo Mike, what could possibly be the third option? Because in our legal system, when it comes to the special counsel, there only seems to be two options — charge the president with a crime or not charge the president.michael schmidtFor lack of a better term or to make up a term, I would call it the Comey hybrid.michael barbaroWhat is — (CHUCKLES) what is the Comey hybrid?michael schmidtLet’s go back to July of 2016.archived recording (james comey)Good morning.michael schmidtThe F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, holds a surprise press conference.archived recording (james comey)I’m here to give you an update on the F.B.I.‘s investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as secretary of state.michael schmidtTo say to the public, here’s what we found in our investigation.archived recording (james comey)This is going to be an unusual statement in at least a couple of ways. First, I’m going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.michael schmidtLaying out that classified information had been found in Clinton’s emails.archived recording (james comey)There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the top-secret special access program at the time they were sent and received.michael schmidtThat she had been careless in how she handled national security secrets.archived recording (james comey)There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.michael schmidtBut that at the end of the day —archived recording (james comey)Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.michael schmidtIt didn’t meet the high bar of indicting her.archived recording (james comey)We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.michael barbaroSo a Comey hybrid is to come out and say no charges are going to be filed against the subject of an investigation, but here are all the things we found. Here are all the implications — essentially not prosecution, but a kind of scolding.michael schmidtIt’s not even about scolding. It’s — we’re not going to charge, but I’m going to give you a rare look underneath the hood.archived recording (james comey)Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system in violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified information, either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way.michael schmidtThis was a very big-time investigation that the entire country has been paying attention to. If we stand up here and say we’re not going to charge a crime, then the public will not take it seriously unless we show them our homework. And here is our homework.archived recording (james comey)F.B.I. investigators also read all of the approximately 30,000 emails that Secretary Clinton provided to the State Department in 2014.michael schmidtThat a Justice Department, which is controlled by one political party or the other, needs to be more forthcoming about what they have found to make the argument to the average person that their decision has been based on the evidence and not political favor.archived recording (james comey)I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout the investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done honestly, competently and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation, including people in government, but none of that mattered to us.michael schmidtHe thinks a storm is coming from the Republicans who control Congress at the time. And he’s trying to inoculate the F.B.I. from that by saying, here’s what we found, here’s why we decided what we did — because he thought that he could use the facts of what they found as a shield to explain his decision.michael barbaroAnd how likely is Mueller to replicate that model?michael schmidtMy guess is highly unlikely.michael barbaroWhy?michael schmidtBecause Jim Comey has been blasted for what he did in that press conference and painted as someone who was using a criminal process to dirty up Clinton politically — that in this country, the Democrats would argue, you should not use a criminal process to undermine someone politically. And that’s what his press conference did.michael barbaroSo the conclusion was that it was an unnecessary, kind of gratuitous sullying of Hillary Clinton, even though there was no evidence she had committed a crime.michael schmidtCorrect. They’re saying if the F.B.I. investigated the average American and found that that person had not committed a crime, we don’t then stand up and say, hey, look at all the unsavory things they did — which we didn’t think rose to something they should be charged with.michael barbaroRight, because Comey could have just come out and said, we’re finished. There are no crimes. Thank you for coming. See you soon.michael schmidtCorrect. But Comey’s argument was if I had not done that, no one would have taken the decision seriously.michael barbaroSo you think that because of what Comey did and the reaction to it, Robert Mueller is very unlikely to make the same decision. He won’t employ the Comey hybrid, as you have deemed it, and instead we’ll probably get a pretty black-and-white Mueller report. It will either be crimes or no crimes — not some hybrid where the homework is shown.michael schmidtIf we’re sitting here trying to predict the future of an investigation we have little insight into, sure.michael barbaroO.K. [MUSIC] Mike, so far we have been talking almost exclusively about Mueller’s assessment of President Trump himself. But as we know, Mueller has been investigating the entire apparatus around the president, and he has already indicted dozens of people. So I wonder if in this final report, the biggest finding may not be about the president, but about the people close to him. For example, he could find that President Trump’s sons have committed some kind of crime — his lawyers, people who work at the Trump Organization.michael schmidtI’m not sure what that would change politically, though.michael barbaroTell me what you mean.michael schmidtThe president’s former national security advisor, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer have all been indicted — all people closely associated with him, closely associated with the campaign, closely associated with crimes. And that didn’t move Republicans politically on the president. So why would more drops in that puddle make a difference? Do you think there’s a tipping point? Is there a straw that you think that would break the Republicans’ back on this? I think that straw is evidence that the president broke the law. I don’t think it’s more evidence that others around the president broke the law.michael barbaroSo it really only matters whether Mueller recommends bringing charges against the president?michael schmidtIn my assessment, based on what we know, I think that makes the most sense.michael barbaroWhich is kind of fascinating, because we have been waiting 22 months, and what you’re kind of suggesting here is that, in the end, all these other indictments, all these other charges, all these other characters — those may end up being kind of irrelevant when it comes to the politics surrounding the future of this investigation if the president is not charged.michael schmidtWe already know so much. President’s personal lawyer has pled guilty twice in two separate investigations involving the president. President’s former campaign chairman has been charged two separate indictments.michael barbaroPaul Manafort.michael schmidtSo why would more of that be any different? I don’t think that’s the factor that drives this story forward in a different direction.michael barbaroBut isn’t there a world, Mike, where Democrats in Congress decide they don’t really care about the political winds. They don’t really care whether Republicans think their investigation is legitimate. They don’t really care what the public may think about the investigation. They put their heads down. They keep investigating. And because the scope of their investigation is much broader than that of Robert Mueller, they find something very significant, very damning, and it leads to a political process that could lead to impeachment.michael schmidtYeah. And they impeach him in the House, without the political backing of Mueller saying the president broke the law, and it goes to the Senate, and no Republicans come along. And it dies. And Donald Trump runs on, look at the witch hunt that impeached me in the House. And they couldn’t get it done in the Senate, and here I am running for re-election in 2020. They arm him with the ability to say, look at what they did to me. [MUSIC] And you have to remember that, of course, there’s stones out there that Mueller may not have looked under, but ultimately, Congress does not have the powers that Mueller had for his investigation. Mueller had a grand jury. He could use wiretaps. He could dip his hands into whatever the intelligence community had. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his investigators have a limited subpoena power, and they’re seen as political investigators. So it’s hard to think that if Mueller, in nearly two years of rummaging around Trump’s life, didn’t find it, that Nadler will.michael barbaroThank you, Michael.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroOn tomorrow’s “Daily,” a conversation with Representative Jerry Nadler.The DailySubscribe:Apple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsPart 2: What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report)We look at three possible outcomes of the special counsel investigation, which is believed to be wrapping up soon.Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett and Rachel Quester, and edited by Lisa TobinMore episodes ofThe DailyApril 16, 2019  •  28:05The Rise and Fall of Carlos GhosnApril 15, 2019  •  30:02The Moral Complexities of Working With Julian AssangeApril 12, 2019Israel’s Election, Through the Eyes of a Young PalestinianApril 11, 2019  •  28:40Netanyahu Won.

What a Mueller report saying the president broke the law would do is give the political wind directly at the back of the Democrats and push them hard in an impeachment direction, but also put pressure on Republicans. That’s the difference. It will push Republicans in a way that we haven’t seen before. And the other thing — Republicans have hung with the president throughout all of this. They have seen how he has behaved for the past two years, and they’ve said, we’re O.K. with this. So maybe they’ll continue there, but a strong Mueller report would be the greatest test of that that we’ve seen.michael barbaroSo that is the brightest possible green light for House Democrats to dig and dig and proceed with their investigations.michael schmidtCorrect. [MUSIC]michael barbaroO.K. That is the first possibility for how this proceeds. What is the second possibility, Mike?michael schmidtMueller says, I’ve investigated for nearly two years and have found no evidence that the president broke the law or that he’s an agent of a foreign power. And Mueller’s investigation could have found very unsavory political things about the president, but that doesn’t mean he broke the law. And we don’t have enough evidence to clear that high bar of proving that the president broke the law. And here are my findings.michael barbaroSo essentially not enough evidence to charge — no charges?michael schmidtBest outcome for the president.michael barbaroAnd what are the implications of that from Mueller for the Democrats in Congress?michael schmidtThat type of ending of the investigation would be very, very damaging to the ambitions of the Democrats to fully investigate the president and impeach him. It takes all the wind out of their sails, because here they are — have said, we will wait until we see Mueller’s report before moving forward with something like impeachment. We need to see what Mueller found. And O.K., here’s Mueller’s findings. He doesn’t have any evidence the president broke the law. That really hurts the Democrats’ argument that they need to spend all of their time and energy looking into his conduct.michael barbaroBut Mike, the Democrats are investigating the president beyond what Mueller was looking into. So I wonder about all the other lines of inquiry — the ones about the Trump Organization, campaign finance, hush money payments, all the stuff, for example, that the Southern District of New York is looking into.michael schmidtCorrect. There’s still all sorts of questions about the campaign, about the inaugural committee, about the president’s business dealings, about the president’s daughter and son-in-law’s security clearance. So there’s rich areas to be looked into. But I don’t think those investigations will move forward with the same fervor and potential support from the average American or Republican that those types of inquiries definitely need to happen. And part of that is because the Democrats have put so much emphasis on Mueller. The Republicans have showed that they are going to stick with Donald Trump based on the current political atmosphere. So if Mueller says, there’s nothing here to be seen, then the Republicans — we know where they’re going to be. They’re going to be standing next to the president.michael barbaroSo in that case, do you expect the Democrats would proceed with these investigations, but they would kind of limp along and there wouldn’t be a ton of political support for anything approaching impeachment, no matter what is found? Or is it possible these investigations would literally just start to shut down?michael schmidtI don’t think they shut down. I think that they limp along, because the Democrats will still have a base that thinks that Trump has done a lot of things that are terrible. And there will be pressure on them to continue to press. Democrats will say, Mueller may not have enough evidence to show the president broke the law, but we know that he has abused his power and done X and Y and Z. And they’ll go on and on and on, and they’ll say we can not ignore this.michael barbaroSo if the answer is no crimes from Mueller, the Democrats and the Republicans basically will proceed as they have been proceeding, but the Democrats will have a much harder road to travel in their pursuit of investigations and potentially impeaching the president.michael schmidtI think they’ll be less interest from the public, because the public will say, O.K., we know there’s been this investigation for the past two years. We think it was done by this guy that everyone seems to trust. He found that the president didn’t break the law. So why are all these other investigations going on? You have to think of it from the view of the person who hasn’t been following every whiff and blow of this. Well, what about the security clearance for Jared Kushner — and from the average perspective, they’ll say, look, all this stuff was looked at. It’s nothing here, so why am I still paying attention to this? [MUSIC]michael barbaroSo Mike, what could possibly be the third option? Because in our legal system, when it comes to the special counsel, there only seems to be two options — charge the president with a crime or not charge the president.michael schmidtFor lack of a better term or to make up a term, I would call it the Comey hybrid.michael barbaroWhat is — (CHUCKLES) what is the Comey hybrid?michael schmidtLet’s go back to July of 2016.archived recording (james comey)Good morning.michael schmidtThe F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, holds a surprise press conference.archived recording (james comey)I’m here to give you an update on the F.B.I.‘s investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as secretary of state.michael schmidtTo say to the public, here’s what we found in our investigation.archived recording (james comey)This is going to be an unusual statement in at least a couple of ways. First, I’m going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.michael schmidtLaying out that classified information had been found in Clinton’s emails.archived recording (james comey)There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the top-secret special access program at the time they were sent and received.michael schmidtThat she had been careless in how she handled national security secrets.archived recording (james comey)There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.michael schmidtBut that at the end of the day —archived recording (james comey)Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.michael schmidtIt didn’t meet the high bar of indicting her.archived recording (james comey)We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.michael barbaroSo a Comey hybrid is to come out and say no charges are going to be filed against the subject of an investigation, but here are all the things we found. Here are all the implications — essentially not prosecution, but a kind of scolding.michael schmidtIt’s not even about scolding. It’s — we’re not going to charge, but I’m going to give you a rare look underneath the hood.archived recording (james comey)Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system in violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified information, either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way.michael schmidtThis was a very big-time investigation that the entire country has been paying attention to. If we stand up here and say we’re not going to charge a crime, then the public will not take it seriously unless we show them our homework. And here is our homework.archived recording (james comey)F.B.I. investigators also read all of the approximately 30,000 emails that Secretary Clinton provided to the State Department in 2014.michael schmidtThat a Justice Department, which is controlled by one political party or the other, needs to be more forthcoming about what they have found to make the argument to the average person that their decision has been based on the evidence and not political favor.archived recording (james comey)I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout the investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done honestly, competently and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation, including people in government, but none of that mattered to us.michael schmidtHe thinks a storm is coming from the Republicans who control Congress at the time. And he’s trying to inoculate the F.B.I. from that by saying, here’s what we found, here’s why we decided what we did — because he thought that he could use the facts of what they found as a shield to explain his decision.michael barbaroAnd how likely is Mueller to replicate that model?michael schmidtMy guess is highly unlikely.michael barbaroWhy?michael schmidtBecause Jim Comey has been blasted for what he did in that press conference and painted as someone who was using a criminal process to dirty up Clinton politically — that in this country, the Democrats would argue, you should not use a criminal process to undermine someone politically. And that’s what his press conference did.michael barbaroSo the conclusion was that it was an unnecessary, kind of gratuitous sullying of Hillary Clinton, even though there was no evidence she had committed a crime.michael schmidtCorrect. They’re saying if the F.B.I. investigated the average American and found that that person had not committed a crime, we don’t then stand up and say, hey, look at all the unsavory things they did — which we didn’t think rose to something they should be charged with.michael barbaroRight, because Comey could have just come out and said, we’re finished. There are no crimes. Thank you for coming. See you soon.michael schmidtCorrect. But Comey’s argument was if I had not done that, no one would have taken the decision seriously.michael barbaroSo you think that because of what Comey did and the reaction to it, Robert Mueller is very unlikely to make the same decision. He won’t employ the Comey hybrid, as you have deemed it, and instead we’ll probably get a pretty black-and-white Mueller report. It will either be crimes or no crimes — not some hybrid where the homework is shown.michael schmidtIf we’re sitting here trying to predict the future of an investigation we have little insight into, sure.michael barbaroO.K. [MUSIC] Mike, so far we have been talking almost exclusively about Mueller’s assessment of President Trump himself. But as we know, Mueller has been investigating the entire apparatus around the president, and he has already indicted dozens of people. So I wonder if in this final report, the biggest finding may not be about the president, but about the people close to him. For example, he could find that President Trump’s sons have committed some kind of crime — his lawyers, people who work at the Trump Organization.michael schmidtI’m not sure what that would change politically, though.michael barbaroTell me what you mean.michael schmidtThe president’s former national security advisor, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer have all been indicted — all people closely associated with him, closely associated with the campaign, closely associated with crimes. And that didn’t move Republicans politically on the president. So why would more drops in that puddle make a difference? Do you think there’s a tipping point? Is there a straw that you think that would break the Republicans’ back on this? I think that straw is evidence that the president broke the law. I don’t think it’s more evidence that others around the president broke the law.michael barbaroSo it really only matters whether Mueller recommends bringing charges against the president?michael schmidtIn my assessment, based on what we know, I think that makes the most sense.michael barbaroWhich is kind of fascinating, because we have been waiting 22 months, and what you’re kind of suggesting here is that, in the end, all these other indictments, all these other charges, all these other characters — those may end up being kind of irrelevant when it comes to the politics surrounding the future of this investigation if the president is not charged.michael schmidtWe already know so much. President’s personal lawyer has pled guilty twice in two separate investigations involving the president. President’s former campaign chairman has been charged two separate indictments.michael barbaroPaul Manafort.michael schmidtSo why would more of that be any different? I don’t think that’s the factor that drives this story forward in a different direction.michael barbaroBut isn’t there a world, Mike, where Democrats in Congress decide they don’t really care about the political winds. They don’t really care whether Republicans think their investigation is legitimate. They don’t really care what the public may think about the investigation. They put their heads down. They keep investigating. And because the scope of their investigation is much broader than that of Robert Mueller, they find something very significant, very damning, and it leads to a political process that could lead to impeachment.michael schmidtYeah. And they impeach him in the House, without the political backing of Mueller saying the president broke the law, and it goes to the Senate, and no Republicans come along. And it dies. And Donald Trump runs on, look at the witch hunt that impeached me in the House. And they couldn’t get it done in the Senate, and here I am running for re-election in 2020. They arm him with the ability to say, look at what they did to me. [MUSIC] And you have to remember that, of course, there’s stones out there that Mueller may not have looked under, but ultimately, Congress does not have the powers that Mueller had for his investigation. Mueller had a grand jury. He could use wiretaps. He could dip his hands into whatever the intelligence community had. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his investigators have a limited subpoena power, and they’re seen as political investigators. So it’s hard to think that if Mueller, in nearly two years of rummaging around Trump’s life, didn’t find it, that Nadler will.michael barbaroThank you, Michael.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroOn tomorrow’s “Daily,” a conversation with Representative Jerry Nadler.The DailySubscribe:Apple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsPart 2: What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report)We look at three possible outcomes of the special counsel investigation, which is believed to be wrapping up soon.Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett and Rachel Quester, and edited by Lisa TobinMore episodes ofThe DailyApril 16, 2019  •  28:05The Rise and Fall of Carlos GhosnApril 15, 2019  •  30:02The Moral Complexities of Working With Julian AssangeApril 12, 2019Israel’s Election, Through the Eyes of a Young PalestinianApril 11, 2019  •  28:40Netanyahu Won.

Many saw the sentence as a glaring example of the leniency that wealthy white-collar criminals often receive. Mr. Manafort’s sentencing and the congressional hearings of Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, have highlighted continued questions about how Mr. Trump might use his pardon power.The 81 document requests dispatched to Mr. Trump’s associates last week by the House Judiciary Committee detailed the breadth and ambition of Democrats’ new investigation.

This is “The Daily.” Today: As the special counsel finishes his investigation, he can pursue three different paths — each one with a profoundly different impact on how Congress will proceed. Why recent history makes one of those paths especially treacherous. Part 2 of what to expect from the Mueller report. It’s Monday, March 11. Mike Schmidt, you are arguably the best-sourced reporter in Washington. When is the Mueller report going to come out? And what is it going to say?michael schmidtI don’t know, and I don’t know.michael barbaro(LAUGHS) No, but seriously — best guess?michael schmidtBest guess — sometime in the next month or so. But I don’t want to be in a position saying that, because a lot of our colleagues at other places have tried to put an end date on an investigation.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtAnd that’s a very dangerous place to be as a reporter.michael barbaroYeah, I was just joking.michael schmidtI’m just — there’s no joking in special counsels. [MUSIC]michael barbaroO.K. So we know that the report will be coming out relatively soon. We don’t know precisely when — which is why, last week, we spoke to Neal Katyal, the guy who wrote the special counsel rules that have been guiding Robert Mueller. And he talked to us about the form and the size that this report would take. And I want to talk to you, Mike, about its actual contents and conclusions. What are those likely to be?michael schmidtSo the president is being investigated for whether he obstructed justice or has been a witting or unwitting agent of Russia. So there are three possibilities. The first possibility is that the report could say he broke the law — that he either obstructed justice or is indeed an agent of this foreign power.michael barbaroAnd if that’s the case — that Mueller recommends charging the president with a crime, which would be a very big deal — what would happen next?michael schmidtThe attorney general, Bill Barr, would have to decide whether to take the extraordinary decision of indicting the president or to follow Justice Department policy, which says that a president should not be indicted while they’re in office. It’s hard to imagine a scenario which Barr doesn’t follow the policy.michael barbaroWhich says do not indict the president.michael schmidtCorrect. If that’s what they conclude, they also believe that the only place to deal with wrongdoing by the president is Congress. So that information, that evidence against the president, needs to go to the House.michael barbaroO.K. So in that scenario, the special counsel makes the case that there’s sufficient evidence to charge the president, and yet the attorney general, because of a legal interpretation he has, will not want to bring such a charge against the president. And from our conversation with Neal Katyal, we know that that information — to charge or not to charge — will have to be laid out to Congress. And Congress will receive that information from the attorney general. So then what happens?michael schmidtThe Democrats in the House would take it, and they’d say, oh, my gosh. Bob Mueller wanted to indict the president. We are going to take this and begin impeachment proceedings. It’s hard to see Mueller saying the president broke the law and the Democrats saying, O.K., we’re going to take a pass here.michael barbaroEspecially if they feel that such a charge was impeded in your scenario by the attorney general.michael schmidtThere was a good little episode that occurred around this several weeks ago that I thought gave us great insight. BuzzFeed posted their story that said that the president had asked Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtBig deal, anonymously sourced — within an hour or two, members of the House, leading Democrats, are talking about impeachment. That was the reaction. Now, we know the BuzzFeed story becomes a whole different thing.michael barbaroComplicated, unproven.michael schmidtComplicated, et cetera, knocked down by Mueller — but you think if the House of Representatives, the Democrats there, are told by Mueller, I think the president broke the law, that they’re not going to move towards impeachment? If they were willing to move towards impeachment based on an anonymously based story, you think that with all the weight they had put into Mueller — they have held Mueller up in such high esteem for two years, done all these things to try and protect him — that they won’t move as quickly as possible in that direction? Look, we’re trying to predict the future here, which is difficult. But I don’t see it turning out a different way, at least at this point.michael barbaroO.K. So in this scenario with a report that says the president committed crimes, it would give the Democrats license to investigate everything that they have said that they want to investigate, even beyond the limited scope of the Mueller investigation — all seemingly in an effort to get to impeachment and the removal of the president from office.michael schmidtLook, the Democrats are going to investigate the president regardless of this. What a Mueller report saying the president broke the law would do is give the political wind directly at the back of the Democrats and push them hard in an impeachment direction, but also put pressure on Republicans. That’s the difference. It will push Republicans in a way that we haven’t seen before. And the other thing — Republicans have hung with the president throughout all of this. They have seen how he has behaved for the past two years, and they’ve said, we’re O.K. with this. So maybe they’ll continue there, but a strong Mueller report would be the greatest test of that that we’ve seen.michael barbaroSo that is the brightest possible green light for House Democrats to dig and dig and proceed with their investigations.michael schmidtCorrect. [MUSIC]michael barbaroO.K. That is the first possibility for how this proceeds. What is the second possibility, Mike?michael schmidtMueller says, I’ve investigated for nearly two years and have found no evidence that the president broke the law or that he’s an agent of a foreign power. And Mueller’s investigation could have found very unsavory political things about the president, but that doesn’t mean he broke the law. And we don’t have enough evidence to clear that high bar of proving that the president broke the law. And here are my findings.michael barbaroSo essentially not enough evidence to charge — no charges?michael schmidtBest outcome for the president.michael barbaroAnd what are the implications of that from Mueller for the Democrats in Congress?michael schmidtThat type of ending of the investigation would be very, very damaging to the ambitions of the Democrats to fully investigate the president and impeach him. It takes all the wind out of their sails, because here they are — have said, we will wait until we see Mueller’s report before moving forward with something like impeachment. We need to see what Mueller found. And O.K., here’s Mueller’s findings. He doesn’t have any evidence the president broke the law.

And here is our homework.archived recording (james comey)F.B.I. investigators also read all of the approximately 30,000 emails that Secretary Clinton provided to the State Department in 2014.michael schmidtThat a Justice Department, which is controlled by one political party or the other, needs to be more forthcoming about what they have found to make the argument to the average person that their decision has been based on the evidence and not political favor.archived recording (james comey)I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout the investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done honestly, competently and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation, including people in government, but none of that mattered to us.michael schmidtHe thinks a storm is coming from the Republicans who control Congress at the time. And he’s trying to inoculate the F.B.I. from that by saying, here’s what we found, here’s why we decided what we did — because he thought that he could use the facts of what they found as a shield to explain his decision.michael barbaroAnd how likely is Mueller to replicate that model?michael schmidtMy guess is highly unlikely.michael barbaroWhy?michael schmidtBecause Jim Comey has been blasted for what he did in that press conference and painted as someone who was using a criminal process to dirty up Clinton politically — that in this country, the Democrats would argue, you should not use a criminal process to undermine someone politically. And that’s what his press conference did.michael barbaroSo the conclusion was that it was an unnecessary, kind of gratuitous sullying of Hillary Clinton, even though there was no evidence she had committed a crime.michael schmidtCorrect. They’re saying if the F.B.I. investigated the average American and found that that person had not committed a crime, we don’t then stand up and say, hey, look at all the unsavory things they did — which we didn’t think rose to something they should be charged with.michael barbaroRight, because Comey could have just come out and said, we’re finished. There are no crimes. Thank you for coming. See you soon.michael schmidtCorrect. But Comey’s argument was if I had not done that, no one would have taken the decision seriously.michael barbaroSo you think that because of what Comey did and the reaction to it, Robert Mueller is very unlikely to make the same decision. He won’t employ the Comey hybrid, as you have deemed it, and instead we’ll probably get a pretty black-and-white Mueller report. It will either be crimes or no crimes — not some hybrid where the homework is shown.michael schmidtIf we’re sitting here trying to predict the future of an investigation we have little insight into, sure.michael barbaroO.K. [MUSIC] Mike, so far we have been talking almost exclusively about Mueller’s assessment of President Trump himself. But as we know, Mueller has been investigating the entire apparatus around the president, and he has already indicted dozens of people. So I wonder if in this final report, the biggest finding may not be about the president, but about the people close to him. For example, he could find that President Trump’s sons have committed some kind of crime — his lawyers, people who work at the Trump Organization.michael schmidtI’m not sure what that would change politically, though.michael barbaroTell me what you mean.michael schmidtThe president’s former national security advisor, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer have all been indicted — all people closely associated with him, closely associated with the campaign, closely associated with crimes. And that didn’t move Republicans politically on the president. So why would more drops in that puddle make a difference? Do you think there’s a tipping point? Is there a straw that you think that would break the Republicans’ back on this? I think that straw is evidence that the president broke the law. I don’t think it’s more evidence that others around the president broke the law.michael barbaroSo it really only matters whether Mueller recommends bringing charges against the president?michael schmidtIn my assessment, based on what we know, I think that makes the most sense.michael barbaroWhich is kind of fascinating, because we have been waiting 22 months, and what you’re kind of suggesting here is that, in the end, all these other indictments, all these other charges, all these other characters — those may end up being kind of irrelevant when it comes to the politics surrounding the future of this investigation if the president is not charged.michael schmidtWe already know so much. President’s personal lawyer has pled guilty twice in two separate investigations involving the president. President’s former campaign chairman has been charged two separate indictments.michael barbaroPaul Manafort.michael schmidtSo why would more of that be any different? I don’t think that’s the factor that drives this story forward in a different direction.michael barbaroBut isn’t there a world, Mike, where Democrats in Congress decide they don’t really care about the political winds. They don’t really care whether Republicans think their investigation is legitimate. They don’t really care what the public may think about the investigation. They put their heads down. They keep investigating. And because the scope of their investigation is much broader than that of Robert Mueller, they find something very significant, very damning, and it leads to a political process that could lead to impeachment.michael schmidtYeah. And they impeach him in the House, without the political backing of Mueller saying the president broke the law, and it goes to the Senate, and no Republicans come along. And it dies. And Donald Trump runs on, look at the witch hunt that impeached me in the House. And they couldn’t get it done in the Senate, and here I am running for re-election in 2020. They arm him with the ability to say, look at what they did to me. [MUSIC] And you have to remember that, of course, there’s stones out there that Mueller may not have looked under, but ultimately, Congress does not have the powers that Mueller had for his investigation. Mueller had a grand jury. He could use wiretaps. He could dip his hands into whatever the intelligence community had. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his investigators have a limited subpoena power, and they’re seen as political investigators. So it’s hard to think that if Mueller, in nearly two years of rummaging around Trump’s life, didn’t find it, that Nadler will.michael barbaroThank you, Michael.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroOn tomorrow’s “Daily,” a conversation with Representative Jerry Nadler.The DailySubscribe:Apple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsPart 2: What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report)We look at three possible outcomes of the special counsel investigation, which is believed to be wrapping up soon.Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett and Rachel Quester, and edited by Lisa TobinMore episodes ofThe DailyApril 16, 2019  •  28:05The Rise and Fall of Carlos GhosnApril 15, 2019  •  30:02The Moral Complexities of Working With Julian AssangeApril 12, 2019Israel’s Election, Through the Eyes of a Young PalestinianApril 11, 2019  •  28:40Netanyahu Won.

And then — shortly after 5 p.m. — they finally had something headline worthy.That was when the major networks and cable news outlets reported that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had completed the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and had submitted his report to Attorney General William P. Barr.On CNN, Wolf Blitzer read aloud from a copy of Mr. Barr’s letter to Congress. On CBS, the anchor Jeff Glor broke into the network’s analysis of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament.On Fox News, the highest-rated cable news station, the anchor Juan Williams reported the big story during the daily episode of “The Five.” “We’ve just been told that the Mueller report has been delivered to the Justice Department,” he said at 5:03.Not long after those words were out of his mouth, the speculation started anew. The “Five” member Jesse Watters seemed to undercut the import of the breaking story, saying, “I honestly don’t think the rest of the country, outside the swamp and the Mueller partisans, cares about the Mueller report.”After mentioning a few things that, in his view, typical citizens actually do care about, like Netflix and college basketball, Mr. Watters added, “If there was real collusion, it would have leaked by now.”Another “Five” panelist, Dana Perino, offered commentary that was less charged. “Setting aside what it says or doesn’t say about how Russia tried to get involved, I think this report could actually be quite instructive about what we need to do to protect our elections going forward,” she said.On this day that so many had been waiting for, Mr. Mueller stayed out of the media glare. He had issued no public comments while conducting the investigation, and even when it was all wrapped up, he did not face the cameras. All the while, through the 22 months of his inquiry, he managed to drive countless hours of onscreen discussion without setting foot in a television studio.The news of his report followed a day of low-calorie cable fare, heavy on anticipation and light on facts, that teased the development the networks were counting on.“It’s Friday, but is it Mueller Friday?” the CNN anchor John King sked at the start of his noon-hour show, “Inside Politics.” Around the same time, the CNN reporter Laura Jarrett noted on Twitter that Justice Department reporters at the network had hunkered down: “Breaking — DOJ beat reporters ordering pizza,” she wrote.What seemed like a relatively slow news days decelerated further when Fox News took a moment to declare that the 94-year-old Jimmy Carter had become the oldest former living United States president in history, surpassing the first President George Bush.Then, at last, came the news that the special counsel’s work was done.After all the buildup, the anchors had one new development to gnaw on: the fact that, according to a Justice Department official, the Mueller report recommended no new charges. (Before the report was submitted, the special counsel had filed 199 charges against 34 people and three companies.)On NBC, after the main news had hit, the veteran Justice Department reporter Pete Williams reported that “there will be no more indictments from the special counsel.” Others seemed reluctant to go there, at least at first. “Nobody knows anything,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough cautioned on Twitter.

Mueller III, and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associates. [Read about the special counsel’s full report that was delivered to the attorney general on Friday. ]We asked readers what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next. We received more than 600 questions, and our journalists in Washington responded to a selection.It’s quite simple: What will the public get to see, and when will that happen?Ben Nieves, Portland, Ore.It all depends on Attorney General William Barr. He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigators’ findings should be made public. Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he wants to release as much as he can. On Friday, he told Congress he could provide lawmakers with an update on Mr. Mueller’s findings as soon as this weekend. But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress, as the special counsel’s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury.— Michael S. SchmidtImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, received the special counsel’s report from Robert S. Mueller on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDoes Barr have sole discretion on what will be released and what will be suppressed?Callie Maister, TorontoMr. Barr has broad discretion, but it is not absolute. He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules absent a court’s permission, for example. He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain materials, like communications with the president or agency deliberations. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said he intended to be as transparent as possible, consistent with the Justice Department’s practices and policies. That could mean withholding information about open investigations or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime. There is also a wild card: Mr. Barr has long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president, as head of the executive branch, has a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such as himself.— Charlie SavageOn what grounds could William Barr decline to release information from Mr. Mueller’s report?PJ Abraham, CaliforniaMr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rules. He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigations. There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claims is subject to “executive privilege,” which protects confidential discussions between the president and his advisers.— Mark MazzettiAre additional indictments from Mr. Mueller’s office (as opposed to from the Southern District of New York or other districts) possible or even likely?Bruce Mastron, Gainesville, Fla.The investigation by the special counsel’s office is over now that Mr. Mueller has provided his final report to the attorney general. So his team is not expected to seek additional charges. Other federal prosecutors who received information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation could move forward and seek indictments. For instance, federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate possible crimes that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violations that ensnared Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer. Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration. Mr. Mueller had referred both cases to other prosecutors.— Adam GoldmanImagePresident Trump departed the White House on Friday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesWhy can’t a sitting president be indicted?Michelle Milligan, San FranciscoNothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration, and again under the Clinton administration — has opined that “structural principles” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president. Essentially, the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duties, so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal, or because his term is up. This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutors, including Mr. Mueller.— Charlie SavageWhat happens to all the collected evidence? Does the law require that it be archived, even if not public, or can it be destroyed?James Palmer, Burlington, Vt.There have already been referrals that Mr. Mueller has made to federal prosecutors when he has found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview. The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began as a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation. A number of House committee chairmen are planning to ask executive branch agencies to preserve documents that they provided to the special counsel.— Maggie HabermanWhat would the worst-case scenario version of the report look like for Trump? What conclusions would it reach, and why would those be bad for Trump?Dakota Gardner, BrooklynWe don’t know what’s in the report. I don’t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be. But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s investigation led to charges against more than 30 people, but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy.— Adam GoldmanWhy was Trump not interviewed? What effect will this have on the investigation?Beth Long, Knoxville, Tenn.We really don’t know the answer, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers consider it one of their greatest accomplishments that he never sat for an interview. In early 2018, Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president, setting off months of negotiations between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Ultimately, in November, Mr. Trump answered several questions in writing about what occurred during the campaign. But he refused to answer questions about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice. This meant that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were only left with the statements of other witnesses when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believed heading off an interview was such a great success because if he had testified, he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure.— Michael S. SchmidtImagePeople took pictures outside of the Department of Justice.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesI would love to know what is next for Robert Mueller now that the report is complete.Philip Goodwin, Moraga, Calif.Good question, we don’t know. Disney World?We do know that some members of his team intend to return to their jobs at law firms in New York and Washington, and others to return to the Justice Department. It has been reported that Andrew Weissmann, one of the senior members of the team, intends to teach at New York University. As for Mr. Mueller, maybe he’ll also go back to working at a law firm or retire. It’s certainly possible that one or more of the House committees investigating various aspects of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify, though Mr. Barr, the attorney general, will have a say in whether he can do so.— Mark MazzettiWhat could possibly be in the report that isn’t appropriate for anyone to see? Why can’t specifics (like names) be redacted and the gist of what was found be released? Is it anything other than Trump damage control?Peter Sherno, MinneapolisIn his letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.” But we don’t know what is in the underlying report. Here are some categories of elements that may raise legal or policy concerns about disclosure to Congress or the public:1. Any highly classified information, such as something that could help the Russian government identify and take out an intelligence source;2. Anything that remains relevant to an ongoing investigation, such as those that Mr. Mueller spun off to regular prosecutors or the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into Russia;3. Testimony and files that were presented to the grand jury and so are subject to a federal rule of criminal procedure that generally forbids disclosure of such material absent a court order;4. Negative information about people whom prosecutors scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime, which the Justice Department normally does not make public (this is why Mr. Comey’s news conference about Hillary Clinton’s email server was so broadly condemned by other law enforcement officials);5. Internal executive branch information, like confidential communications with the president or agency deliberations, that could be subject to a claim of executive privilege.— Charlie SavageCan Congress subpoena the report?Eric M., New YorkIn short, yes. Congress can subpoena just about anything it wants, but that does not mean lawmakers will do so or that they will be successful in getting what they want. Democrats have made abundantly clear that they will be satisfied with nothing less than Mr. Mueller’s full report and access to his underlying evidence. They will start by asking for the Justice Department to share all that information voluntarily. If the department resists, a committee could issue a subpoena to try to compel it to produce the relevant documents. What comes next is likely complicated. There are several reasons the Justice Department might be unwilling to just hand over classified or grand jury information, even under subpoena. In that case, Congress could sue to try to enforce its demand. Then it would be up to the courts to decide who gets to see what.— Nicholas FandosImageMr. Barr informed Congress on Friday that Mr. Mueller’s investigation concluded.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesDo the president and the White House get to read the Mueller report and provide their feedback to William Barr before Barr releases his report to Congress?Allen Samelson, Berkeley, Calif.The White House counsel’s office anticipates being able to review the report to raise possible objections related to executive privilege. We have no sense right now how long that will take, but any effort by the White House to bar the release of elements of the report is sure to set off a political and legal battle.Mr. Barr said on Friday that he anticipates being able to brief Congress within a few days about the special counsel’s “principal conclusions.” But it is not clear how much of the report’s details and underlying documentation he will ultimately provide to Congress and, by extension, the public. Mr. Barr appeared to be lowering expectations during his Senate confirmation hearings when he said he wanted to be as transparent as possible but might provide simply a summary to Congress.— Maggie HabermanHow much of the report will be available to state and federal prosecutors in other jurisdictions without requiring approval from Justice Department appointees?Theo Chism, Santa Barbara, Calif.We have no information that the full report will be made available to state or federal prosecutors. But during the course of his investigation, Mr. Mueller has referred a number of cases to other federal prosecutors in New York and Washington.— Adam GoldmanWhy does this really matter? If Trump’s base and the Republican Party stick with him through thick and thin (as they have on the majority of issues in the first two years of Trump’s presidency), then how important really is this report?Emma Strenski, IndianapolisWe still don’t know what’s in the report. In terms of electoral politics, you’re right — it might not fundamentally change the partisan divide over Mr. Trump. His supporters have shown a willingness to stay with him in the face of allegations and behavior that might have doomed a more traditional politician.But you could argue that this report has an importance that goes well beyond partisan politics, reflecting an investigation that yielded substantial results — not least in establishing the degree of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Don’t forget that half a dozen Trump aides have been indicted or convicted. Regardless of Mr. Mueller’s conclusions, Democrats in the House are pressing ahead on issues such as whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice after becoming president. The Democrats say Mr. Barr needs to make as much of Mr. Mueller’s findings public as soon as possible because the American people deserve an accounting of what went on.— Michael S. SchmidtCan you explain Mueller “not recommending any new charges be filed”? Does this mean Trump and his family are in the clear, or could there be something in the report to implicate them for other, perhaps bigger, things?Krista Burns, OhioIf anyone is to be indicted down the road, it won’t be by Mr. Mueller. It’s now clear that his team won’t try to charge anyone else, because his work is done. To be sure, there are now numerous, ongoing investigations by other federal prosecutors that could mean legal peril for Mr. Trump’s advisers or family members. Remember that in the investigation being run by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cohen implicated the president in a scheme to pay off two women before the 2016 election. But given Justice Department rules, there isn’t any expectation that Mr. Trump would be in legal jeopardy as long as he’s in the White House.— Mark MazzettiHow much did the Mueller report cost?Steve Satterwhite, Duncanville, Tex.As of Sept. 30, 2018, the special counsel’s investigation had cost more than $25 million. More than $12 million of that was direct spending by Mr. Mueller’s team. That amount will increase once the special counsel’s office submits its final list of expenses. Those costs included the expenses of Justice Department personnel and other resources that supported the special counsel office. The special counsel says the Justice Department would have incurred those expenses for the “investigations irrespective of the existence of the (special counsel office).” The special counsel also seized more millions in property and fines.— Adam GoldmanHow long — as in, how many pages — can we expect the report be?James Underwood, Columbus, OhioWe wish we knew. Keep in mind there are likely to be two reports: one prepared by Mr. Mueller for the Justice Department and another prepared by Mr. Barr to be shared with Congress and the public. Both reports could be as short as a few pages, or considerably longer. And Mr. Barr could well choose to give the public a more concise report than Mr. Mueller gave him.

Mueller III, and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associates. [Read about the special counsel’s full report that was delivered to the attorney general on Friday. ]We asked readers what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next. We received more than 600 questions, and our journalists in Washington responded to a selection.It’s quite simple: What will the public get to see, and when will that happen?Ben Nieves, Portland, Ore.It all depends on Attorney General William Barr. He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigators’ findings should be made public. Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he wants to release as much as he can. On Friday, he told Congress he could provide lawmakers with an update on Mr. Mueller’s findings as soon as this weekend. But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress, as the special counsel’s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury.— Michael S. SchmidtImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, received the special counsel’s report from Robert S. Mueller on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDoes Barr have sole discretion on what will be released and what will be suppressed?Callie Maister, TorontoMr. Barr has broad discretion, but it is not absolute. He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules absent a court’s permission, for example. He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain materials, like communications with the president or agency deliberations. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said he intended to be as transparent as possible, consistent with the Justice Department’s practices and policies. That could mean withholding information about open investigations or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime. There is also a wild card: Mr. Barr has long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president, as head of the executive branch, has a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such as himself.— Charlie SavageOn what grounds could William Barr decline to release information from Mr. Mueller’s report?PJ Abraham, CaliforniaMr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rules. He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigations. There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claims is subject to “executive privilege,” which protects confidential discussions between the president and his advisers.— Mark MazzettiAre additional indictments from Mr. Mueller’s office (as opposed to from the Southern District of New York or other districts) possible or even likely?Bruce Mastron, Gainesville, Fla.The investigation by the special counsel’s office is over now that Mr. Mueller has provided his final report to the attorney general. So his team is not expected to seek additional charges. Other federal prosecutors who received information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation could move forward and seek indictments. For instance, federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate possible crimes that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violations that ensnared Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer. Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration. Mr. Mueller had referred both cases to other prosecutors.— Adam GoldmanImagePresident Trump departed the White House on Friday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesWhy can’t a sitting president be indicted?Michelle Milligan, San FranciscoNothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration, and again under the Clinton administration — has opined that “structural principles” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president. Essentially, the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duties, so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal, or because his term is up. This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutors, including Mr. Mueller.— Charlie SavageWhat happens to all the collected evidence? Does the law require that it be archived, even if not public, or can it be destroyed?James Palmer, Burlington, Vt.There have already been referrals that Mr. Mueller has made to federal prosecutors when he has found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview. The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began as a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation. A number of House committee chairmen are planning to ask executive branch agencies to preserve documents that they provided to the special counsel.— Maggie HabermanWhat would the worst-case scenario version of the report look like for Trump? What conclusions would it reach, and why would those be bad for Trump?Dakota Gardner, BrooklynWe don’t know what’s in the report. I don’t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be. But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s investigation led to charges against more than 30 people, but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy.— Adam GoldmanWhy was Trump not interviewed? What effect will this have on the investigation?Beth Long, Knoxville, Tenn.We really don’t know the answer, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers consider it one of their greatest accomplishments that he never sat for an interview. In early 2018, Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president, setting off months of negotiations between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Ultimately, in November, Mr. Trump answered several questions in writing about what occurred during the campaign. But he refused to answer questions about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice. This meant that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were only left with the statements of other witnesses when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believed heading off an interview was such a great success because if he had testified, he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure.— Michael S. SchmidtImagePeople took pictures outside of the Department of Justice.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesI would love to know what is next for Robert Mueller now that the report is complete.Philip Goodwin, Moraga, Calif.Good question, we don’t know. Disney World?We do know that some members of his team intend to return to their jobs at law firms in New York and Washington, and others to return to the Justice Department. It has been reported that Andrew Weissmann, one of the senior members of the team, intends to teach at New York University. As for Mr. Mueller, maybe he’ll also go back to working at a law firm or retire. It’s certainly possible that one or more of the House committees investigating various aspects of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify, though Mr. Barr, the attorney general, will have a say in whether he can do so.— Mark MazzettiWhat could possibly be in the report that isn’t appropriate for anyone to see?

It’s certainly possible that one or more of the House committees investigating various aspects of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify, though Mr. Barr, the attorney general, will have a say in whether he can do so.— Mark MazzettiWhat could possibly be in the report that isn’t appropriate for anyone to see? Why can’t specifics (like names) be redacted and the gist of what was found be released? Is it anything other than Trump damage control?Peter Sherno, MinneapolisIn his letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.” But we don’t know what is in the underlying report. Here are some categories of elements that may raise legal or policy concerns about disclosure to Congress or the public:1. Any highly classified information, such as something that could help the Russian government identify and take out an intelligence source;2. Anything that remains relevant to an ongoing investigation, such as those that Mr. Mueller spun off to regular prosecutors or the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into Russia;3. Testimony and files that were presented to the grand jury and so are subject to a federal rule of criminal procedure that generally forbids disclosure of such material absent a court order;4. Negative information about people whom prosecutors scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime, which the Justice Department normally does not make public (this is why Mr. Comey’s news conference about Hillary Clinton’s email server was so broadly condemned by other law enforcement officials);5. Internal executive branch information, like confidential communications with the president or agency deliberations, that could be subject to a claim of executive privilege.— Charlie SavageCan Congress subpoena the report?Eric M., New YorkIn short, yes. Congress can subpoena just about anything it wants, but that does not mean lawmakers will do so or that they will be successful in getting what they want. Democrats have made abundantly clear that they will be satisfied with nothing less than Mr. Mueller’s full report and access to his underlying evidence. They will start by asking for the Justice Department to share all that information voluntarily. If the department resists, a committee could issue a subpoena to try to compel it to produce the relevant documents. What comes next is likely complicated. There are several reasons the Justice Department might be unwilling to just hand over classified or grand jury information, even under subpoena. In that case, Congress could sue to try to enforce its demand. Then it would be up to the courts to decide who gets to see what.— Nicholas FandosImageMr. Barr informed Congress on Friday that Mr. Mueller’s investigation concluded.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesDo the president and the White House get to read the Mueller report and provide their feedback to William Barr before Barr releases his report to Congress?Allen Samelson, Berkeley, Calif.The White House counsel’s office anticipates being able to review the report to raise possible objections related to executive privilege. We have no sense right now how long that will take, but any effort by the White House to bar the release of elements of the report is sure to set off a political and legal battle.Mr. Barr said on Friday that he anticipates being able to brief Congress within a few days about the special counsel’s “principal conclusions.” But it is not clear how much of the report’s details and underlying documentation he will ultimately provide to Congress and, by extension, the public. Mr. Barr appeared to be lowering expectations during his Senate confirmation hearings when he said he wanted to be as transparent as possible but might provide simply a summary to Congress.— Maggie HabermanHow much of the report will be available to state and federal prosecutors in other jurisdictions without requiring approval from Justice Department appointees?Theo Chism, Santa Barbara, Calif.We have no information that the full report will be made available to state or federal prosecutors. But during the course of his investigation, Mr. Mueller has referred a number of cases to other federal prosecutors in New York and Washington.— Adam GoldmanWhy does this really matter? If Trump’s base and the Republican Party stick with him through thick and thin (as they have on the majority of issues in the first two years of Trump’s presidency), then how important really is this report?Emma Strenski, IndianapolisWe still don’t know what’s in the report. In terms of electoral politics, you’re right — it might not fundamentally change the partisan divide over Mr. Trump. His supporters have shown a willingness to stay with him in the face of allegations and behavior that might have doomed a more traditional politician.But you could argue that this report has an importance that goes well beyond partisan politics, reflecting an investigation that yielded substantial results — not least in establishing the degree of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Don’t forget that half a dozen Trump aides have been indicted or convicted. Regardless of Mr. Mueller’s conclusions, Democrats in the House are pressing ahead on issues such as whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice after becoming president. The Democrats say Mr. Barr needs to make as much of Mr. Mueller’s findings public as soon as possible because the American people deserve an accounting of what went on.— Michael S. SchmidtCan you explain Mueller “not recommending any new charges be filed”? Does this mean Trump and his family are in the clear, or could there be something in the report to implicate them for other, perhaps bigger, things?Krista Burns, OhioIf anyone is to be indicted down the road, it won’t be by Mr. Mueller. It’s now clear that his team won’t try to charge anyone else, because his work is done. To be sure, there are now numerous, ongoing investigations by other federal prosecutors that could mean legal peril for Mr. Trump’s advisers or family members. Remember that in the investigation being run by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cohen implicated the president in a scheme to pay off two women before the 2016 election. But given Justice Department rules, there isn’t any expectation that Mr. Trump would be in legal jeopardy as long as he’s in the White House.— Mark MazzettiHow much did the Mueller report cost?Steve Satterwhite, Duncanville, Tex.As of Sept. 30, 2018, the special counsel’s investigation had cost more than $25 million. More than $12 million of that was direct spending by Mr. Mueller’s team. That amount will increase once the special counsel’s office submits its final list of expenses. Those costs included the expenses of Justice Department personnel and other resources that supported the special counsel office. The special counsel says the Justice Department would have incurred those expenses for the “investigations irrespective of the existence of the (special counsel office).” The special counsel also seized more millions in property and fines.— Adam GoldmanHow long — as in, how many pages — can we expect the report be?James Underwood, Columbus, OhioWe wish we knew. Keep in mind there are likely to be two reports: one prepared by Mr. Mueller for the Justice Department and another prepared by Mr. Barr to be shared with Congress and the public. Both reports could be as short as a few pages, or considerably longer. And Mr. Barr could well choose to give the public a more concise report than Mr. Mueller gave him.

Mueller III, and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associates. [Read about the special counsel’s full report that was delivered to the attorney general on Friday. ]We asked readers what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next. We received more than 600 questions, and our journalists in Washington responded to a selection.It’s quite simple: What will the public get to see, and when will that happen?Ben Nieves, Portland, Ore.It all depends on Attorney General William Barr. He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigators’ findings should be made public. Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he wants to release as much as he can. On Friday, he told Congress he could provide lawmakers with an update on Mr. Mueller’s findings as soon as this weekend. But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress, as the special counsel’s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury.— Michael S. SchmidtImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, received the special counsel’s report from Robert S. Mueller on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDoes Barr have sole discretion on what will be released and what will be suppressed?Callie Maister, TorontoMr. Barr has broad discretion, but it is not absolute. He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules absent a court’s permission, for example. He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain materials, like communications with the president or agency deliberations. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said he intended to be as transparent as possible, consistent with the Justice Department’s practices and policies. That could mean withholding information about open investigations or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime. There is also a wild card: Mr. Barr has long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president, as head of the executive branch, has a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such as himself.— Charlie SavageOn what grounds could William Barr decline to release information from Mr. Mueller’s report?PJ Abraham, CaliforniaMr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rules. He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigations. There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claims is subject to “executive privilege,” which protects confidential discussions between the president and his advisers.— Mark MazzettiAre additional indictments from Mr. Mueller’s office (as opposed to from the Southern District of New York or other districts) possible or even likely?Bruce Mastron, Gainesville, Fla.The investigation by the special counsel’s office is over now that Mr. Mueller has provided his final report to the attorney general. So his team is not expected to seek additional charges. Other federal prosecutors who received information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation could move forward and seek indictments. For instance, federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate possible crimes that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violations that ensnared Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer. Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration. Mr. Mueller had referred both cases to other prosecutors.— Adam GoldmanImagePresident Trump departed the White House on Friday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesWhy can’t a sitting president be indicted?Michelle Milligan, San FranciscoNothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration, and again under the Clinton administration — has opined that “structural principles” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president. Essentially, the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duties, so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal, or because his term is up. This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutors, including Mr. Mueller.— Charlie SavageWhat happens to all the collected evidence? Does the law require that it be archived, even if not public, or can it be destroyed?James Palmer, Burlington, Vt.There have already been referrals that Mr. Mueller has made to federal prosecutors when he has found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview. The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began as a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation. A number of House committee chairmen are planning to ask executive branch agencies to preserve documents that they provided to the special counsel.— Maggie HabermanWhat would the worst-case scenario version of the report look like for Trump? What conclusions would it reach, and why would those be bad for Trump?Dakota Gardner, BrooklynWe don’t know what’s in the report. I don’t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be. But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s investigation led to charges against more than 30 people, but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy.— Adam GoldmanWhy was Trump not interviewed? What effect will this have on the investigation?Beth Long, Knoxville, Tenn.We really don’t know the answer, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers consider it one of their greatest accomplishments that he never sat for an interview. In early 2018, Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president, setting off months of negotiations between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Ultimately, in November, Mr. Trump answered several questions in writing about what occurred during the campaign. But he refused to answer questions about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice. This meant that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were only left with the statements of other witnesses when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believed heading off an interview was such a great success because if he had testified, he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure.— Michael S.

As for Mr. Mueller, maybe he’ll also go back to working at a law firm or retire. It’s certainly possible that one or more of the House committees investigating various aspects of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify, though Mr. Barr, the attorney general, will have a say in whether he can do so.— Mark MazzettiWhat could possibly be in the report that isn’t appropriate for anyone to see? Why can’t specifics (like names) be redacted and the gist of what was found be released? Is it anything other than Trump damage control?Peter Sherno, MinneapolisIn his letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.” But we don’t know what is in the underlying report. Here are some categories of elements that may raise legal or policy concerns about disclosure to Congress or the public:1. Any highly classified information, such as something that could help the Russian government identify and take out an intelligence source;2. Anything that remains relevant to an ongoing investigation, such as those that Mr. Mueller spun off to regular prosecutors or the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into Russia;3. Testimony and files that were presented to the grand jury and so are subject to a federal rule of criminal procedure that generally forbids disclosure of such material absent a court order;4. Negative information about people whom prosecutors scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime, which the Justice Department normally does not make public (this is why Mr. Comey’s news conference about Hillary Clinton’s email server was so broadly condemned by other law enforcement officials);5. Internal executive branch information, like confidential communications with the president or agency deliberations, that could be subject to a claim of executive privilege.— Charlie SavageCan Congress subpoena the report?Eric M., New YorkIn short, yes. Congress can subpoena just about anything it wants, but that does not mean lawmakers will do so or that they will be successful in getting what they want. Democrats have made abundantly clear that they will be satisfied with nothing less than Mr. Mueller’s full report and access to his underlying evidence. They will start by asking for the Justice Department to share all that information voluntarily. If the department resists, a committee could issue a subpoena to try to compel it to produce the relevant documents. What comes next is likely complicated. There are several reasons the Justice Department might be unwilling to just hand over classified or grand jury information, even under subpoena. In that case, Congress could sue to try to enforce its demand. Then it would be up to the courts to decide who gets to see what.— Nicholas FandosImageMr. Barr informed Congress on Friday that Mr. Mueller’s investigation concluded.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesDo the president and the White House get to read the Mueller report and provide their feedback to William Barr before Barr releases his report to Congress?Allen Samelson, Berkeley, Calif.The White House counsel’s office anticipates being able to review the report to raise possible objections related to executive privilege. We have no sense right now how long that will take, but any effort by the White House to bar the release of elements of the report is sure to set off a political and legal battle.Mr. Barr said on Friday that he anticipates being able to brief Congress within a few days about the special counsel’s “principal conclusions.” But it is not clear how much of the report’s details and underlying documentation he will ultimately provide to Congress and, by extension, the public. Mr. Barr appeared to be lowering expectations during his Senate confirmation hearings when he said he wanted to be as transparent as possible but might provide simply a summary to Congress.— Maggie HabermanHow much of the report will be available to state and federal prosecutors in other jurisdictions without requiring approval from Justice Department appointees?Theo Chism, Santa Barbara, Calif.We have no information that the full report will be made available to state or federal prosecutors. But during the course of his investigation, Mr. Mueller has referred a number of cases to other federal prosecutors in New York and Washington.— Adam GoldmanWhy does this really matter? If Trump’s base and the Republican Party stick with him through thick and thin (as they have on the majority of issues in the first two years of Trump’s presidency), then how important really is this report?Emma Strenski, IndianapolisWe still don’t know what’s in the report. In terms of electoral politics, you’re right — it might not fundamentally change the partisan divide over Mr. Trump. His supporters have shown a willingness to stay with him in the face of allegations and behavior that might have doomed a more traditional politician.But you could argue that this report has an importance that goes well beyond partisan politics, reflecting an investigation that yielded substantial results — not least in establishing the degree of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Don’t forget that half a dozen Trump aides have been indicted or convicted. Regardless of Mr. Mueller’s conclusions, Democrats in the House are pressing ahead on issues such as whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice after becoming president. The Democrats say Mr. Barr needs to make as much of Mr. Mueller’s findings public as soon as possible because the American people deserve an accounting of what went on.— Michael S. SchmidtCan you explain Mueller “not recommending any new charges be filed”? Does this mean Trump and his family are in the clear, or could there be something in the report to implicate them for other, perhaps bigger, things?Krista Burns, OhioIf anyone is to be indicted down the road, it won’t be by Mr. Mueller. It’s now clear that his team won’t try to charge anyone else, because his work is done. To be sure, there are now numerous, ongoing investigations by other federal prosecutors that could mean legal peril for Mr. Trump’s advisers or family members. Remember that in the investigation being run by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cohen implicated the president in a scheme to pay off two women before the 2016 election. But given Justice Department rules, there isn’t any expectation that Mr. Trump would be in legal jeopardy as long as he’s in the White House.— Mark MazzettiHow much did the Mueller report cost?Steve Satterwhite, Duncanville, Tex.As of Sept. 30, 2018, the special counsel’s investigation had cost more than $25 million. More than $12 million of that was direct spending by Mr. Mueller’s team. That amount will increase once the special counsel’s office submits its final list of expenses. Those costs included the expenses of Justice Department personnel and other resources that supported the special counsel office. The special counsel says the Justice Department would have incurred those expenses for the “investigations irrespective of the existence of the (special counsel office).” The special counsel also seized more millions in property and fines.— Adam GoldmanHow long — as in, how many pages — can we expect the report be?James Underwood, Columbus, OhioWe wish we knew. Keep in mind there are likely to be two reports: one prepared by Mr. Mueller for the Justice Department and another prepared by Mr. Barr to be shared with Congress and the public. Both reports could be as short as a few pages, or considerably longer. And Mr. Barr could well choose to give the public a more concise report than Mr. Mueller gave him.

Mueller III, and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associates. [Read about the special counsel’s full report that was delivered to the attorney general on Friday. ]We asked readers what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next. We received more than 600 questions, and our journalists in Washington responded to a selection.It’s quite simple: What will the public get to see, and when will that happen?Ben Nieves, Portland, Ore.It all depends on Attorney General William Barr. He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigators’ findings should be made public. Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he wants to release as much as he can. On Friday, he told Congress he could provide lawmakers with an update on Mr. Mueller’s findings as soon as this weekend. But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress, as the special counsel’s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury.— Michael S. SchmidtImageWilliam P. Barr, the attorney general, received the special counsel’s report from Robert S. Mueller on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDoes Barr have sole discretion on what will be released and what will be suppressed?Callie Maister, TorontoMr. Barr has broad discretion, but it is not absolute. He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules absent a court’s permission, for example. He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain materials, like communications with the president or agency deliberations. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said he intended to be as transparent as possible, consistent with the Justice Department’s practices and policies. That could mean withholding information about open investigations or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime. There is also a wild card: Mr. Barr has long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president, as head of the executive branch, has a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such as himself.— Charlie SavageOn what grounds could William Barr decline to release information from Mr. Mueller’s report?PJ Abraham, CaliforniaMr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rules. He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigations. There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claims is subject to “executive privilege,” which protects confidential discussions between the president and his advisers.— Mark MazzettiAre additional indictments from Mr. Mueller’s office (as opposed to from the Southern District of New York or other districts) possible or even likely?Bruce Mastron, Gainesville, Fla.The investigation by the special counsel’s office is over now that Mr. Mueller has provided his final report to the attorney general. So his team is not expected to seek additional charges. Other federal prosecutors who received information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation could move forward and seek indictments. For instance, federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate possible crimes that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violations that ensnared Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer. Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration. Mr. Mueller had referred both cases to other prosecutors.— Adam GoldmanImagePresident Trump departed the White House on Friday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesWhy can’t a sitting president be indicted?Michelle Milligan, San FranciscoNothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration, and again under the Clinton administration — has opined that “structural principles” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president. Essentially, the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duties, so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal, or because his term is up. This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutors, including Mr. Mueller.— Charlie SavageWhat happens to all the collected evidence? Does the law require that it be archived, even if not public, or can it be destroyed?James Palmer, Burlington, Vt.There have already been referrals that Mr. Mueller has made to federal prosecutors when he has found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview. The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began as a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation. A number of House committee chairmen are planning to ask executive branch agencies to preserve documents that they provided to the special counsel.— Maggie HabermanWhat would the worst-case scenario version of the report look like for Trump? What conclusions would it reach, and why would those be bad for Trump?Dakota Gardner, BrooklynWe don’t know what’s in the report. I don’t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be. But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s investigation led to charges against more than 30 people, but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy.— Adam GoldmanWhy was Trump not interviewed? What effect will this have on the investigation?Beth Long, Knoxville, Tenn.We really don’t know the answer, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers consider it one of their greatest accomplishments that he never sat for an interview. In early 2018, Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president, setting off months of negotiations between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Ultimately, in November, Mr. Trump answered several questions in writing about what occurred during the campaign. But he refused to answer questions about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice. This meant that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were only left with the statements of other witnesses when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believed heading off an interview was such a great success because if he had testified, he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure.— Michael S.

Barr has said he wants to be as transparent as possible but also that he will act consistently with the Justice Department’s regulations for special counsels.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The makings of an epic constitutional battle over the executive branch’s power to keep information secret from Congress started to take shape on Friday, as Attorney General William P. Barr began to weigh how much to disclose about the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.As Mr. Barr officially informed Congress that Mr. Mueller had handed in his long-awaited report about the Trump-Russia investigation to the Justice Department, Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately reiterated their demands to see the entire document — and more.Democrats have made clear they are also determined to gain access to the Mueller team’s supporting evidence and other investigative files, virtually guaranteeing a fight.“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the attorney general, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.In a letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he might release Mr. Mueller’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend. He is expected to take a longer time to review the broader report for information that is classified, subject to grand-jury secrecy rules or relevant to any open investigation before deciding what to show to Congress.Mr. Barr also plans to consult with the White House about any confidential internal information, including private conversations of the president, that is potentially subject to executive privilege. Decisions about what to make public will be even more complicated.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe House voted unanimously this month for a nonbinding resolution demanding that lawmakers be permitted to read the entire report and that the public be allowed to see as much as the law allows — even though the Justice Department’s special counsel regulations, written by the Clinton administration after Ken Starr’s investigation into the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals, do not call for that. They also do not prohibit it.Asked about the report in recent days, President Trump said he wanted Mr. Barr to “let people see it.”Regardless of how much of the report is eventually disclosed, Democrats are also pushing for information and material Mr. Mueller gathered but did not put in the report. Such files could include documents and records of interviews with witnesses, as well as any internal memos the Mueller team wrote analyzing negative information about people whom it ultimately decided against indicting.The Justice Department traditionally opposes turning over such files — especially if they contain information relevant to investigations that remain open. Mr. Mueller has handed off many cases his office developed to regular Justice Department prosecutors for continued pursuit, and there remains a permanently open counterintelligence investigation into Russia.“We’re definitely on a collision course for a major fight at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue over both the Mueller report, testimony related to it and the underlying case files,” said Andrew Wright, who specialized in executive privilege matters as a White House lawyer in the Obama administration and was a congressional oversight staff member.Such a fight would play out politically — with accusations by Democrats of a cover-up and by Republicans of legislative overreach — and legally. Democrats would begin with a House subpoena to Mr. Barr, followed by a vote to hold him in contempt over whatever he does not turn over.The House would then file a lawsuit to enforce its subpoena, asking a court to order Mr. Barr to comply with it. That would require the judge to decide whether Mr. Barr had a lawful basis to disregard the subpoena, including whether any invocation of executive privilege by Mr. Trump was legitimate.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Anticipating a lengthy fight, Democrats have already moved to gain access another way to some of the information Mr. Mueller gathered: by asking his witnesses who provided materials to him to give them copies of the same records. Swiftly recreating as much of Mr. Mueller’s files as possible was a key strategy behind letters the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, sent to 81 people and organizations this month asking for records.The committee so far has received tens of thousands of pages, but the most sensitive information gathered is available only from Mr. Mueller, leaving plenty to fight over.The top Democrats on six House committees issued a joint statement on Friday night calling on the Justice Department not only to release to the public “the entire report,” but also to give their panels “the underlying evidence uncovered during the course of the special counsel’s investigation” upon request.One potential obstacle will be information that is classified, like material that could reveal a secret source of intelligence about the Russian government. The executive branch traditionally limits highly sensitive information to the intelligence committees or even just the top “Gang of Eight” congressional leaders.Another potential hurdle will be information that Mr. Mueller used a grand jury to gather, such as records and testimony he obtained by subpoena. Federal rules of criminal procedure generally bar disclosure of such materials to outsiders — a limit that, on its face, makes no exception for Congress.Still, a judge could issue an order permitting grand jury information to be shared with Congress, as happened in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. A key question would be whether the Trump administration consents to such a request — as the Nixon administration did — or fights it.Notably, for the part of the investigation that focused on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Mr. Mueller’s team gathered information from witnesses through voluntary F.B.I. interviews that are not shielded by grand-jury secrecy rules, according to lawyers familiar with the matter.ImageA Special Episode of ‘The Daily’: Robert Mueller Submits His ReportThe Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general.

So Mike, talk me through your day today.michael schmidtSo knowing it was going to be a big day, I turned on the recorder as soon as I left the house this morning and made my way into the office to hurry up and wait.[music]michael schmidtAll right. 10:05 a.m.michael schmidtI left my house at 10:00 a.m.michael schmidtWe expect the report to be finished today around noon.michael schmidtWalking down 17th Street, heading to the office.michael schmidtI got a call from the office from my editor wanting to know what I knew. Told her I knew nothing. Last thing an editor wants to hear — nothing new.michael schmidtNot a ton of people on the streets.speakerExcuse me.michael schmidtYes?speakerDo you know where the Jamaican Embassy is?michael schmidtI do not, I’m sorry.

Fairly cold here in Washington. 45 degrees.michael schmidtJust had a normal sort of walk into the office.michael schmidt[HUMMING] Half a block away, coming up to 17th —michael barbaroIt doesn’t seem like you’re in a big hurry to get to the office.michael schmidtWell, all the work has been done. We know what’s coming.michael schmidtHow are you?speakerHey, Mike.michael schmidtWhat’s going on?michael schmidtSo come into the building.michael schmidtBig day? No? Not a big day? All right.michael schmidtGet on the elevator.elevator voice announcerFloor seven.michael schmidtWalk into the office. And everyone wants to know —speaker 1What do you got?

We’re all ready.speakerGang’s all here.michael schmidtThere’s been a lot of time and planning that’s gone into this. There’s a lot of stories that have been written that are ready to go.speakerDoes that seem right?michael schmidtYep.speakerO.K.michael schmidtEveryone’s sitting around waiting, and they want answers.dean baquetSo what’s the latest?michael schmidtDean Baquet, our executive editor, calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller, our bureau chief, what do you know?elisabeth bumillerYou’re not so sure about it?michael schmidtI’m less sure about the timing, but —michael schmidtElizabeth calls me over to her desk, puts him on speakerphone. Mikey, what do you know?dean baquetDo you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get?michael schmidtMy guess is not a lot because I don’t know what there is to get a heads-up on.michael schmidtAnd I said, I don’t know.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] You tell them that you don’t know.michael schmidtWe don’t know!dean baquetO.K.elisabeth bumillerThat’s what we got.michael schmidtSo that’s all we got.elisabeth bumillerAnd we have stories ready. Once we get the word from Justice, we just push a button.michael schmidtAll the work is done.elisabeth bumillerWe’re just tourists hanging around.michael schmidtWe’re sort of lemmings at this point.michael schmidtSo it’s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts.michael barbaro[LAUGHS]michael schmidtAnd then it happens.archived recordingThe special counsel investigation is over. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.michael barbaroSo what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?michael schmidtOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.michael barbaroIs that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?michael schmidtWe just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.michael barbaroSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.michael schmidtCorrect. And it’s a very difficult process, because if there is criminality in regards to the president, it’s a very tricky issue to navigate. The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can’t be indicted. But if the president can’t be indicted, Congress should deal with that behavior. How do you give that information to Congress? It’s not a snap decision you can make — like, O.K., Mueller’s done, this is what he found. Let’s put this in another box and send it to Congress. It’s far trickier.michael barbaroSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report?michael schmidtBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.michael barbaroAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend, in your mind, Mike, on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends?michael schmidtYes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.michael barbaroAnd on the other hand, if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president, how does Barr have to proceed?michael schmidtWell, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.michael barbaroIs it safe to say though, Mike, that if criminality is found by Mueller, Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found?michael schmidtMaybe. Maybe. But look, this is a highly unusual situation. The person who runs the executive branch, the president, has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months. Very awkward situation.michael barbaroAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president.michael schmidtCorrect. Has the job because the president put him there. So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says, well, how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts?michael barbaroSo when will we know more? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front?michael schmidtOh, now you want to know more.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] Yes, please.michael schmidtThe greed of the news business.michael barbaroIf you’ll indulge us.michael schmidtWhen will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.michael barbaroSo now we wait again.michael schmidtHurry up and wait.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroIn a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress sent on Friday afternoon, Attorney General William Barr said he would brief them on the major conclusions of the special counsel’s report as soon as this weekend. On Friday evening, The Times reported that Mueller is not recommending any new charges against President Trump or anyone else around him. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Monday.A more sweeping obstacle will be any information that Mr. Trump seeks to shield by invoking executive privilege — the power to keep secret information whose disclosure could inhibit the executive branch’s ability to carry out its constitutional functions, like chilling the candor of internal deliberations.There are two categories of information that may be protected by executive privilege: communications involving the president — which would most likely apply only to events after Mr. Trump was sworn in — and internal agency deliberations, including investigative files covering the campaign and transition.But the scope and limits of executive privilege are murky. Courts have held that Congress also has a right to gain access to information it needs to carry out its own constitutional functions of conducting oversight and enacting legislation.Because these rival imperatives overlap, courts have encouraged presidents and lawmakers to resolve disputes by negotiating compromises to accommodate both branches’ needs, like letting lawmakers read certain documents but not take copies of them. As a result, few disputes have resulted in definitive judicial rulings that could serve as guideposts if both sides dig in over the Mueller files.In recent years, the line the Justice Department has tried to hold has eroded because Republicans repeatedly demanded and gained access to internal law-enforcement information generated during the Obama era, including going to court to obtain department emails about how to respond to congressional inquiries about the gun trafficking investigation called Fast and Furious.Republican lawmakers also obtained information about the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, including a record of her F.B.I. interview and — with Mr. Trump’s help — information about the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation, including an intelligence wiretap order targeting Carter Page, a former adviser to the Trump campaign with links to Russia.“A constitutional conflict is very likely in this circumstance,” said Mark J. Rozell, author of the book “Executive Privilege: Presidential Power, Secrecy and Accountability.”“I don’t see the House backing down from its request to get access to the full record, and the president is certainly not going to allow that to happen to the extent that he can stop it,” he added. “This may need a judicial resolution.”Michael S.

Barr has said he wants to be as transparent as possible but also that he will act consistently with the Justice Department’s regulations for special counsels.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The makings of an epic constitutional battle over the executive branch’s power to keep information secret from Congress started to take shape on Friday, as Attorney General William P. Barr began to weigh how much to disclose about the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.As Mr. Barr officially informed Congress that Mr. Mueller had handed in his long-awaited report about the Trump-Russia investigation to the Justice Department, Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately reiterated their demands to see the entire document — and more.Democrats have made clear they are also determined to gain access to the Mueller team’s supporting evidence and other investigative files, virtually guaranteeing a fight.“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the attorney general, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.In a letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he might release Mr. Mueller’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend. He is expected to take a longer time to review the broader report for information that is classified, subject to grand-jury secrecy rules or relevant to any open investigation before deciding what to show to Congress.Mr. Barr also plans to consult with the White House about any confidential internal information, including private conversations of the president, that is potentially subject to executive privilege. Decisions about what to make public will be even more complicated.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe House voted unanimously this month for a nonbinding resolution demanding that lawmakers be permitted to read the entire report and that the public be allowed to see as much as the law allows — even though the Justice Department’s special counsel regulations, written by the Clinton administration after Ken Starr’s investigation into the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals, do not call for that. They also do not prohibit it.Asked about the report in recent days, President Trump said he wanted Mr. Barr to “let people see it.”Regardless of how much of the report is eventually disclosed, Democrats are also pushing for information and material Mr. Mueller gathered but did not put in the report. Such files could include documents and records of interviews with witnesses, as well as any internal memos the Mueller team wrote analyzing negative information about people whom it ultimately decided against indicting.The Justice Department traditionally opposes turning over such files — especially if they contain information relevant to investigations that remain open. Mr. Mueller has handed off many cases his office developed to regular Justice Department prosecutors for continued pursuit, and there remains a permanently open counterintelligence investigation into Russia.“We’re definitely on a collision course for a major fight at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue over both the Mueller report, testimony related to it and the underlying case files,” said Andrew Wright, who specialized in executive privilege matters as a White House lawyer in the Obama administration and was a congressional oversight staff member.Such a fight would play out politically — with accusations by Democrats of a cover-up and by Republicans of legislative overreach — and legally. Democrats would begin with a House subpoena to Mr. Barr, followed by a vote to hold him in contempt over whatever he does not turn over.The House would then file a lawsuit to enforce its subpoena, asking a court to order Mr. Barr to comply with it. That would require the judge to decide whether Mr. Barr had a lawful basis to disregard the subpoena, including whether any invocation of executive privilege by Mr. Trump was legitimate.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Anticipating a lengthy fight, Democrats have already moved to gain access another way to some of the information Mr. Mueller gathered: by asking his witnesses who provided materials to him to give them copies of the same records. Swiftly recreating as much of Mr. Mueller’s files as possible was a key strategy behind letters the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, sent to 81 people and organizations this month asking for records.The committee so far has received tens of thousands of pages, but the most sensitive information gathered is available only from Mr. Mueller, leaving plenty to fight over.The top Democrats on six House committees issued a joint statement on Friday night calling on the Justice Department not only to release to the public “the entire report,” but also to give their panels “the underlying evidence uncovered during the course of the special counsel’s investigation” upon request.One potential obstacle will be information that is classified, like material that could reveal a secret source of intelligence about the Russian government. The executive branch traditionally limits highly sensitive information to the intelligence committees or even just the top “Gang of Eight” congressional leaders.Another potential hurdle will be information that Mr. Mueller used a grand jury to gather, such as records and testimony he obtained by subpoena. Federal rules of criminal procedure generally bar disclosure of such materials to outsiders — a limit that, on its face, makes no exception for Congress.Still, a judge could issue an order permitting grand jury information to be shared with Congress, as happened in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. A key question would be whether the Trump administration consents to such a request — as the Nixon administration did — or fights it.Notably, for the part of the investigation that focused on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Mr. Mueller’s team gathered information from witnesses through voluntary F.B.I. interviews that are not shielded by grand-jury secrecy rules, according to lawyers familiar with the matter.ImageA Special Episode of ‘The Daily’: Robert Mueller Submits His ReportThe Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general.

Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.michael barbaroSo now we wait again.michael schmidtHurry up and wait.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroIn a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress sent on Friday afternoon, Attorney General William Barr said he would brief them on the major conclusions of the special counsel’s report as soon as this weekend.

Courts have held that Congress also has a right to gain access to information it needs to carry out its own constitutional functions of conducting oversight and enacting legislation.Because these rival imperatives overlap, courts have encouraged presidents and lawmakers to resolve disputes by negotiating compromises to accommodate both branches’ needs, like letting lawmakers read certain documents but not take copies of them. As a result, few disputes have resulted in definitive judicial rulings that could serve as guideposts if both sides dig in over the Mueller files.In recent years, the line the Justice Department has tried to hold has eroded because Republicans repeatedly demanded and gained access to internal law-enforcement information generated during the Obama era, including going to court to obtain department emails about how to respond to congressional inquiries about the gun trafficking investigation called Fast and Furious.Republican lawmakers also obtained information about the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, including a record of her F.B.I. interview and — with Mr. Trump’s help — information about the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation, including an intelligence wiretap order targeting Carter Page, a former adviser to the Trump campaign with links to Russia.“A constitutional conflict is very likely in this circumstance,” said Mark J. Rozell, author of the book “Executive Privilege: Presidential Power, Secrecy and Accountability.”“I don’t see the House backing down from its request to get access to the full record, and the president is certainly not going to allow that to happen to the extent that he can stop it,” he added. “This may need a judicial resolution.”Michael S.

Barr has said he wants to be as transparent as possible but also that he will act consistently with the Justice Department’s regulations for special counsels.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageMarch 22, 2019WASHINGTON — The makings of an epic constitutional battle over the executive branch’s power to keep information secret from Congress started to take shape on Friday, as Attorney General William P. Barr began to weigh how much to disclose about the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.As Mr. Barr officially informed Congress that Mr. Mueller had handed in his long-awaited report about the Trump-Russia investigation to the Justice Department, Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately reiterated their demands to see the entire document — and more.Democrats have made clear they are also determined to gain access to the Mueller team’s supporting evidence and other investigative files, virtually guaranteeing a fight.“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the attorney general, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.In a letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he might release Mr. Mueller’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend. He is expected to take a longer time to review the broader report for information that is classified, subject to grand-jury secrecy rules or relevant to any open investigation before deciding what to show to Congress.Mr. Barr also plans to consult with the White House about any confidential internal information, including private conversations of the president, that is potentially subject to executive privilege. Decisions about what to make public will be even more complicated.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe House voted unanimously this month for a nonbinding resolution demanding that lawmakers be permitted to read the entire report and that the public be allowed to see as much as the law allows — even though the Justice Department’s special counsel regulations, written by the Clinton administration after Ken Starr’s investigation into the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals, do not call for that. They also do not prohibit it.Asked about the report in recent days, President Trump said he wanted Mr. Barr to “let people see it.”Regardless of how much of the report is eventually disclosed, Democrats are also pushing for information and material Mr. Mueller gathered but did not put in the report. Such files could include documents and records of interviews with witnesses, as well as any internal memos the Mueller team wrote analyzing negative information about people whom it ultimately decided against indicting.The Justice Department traditionally opposes turning over such files — especially if they contain information relevant to investigations that remain open. Mr. Mueller has handed off many cases his office developed to regular Justice Department prosecutors for continued pursuit, and there remains a permanently open counterintelligence investigation into Russia.“We’re definitely on a collision course for a major fight at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue over both the Mueller report, testimony related to it and the underlying case files,” said Andrew Wright, who specialized in executive privilege matters as a White House lawyer in the Obama administration and was a congressional oversight staff member.Such a fight would play out politically — with accusations by Democrats of a cover-up and by Republicans of legislative overreach — and legally. Democrats would begin with a House subpoena to Mr. Barr, followed by a vote to hold him in contempt over whatever he does not turn over.The House would then file a lawsuit to enforce its subpoena, asking a court to order Mr. Barr to comply with it. That would require the judge to decide whether Mr. Barr had a lawful basis to disregard the subpoena, including whether any invocation of executive privilege by Mr. Trump was legitimate.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Anticipating a lengthy fight, Democrats have already moved to gain access another way to some of the information Mr. Mueller gathered: by asking his witnesses who provided materials to him to give them copies of the same records. Swiftly recreating as much of Mr. Mueller’s files as possible was a key strategy behind letters the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, sent to 81 people and organizations this month asking for records.The committee so far has received tens of thousands of pages, but the most sensitive information gathered is available only from Mr. Mueller, leaving plenty to fight over.The top Democrats on six House committees issued a joint statement on Friday night calling on the Justice Department not only to release to the public “the entire report,” but also to give their panels “the underlying evidence uncovered during the course of the special counsel’s investigation” upon request.One potential obstacle will be information that is classified, like material that could reveal a secret source of intelligence about the Russian government. The executive branch traditionally limits highly sensitive information to the intelligence committees or even just the top “Gang of Eight” congressional leaders.Another potential hurdle will be information that Mr. Mueller used a grand jury to gather, such as records and testimony he obtained by subpoena. Federal rules of criminal procedure generally bar disclosure of such materials to outsiders — a limit that, on its face, makes no exception for Congress.Still, a judge could issue an order permitting grand jury information to be shared with Congress, as happened in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. A key question would be whether the Trump administration consents to such a request — as the Nixon administration did — or fights it.Notably, for the part of the investigation that focused on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Mr. Mueller’s team gathered information from witnesses through voluntary F.B.I. interviews that are not shielded by grand-jury secrecy rules, according to lawyers familiar with the matter.ImageA Special Episode of ‘The Daily’: Robert Mueller Submits His ReportThe Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general.

Here’s a look at what this means and what comes next.michael barbaroSo it’s here.michael schmidtWell, it’s in the hands of Bill Barr. It’s not here in the sense that we can publicly consume it and see what Bob Mueller found. It has just moved from one pocket, which we can’t see into, into another pocket that we can’t see into.michael barbaroBut it has moved pockets, at least, which is something. Something we’ve been waiting two years for.michael schmidtCorrect. Bob Mueller is done with his investigation.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is a special episode of “The Daily.” Today: The Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general. It’s Friday afternoon, March 22. So Mike, talk me through your day today.michael schmidtSo knowing it was going to be a big day, I turned on the recorder as soon as I left the house this morning and made my way into the office to hurry up and wait.[music]michael schmidtAll right. 10:05 a.m.michael schmidtI left my house at 10:00 a.m.michael schmidtWe expect the report to be finished today around noon.michael schmidtWalking down 17th Street, heading to the office.michael schmidtI got a call from the office from my editor wanting to know what I knew. Told her I knew nothing. Last thing an editor wants to hear — nothing new.michael schmidtNot a ton of people on the streets.speakerExcuse me.michael schmidtYes?speakerDo you know where the Jamaican Embassy is?michael schmidtI do not, I’m sorry. Do you know what the address is?michael schmidtWas stopped by a woman who couldn’t find the Jamaican embassy.michael schmidtO.K., so you’re going to want to go this way. Go to DuPont Circle, and make a right. Just keep on following that trail.speakerOh, O.K., so I’m going the wrong way.michael schmidtWell, we’re all going the wrong way.michael schmidtCome up to Massachusetts Avenue.michael schmidtCold March day. Fairly cold here in Washington. 45 degrees.michael schmidtJust had a normal sort of walk into the office.michael schmidt[HUMMING] Half a block away, coming up to 17th —michael barbaroIt doesn’t seem like you’re in a big hurry to get to the office.michael schmidtWell, all the work has been done. We know what’s coming.michael schmidtHow are you?speakerHey, Mike.michael schmidtWhat’s going on?michael schmidtSo come into the building.michael schmidtBig day? No? Not a big day? All right.michael schmidtGet on the elevator.elevator voice announcerFloor seven.michael schmidtWalk into the office. And everyone wants to know —speaker 1What do you got? What do you got?speaker 2Chasing the report.michael schmidtWhen’s it going to happen?speakerThis is the question I ask him every five —michael schmidtDays or —speakerDays or weeks.michael schmidtDays or weeks?michael schmidtThe whole apparatus of The New York Times is jacked up for this moment.michael schmidtWe got Nick here. We’re all ready.speakerGang’s all here.michael schmidtThere’s been a lot of time and planning that’s gone into this. There’s a lot of stories that have been written that are ready to go.speakerDoes that seem right?michael schmidtYep.speakerO.K.michael schmidtEveryone’s sitting around waiting, and they want answers.dean baquetSo what’s the latest?michael schmidtDean Baquet, our executive editor, calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller, our bureau chief, what do you know?elisabeth bumillerYou’re not so sure about it?michael schmidtI’m less sure about the timing, but —michael schmidtElizabeth calls me over to her desk, puts him on speakerphone. Mikey, what do you know?dean baquetDo you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get?michael schmidtMy guess is not a lot because I don’t know what there is to get a heads-up on.michael schmidtAnd I said, I don’t know.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] You tell them that you don’t know.michael schmidtWe don’t know!dean baquetO.K.elisabeth bumillerThat’s what we got.michael schmidtSo that’s all we got.elisabeth bumillerAnd we have stories ready. Once we get the word from Justice, we just push a button.michael schmidtAll the work is done.elisabeth bumillerWe’re just tourists hanging around.michael schmidtWe’re sort of lemmings at this point.michael schmidtSo it’s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts.michael barbaro[LAUGHS]michael schmidtAnd then it happens.archived recordingThe special counsel investigation is over. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.michael barbaroSo what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?michael schmidtOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.michael barbaroIs that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?michael schmidtWe just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.michael barbaroSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.michael schmidtCorrect. And it’s a very difficult process, because if there is criminality in regards to the president, it’s a very tricky issue to navigate. The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can’t be indicted. But if the president can’t be indicted, Congress should deal with that behavior. How do you give that information to Congress? It’s not a snap decision you can make — like, O.K., Mueller’s done, this is what he found. Let’s put this in another box and send it to Congress. It’s far trickier.michael barbaroSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report?michael schmidtBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.michael barbaroAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend, in your mind, Mike, on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends?michael schmidtYes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.michael barbaroAnd on the other hand, if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president, how does Barr have to proceed?michael schmidtWell, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.michael barbaroIs it safe to say though, Mike, that if criminality is found by Mueller, Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found?michael schmidtMaybe. Maybe. But look, this is a highly unusual situation. The person who runs the executive branch, the president, has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months. Very awkward situation.michael barbaroAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president.michael schmidtCorrect. Has the job because the president put him there. So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says, well, how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts?michael barbaroSo when will we know more? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front?michael schmidtOh, now you want to know more.michael barbaro[LAUGHS] Yes, please.michael schmidtThe greed of the news business.michael barbaroIf you’ll indulge us.michael schmidtWhen will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.michael barbaroAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands?michael schmidtBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation.

He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.michael barbaroAnd Mike, what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that’s sent to Congress, but from something else? I think we’re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak, and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory.michael schmidtYeah.michael barbaroWill it leak?michael schmidtI don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public.

Ms. Abbott, a prominent critic of Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, said the term was “an outdated, offensive and revealing choice of words.”Ms. Rudd, a Conservative, said on Twitter that she was “mortified at my clumsy language and sorry to @HackneyAbbott.”In the radio interview with the BBC, Ms. Rudd was responding to a question about abuse on Twitter being aimed overwhelmingly at women.“It definitely is worse if you’re a woman, and it’s worst of all if you’re a colored woman,” Ms. Rudd said. “I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, and I think that’s something we need to continue to call out.”In her tweet, she added, “My point stands: that no one should suffer abuse because of their race or gender.”ImageThe lawmaker Diane Abbott, center, at a rally with the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, right, in January in Hastings, England. She said the term was “an outdated, offensive and revealing choice of words.”CreditJack Taylor/Getty ImagesIt was part of another round of apologies in the British government. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, also apologized on Thursday after suggesting that the killings by British soldiers and police officers during the decades-long, bloody conflict known as the Troubles were not crimes. She faces calls to resign.Last month, a white former member of the Labour Party, Angela Smith, apologized after a BBC discussion on racism during which she described people of color as having “a funny tinge.” Ms. Smith blamed tiredness for having “misspoke really badly.”In January, Ms. Abbott said she had been mocked and unfairly interrupted during the BBC show “Question Time,” accusing the political program of legitimizing racist abuse.Another Labour member of Parliament, Danielle Rowley, said of Ms. Rudd, “She clearly gets her language from the same bygone era as her abhorrent welfare policies.”She was referring to Ms. Rudd’s oversight of the rollout of a new benefits system called universal credit. The system merged six separate benefits into a single payment, but it has forced people to wait for their first payment, throwing families into debt.A charity found that the use of food banks picked up much more in areas where the new system was in place than in areas where it wasn’t.Ms. Rudd resigned as home secretary last year amid a scandal over the British government’s harsh treatment of immigrants known as the Windrush generation, longtime legal residents of West Indian and Caribbean ancestry. Some lost their jobs or were denied medical care because they could not prove that they had lived in the country since before 1973.In a cabinet that is split over Britain’s departure from the European Union, Ms. Rudd is a leading member of the pro-European side that is pushing for a closer relationship with the bloc.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Colored Woman’ Quip Prompts an Apology.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|White Meat or Dark? Carving Up BrexitAdvertisementSupported byWhite Meat or Dark? Carving Up BrexitImageA butcher shop in London. For decades, farmers have been able to sell cuts that Britons shun in Europe, but Brexit could change that.CreditCreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesBy Benjamin MuellerMarch 5, 2019LONDON — On his poultry operation outside Manchester, England, Michael Bailey used to raise turkeys and sell them at Christmastime. The whole bird.But most British customers now want their meat cut up, boneless and, most vexingly to farmers, white, not dark. So Mr. Bailey breaks down his birds, leaving behind a pile of unwanted thighs and drumsticks.“We’ve got a high-value turkey, and half of it — well, nearly half of it — they don’t want,” he said. “This causes us a major problem.”For decades, the answer to that problem was the European Union: a frictionless market with idiosyncratic tastes, in which eastern countries crave the dark meat that Britons do not. Along with the turkey leftovers, dark-meat chicken and aging pigs from British farms often land on plates in Eastern Europe, while white meat travels the opposite way. Britons can eat what they want while farmers export what they do not.But now, as with so many other areas of trade and business, Britain’s impending withdrawal from the bloc, the process known as Brexit, stands to throw off the gustatory balance.“We’ve had sort of 20 years of being able to eat what we want, when we want,” said Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council. “That’s a privilege. And I don’t think that privilege has really been valued or recognized universally across the country.”Farmers know this little-noticed quirk of the meat trade as carcass balance: One country’s leftovers are another’s prized cuts.Most industries fear Brexit because they need parts from across Europe, often delivered on a tight schedule, to assemble goods like cars or airplane wings. But British farmers are in the business of disassembly, and losing a major market for animal parts could be devastating.ImageThe British Poultry Council has called for a campaign pitching dark-meat chicken as a healthier alternative to beef.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesTake the pork trade. Britons hunger for the loin and the leg. They eat about 23 million pigs’ worth of loins annually, most of it in the form of back bacon, and 19 million pigs’ worth of legs, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. But only about 10 million pigs are slaughtered each year in Britain, meaning the country needs to import those cuts.By contrast, Britons eat only about seven million pigs’ worth of pork shoulder, and belly meat ranks even lower, about five million pigs per year. If British farmers cannot sell their extra shoulders and bellies abroad, the pork market collapses.“We need to trade with member states because some parts of the carcass command a better price there,” said Ivor Ferguson, a farmer from Northern Ireland who once raised pigs and now focuses on sheep and cereal crops.Inconveniently for farmers, providing more in-demand cuts means having to find more places to sell the unwanted cuts. When it comes to poultry, Mr. Ferguson said, “If we want to increase consumption of breast meat in the U.K. market, we have to be able to get rid of the dark meat.”Leaving the European Union without some sort of trade deal would be most disastrous for farmers. British pork could face tariffs of around 40 percent, while beef and chicken could face tariffs above 60 percent. Strict border inspections would also add costs and cause delays in many cases.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has promised that Britain will apply tariffs to food imports to protect British farmers. But he said delays at the ports would be dangerous.“Farmers, especially small farmers, would face barriers to trade,” Mr. Gove told a farming conference in January.But even well short of a no-deal split from Europe, Brexit will create snags in what is now a virtually seamless trading process, adding veterinary costs and border checks. And if farmers cannot make as much money as they once did from dark meat exports, they may be forced to raise prices for white meat chicken, creating what analysts fear will be a two-tier market in which only richer Britons can afford the best fresh chicken.New trade deals could also open the British market to cheaper meat, none more alarming to Britons than chlorine-washed chicken from the United States.ImageA poultry show in Telford, England. Britain exports between 250,000 and 300,000 tons of dark meat chicken a year, about 70 percent of it to the European Union.CreditOli Scarff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFarmers are trying to adjust now, among other things by persuading Britons to start eating cuts they now ignore. Analysts have pitched dark-meat chicken as a healthier alternative to beef, and suggested furnishing Britons with more recipes for how to cook it.Some companies are already slipping dark meat into their recipes. Mr. Bailey, who processes free range and organic chicken, said he sells poultry to a maker of meat pies that for years bought only white breast meat, forcing Mr. Bailey to find another taker for the remaining three-quarters of the bird.But by promising better prices, he tempted the pie maker to try dark meat, too. Six months of cooking tests later, and with dollops of sauce disguising the chicken cut, the pie maker now buys dark meat, too, Mr. Bailey said.“In fact, it enhanced the flavor of the pie,” Mr. Bailey said. “It was a bit of a win in the end.”There is a long road ahead. Britain exports between 250,000 and 300,000 tons of dark meat chicken a year, about 70 percent of it to the European Union, according to ResPublica, a British think tank.Over the decades since technology made it easy for producers to portion and debone meat, people not only developed a taste for certain parts of the bird but also forgot how to cook the whole thing, Mr. Griffiths said. Reversing that trend could take years, he said, though Brexit could very well drive up the price of white meat chicken enough that people would no longer have a choice.“We’ve built up a marketplace where we export dark meat and the value we get from it helps keep down food prices in the U.K.,” he said.The growing importance of the Asian market could soften the blow for pig farmers. China has become a significant buyer of the least pricey parts of the pig, like the feet, and losing the European market might be easier to weather than losing the Asian market. Some less popular cuts like pork belly are also appearing more and more on British restaurant menus, analysts say.Still, farmers can ill afford any upheaval in trade at a moment when Brexit — and the prospect of new immigration restrictions — is already costing them workers. Mr. Bailey said roughly two-thirds of the employees in his poultry operation were from Europe.And certain exports could be stranded in Britain, especially female pigs. After spending their lives breeding in Britain, the pigs are often sent to Germany for processing into sausages. But the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said in a report released in February that tariffs on agriculture exports would make the practice “uneconomical.”Instead, farmers may be forced to pay to have them killed and disposed of in Britain.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: White Meat or Dark?

The Curious Case of ‘Failing Grayling’ImageBritain’s transport secretary, Chris Grayling, leaving the weekly cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street, has botched a string of government jobs but mysteriously survives.CreditCreditAdrian Dennis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Benjamin MuellerMarch 3, 2019LONDON — They call him “Failing Grayling.”While the trials, tribulations and humiliations of Prime Minister Theresa May have occupied center stage in the carnival of British politics, Chris Grayling has starred in a black comedy sideshow of his own. He has bumbled his way from one government post to another, accused of making a hash of each, and becoming a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain.To take one of his most recent missteps, as transport minister trying to guard against the chaos that could accompany Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, he awarded an $18 million contract for extra ferries to handle cross-channel trade — to a company that owned no ferries.And it didn’t end there. This past week, the government was forced to cough up 33 million pounds, about $44 million, to settle a lawsuit brought by Eurotunnel, which complained that it was unfairly prevented from bidding on the ferry contracts, which were negotiated in secret.While the ferry fiasco was unfolding, Mr. Grayling organized a spectacularly ineffectual demonstration of Britain’s ability to deal with the backups of truck traffic expected in a no-deal Brexit. Those traffic jams could contain thousands of trucks, but for the test, he called for just 150, and only 89 turned up.On Friday, the opposition Labour Party chimed in with a report claiming that Mr. Grayling’s various misadventures — 12 in all — had cost British taxpayers 2.7 billion pounds, or $3.6 billion.“If anyone was to read the most rudimentary audit about the effects of his time in office on the things he’s supposed to be running, he’d have been out years ago,” said Ian Dunt, the author of “Brexit: What the Hell Happens Now.” “But that’s not the manner in which the country is currently being run.”ImagePro-Brexit protesters outside Parliament in London. Mr. Grayling is a rare breed of Conservative politician, both a loyalist of Prime Minister Theresa May and a strongly pro-Brexit campaigner.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersWhile Mr. Grayling’s survival in the leadership has baffled many Britons, the reason, analysts say, is simple: Brexit. He is a rare breed of Conservative politician, one who is both a loyalist of Prime Minister Theresa May and a strongly pro-Brexit campaigner, but without the ideological baggage of the far right. Until Brexit happens, the combination makes him virtually impossible to fire.“The lot of Brexiteers who are willing to work with Theresa May and aren’t bonkers is quite small,” said Rob Ford, a politics professor at the University of Manchester. “And one can argue he’s incompetent, but he’s not a flaming ideologue.”A former BBC producer and public relations consultant, Mr. Grayling got his start when the Conservative Party chose him in 2001 to run for a seat the party had held since 1885. Charlie Mansell, the sacrificial lamb put up by Labour to run against him, said that with victory assured, Mr. Grayling did not appear to see much reason to actually campaign for the seat.“It was almost like, ‘This is a historically Conservative seat, and I’m inheriting it,’ ” Mr. Mansell said of Mr. Grayling. “He didn’t really pitch anything on his expertise or skill set at the time.”Retelling the story of Mr. Grayling’s mistakes has become a cottage industry in Westminster political circles. At the 2009 Conservative Party conference, he called a major personnel choice by David Cameron, then party leader, a “political gimmick,” thinking that Labour had made the appointment.Starting in 2012, as the first justice secretary in 400-plus years without a law degree, he introduced changes that threw the legal system into an uproar. He banned books in prisons, partly privatized probation and cut lawyers’ fees for criminal legal aid by nearly 18 percent, decimating the profession. His successor from the same party, Michael Gove, promptly reversed many of the measures.ImageA view of Dover ferry port. In preparation for the potential chaos of a no-deal Brexit, Mr. Grayling awarded an $18 million contract for extra ferries to a company that owned no ferries.CreditLeon Neal/Getty ImagesBut the horrid pay and huge caseloads scared off a generation of lawyers, said Richard Miller, the head of justice at the Law Society.“We’ve not quite yet got to the stage where someone has asked for a lawyer in a police station and they haven’t been able to get one, but we’ve come very close,” he said.At the Justice Ministry, Mr. Grayling did not show enough concern for principles like keeping some judicial matters in public view or giving people access to courts in their communities, said Simon Hughes, who worked for part of the same period as a justice minister from the centrist Liberal Democrats. His office endlessly delayed answering parliamentary questions while political advisers hashed out the right answers, Mr. Hughes said.“He saw everything through a very party-political optic,” Mr. Hughes said.His flagging political profile got a lift when, after backing Brexit in the 2016 referendum campaign, he ran Mrs. May’s campaign for party leader. Having the support of a Brexiteer was crucial for Mrs. May, who had backed staying in the European Union.Naming Mr. Grayling the transport secretary helped resolve one of her main preoccupations as prime minister, former advisers said: having an even balance of pro- and anti-Brexit ministers in her cabinet. Other Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab quit their high-profile posts, but Mr. Grayling remained a stalwart supporter.He was also popular on the right for comments disavowed by lawmakers of his own party, like saying in 2010 that Christian bed-and-breakfast owners should be able to refuse gay guests. Given Mrs. May’s political fragility, analysts said, she has decided not to fire Mr. Grayling and risk the upheaval of another cabinet reshuffle.ImageMr. Grayling followed up the ferry fiasco with an exercise to demonstrate Britain’s ability to deal with the backups of truck traffic expected in a no-deal Brexit, but only 89 of the expected 150 trucks turned up.CreditGlyn Kirk/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“It is the very old story of people’s government positions being defined by their function within the Conservative Party,” said Mr. Dunt, “rather than their capacity to deliver on the thing they’re ostensibly in charge of.”As transportation secretary, he has been trailed by calls for his resignation. He introduced new railway timetables last spring, only for hundreds of trains to be canceled each day on certain lines. A review found that Mr. Grayling had been warned weeks in advance of the impending chaos, and yet “nobody took charge.”Brexit created more difficulties. A no-deal Brexit would mean severing longstanding agreements controlling how trucks and ferries cross between Britain and the rest of Europe. The Transportation Ministry tried to prepare by putting out a call for contracts for backup ferry operators, but it got many fewer bids than it expected, among them one from the ferryless ferry company, transportation experts said.Mr. Grayling insisted he was supporting a start-up British business, even after it came out that the company had copied its terms of service from a takeout food website. He had to cancel the contract last month after the company’s financial backer withdrew, leaving the government out the 800,000 pounds, around $1 million, it had paid consultants.“If you’re planning for a no-deal scenario, you’ve got to take risks, I guess, and this is what happens,” said Andrew Forster, the editor of Local Transport Today. “I don’t see how you can blame Chris Grayling for that situation.”Some analysts have detected what they hope may be a silver lining in Mr. Grayling’s fumblings. He is so bad at disguising his mistakes, and so tempting a target for the tabloids, that they say he has single-handedly forced the British public to pay attention to mundane problems like ferry shortages that otherwise may have gotten buried in the papers.“Once Chris Grayling comes in, you can sell almost any article on the basis of just, ‘Look at what this guy has monstrously messed up now,’ ” Mr. Dunt said. “People really enjoy disliking him.”Correction: March 3, 2019Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the amount that a Labour Party’s report claimed Chris Grayling misadventures had cost British taxpayers. It is 2.7 billion pounds, not 2.7 million.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Stumbles Galore, but ‘Failing’ British Politician Is Still Standing.

Are Budget Cuts to Blame? - The New York Times

Are Budget Cuts to Blame?ImagePolice officers conferring at the scene of a stabbing in Birmingham, England, last year.CreditCreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesBy Benjamin MuellerMarch 6, 2019LONDON — Two recent, high-profile stabbing deaths have reignited a debate in Britain over whether a nationwide decline in the number of police officers is behind an alarming increase in knifings.The clash has divided the Conservative cabinet, with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, demanding millions of pounds in emergency funding for the police, and Prime Minister Theresa May rejecting a linkage between knife crimes and cutbacks in the number of officers.Lost in the back and forth about the smaller police forces is another element — the stringent overall reductions in public spending under the government’s austerity program, analysts say.For example, the police now spend hours answering calls involving mentally ill people and sitting with them in hospitals, work that had been done by agencies that have suffered their own funding cuts or been eliminated entirely.Some analysts say that the policy of austerity cuts — a centerpiece of the Conservative Party’s agenda for the last decade — is helping to drive people toward crime, including vulnerable young people who had been helped by social services.“The public sector service getting all the money but also the blame is the police,” said Katrina Ffrench, the chief executive of StopWatch, a group that campaigns against the use of police stops and searches. “If we had more investment in intervention to support young people not getting involved in criminality in the first place, or to support people involved in criminality, you wouldn’t need to have the policing response.”ImageBritain’s prime minister, Theresa May, at her offices at 10 Downing Street in London, on Tuesday. She rejects the linkage of police cuts to rising knife crime.CreditTolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAnswering questions from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and other members of Parliament on Wednesday, Mrs. May again denied that funding reductions had driven up violent crime, but said she would hold a summit in the coming days and meet with victims of what she described as a “growing cycle of violence that has shocked us all.”“We do ensure police have the right resources,” Mrs. May said.During a meeting with Mr. Javid on Wednesday, police leaders said they pressed the home secretary to add more officers and remove restrictions on the use of stop and search.Mr. Javid’s office and Mrs. May’s office would not comment on reports that they clashed in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday over police funding.Outrage waxes and wanes in the British press and among government ministers in accordance with the severity of the crime and, all too often, the race, class and ethnicity of victims. The latest public furor was prompted by the killings of two teenagers: Jodie Chesney, 17, who is white, and was stabbed by a stranger in an east London park on Friday night; and Yousef Ghaleb Makki, also 17, a private school student who was stabbed near Manchester the next day.But there is no doubt that knife crime is a growing problem, with such offenses rising for the
fourth straight year, to just under 43,000 offenses in the year ending Sept. 30, 2018, the most since the government started recording comparable data in 2011. Still, rates of violent crime in Britain remain low by American standards, and since the mid-1990s Britain has registered a marked decline in such crime.Mrs. May’s government announced an additional $1.2 billion for the police in mid-December. But her refusal to accede to police leaders’ demands that she take responsibility for the uptick in knife crimes or to invest even more money in the police has become a political liability as she struggles to push her Brexit deal through Parliament.The issue hurt her in the last election in 2017, and Mr. Corbyn on Wednesday again railed against the rise in violent crime that he said was driven by austerity cuts, saying, “You cannot keep communities safe on the cheap.”ImagePolice forensic officers in the Wood Green area of north London last month, where two men, believed to be aged 19 and 20, were shot and stabbed by a gang riding bikes.CreditDominic Lipinski/Press Association, via Associated PressThe Times of London on Wednesday ran a cartoon showing Mrs. May carving a bloody red line down a graph that tracked reductions in the number of police. (There are more than 20,000 fewer today than in 2010.)[Here’s a brief look at how austerity has refashioned policing, housing and welfare in the U.K.]Mrs. May’s defining characteristic in office has been a refusal to bend — on her unpopular Brexit deal, on hard-line immigration measures or on police cuts. But for a Conservative prime minister to keep up a fight with the police for so long is more remarkable.“It could either prove her undoing, or that will be her great legacy: the leader who stood firm and got what she wanted,” said Rick Muir, the director of the Police Foundation, a think tank.Still, analysts largely agree with Mrs. May that blaming violent crime on reductions in the number of police goes far beyond available evidence.“There’s just no research or evidence that demonstrates that,” Mr. Muir said. “On the other hand, we can’t rule out the idea that there may be a relationship, although it’s a complex one.”Research on how increased police patrols affect crime is mixed. Flooding an area with police, as occurred in certain parts of London in the weeks after terror attacks in 2005, seems to push down crime, suggesting that large, visible surges in police patrols have an effect.But gradual reductions in police numbers may not have an effect, researchers have said. And the evidence suggests that while bigger police forces can sometimes help reduce offenses like property crime, violent crime is much more resistant, given that it is usually carried out in the heat of the moment and most perpetrators are not caught.ImagePolice forensics officers search the area near where Jodie Chesney, 17, was killed, in Saint Neots Play Park in the Harold Hill neighborhood of east London.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersAnalysts said austerity cuts to social services, like youth centers and interventions for children who are expelled from school, seem to be a big part of what is driving some young people into crime.Take the illegal drug market. Local drug gangs in Britain used to deal most drugs outside major cities, but gangs based in the cities are now sending children into more rural areas to distribute them. That has created more competition and, analysts believe, more violence.But a large part of the reason those children are vulnerable to recruitment is that the youth centers where they once spent time have been closed, and the number of children expelled from school has grown rapidly, analysts said.Analysts worry that until the government tries to use what they call a public health model to address some of those root causes of violence, there will be no progress.“The police enforcement angle remains the dominant policy being pursued, despite it not being effective,” said Richard Garside, the director of the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London. “The public health angle is getting a bit more traction, but it is currently lacking consistent funding.”Mr. Javid’s hard-line approach may be rooted not only in his own beliefs — his brother is a senior police officer — but also in his leadership ambitions: With the Conservative Party split over Brexit, he has been positioning himself to become the next leader, and opposing Mrs. May on knife crime could help, analysts said.But as long as responses to knife crime are predominantly about political posturing, rather than evidence, analysts said, little will change. Versions of this week’s political uproar have occurred since 2007, when the prime minister, the Labour Party’s Tony Blair, led a Downing Street summit and then blamed knife violence on black culture, rather than poverty.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Knifings Surge, and Many in Britain Are Blaming Austerity.

Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel Investigated
By LARRY BUCHANAN and
KAREN YOURISH
MARCH 20, 2019
After more than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about contacts between associates of Donald J. Trump and Russia, we already know a lot about the work done by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Here are the main findings and lines of inquiry and the people involved in each.
The investigation has revealed a range of events related to Russian interference and the 2016 election.
Russian Hacking and WikiLeaks
As part of a complex effort to sabotage the campaign of Hillary Clinton, Donald J. Trump’s 2016 rival, Russia’s top military intelligence service hacked the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the private email account of the chairman of the Clinton campaign and released tens of thousands of stolen emails through WikiLeaks to the public, according to an indictment filed by Mr. Mueller. Only the Russians have been charged.

Russian Contacts
All told, Mr. Trump and more than a dozen of his associates had more than 100 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, during the campaign and transition. These included multiple offers of dirt on Mrs. Clinton, attempts to arrange “back-channel” meetings between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and private messages with WikiLeaks and other Russian fronts. At least 10 other advisers were told about these interactions but did not have any themselves.

Russian Sanctions
Several people close to Mr. Trump engaged in discussions about deals to give Russia relief from economic sanctions. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, had repeated conversations with a Russian business associate about a plan to end a guerrilla war between Russia and Ukraine that might have led to sanctions relief. Michael D. Cohen, the president’s longtime personal lawyer, delivered a sealed proposal to the office of Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national adviser, for the same purpose. Mr. Flynn also spoke with the Russian ambassador about sanctions (court documents show that Mr. Trump’s presidential transition team knew about these calls and coached Mr. Flynn on how to respond).

An Israeli company was asked to provide a proposal for using social media manipulation to help defeat Mrs. Clinton. And an informal adviser to Mr. Trump’s team during the presidential transition attended a meeting in the Seychelles that was convened by the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates.

It’s here.The special counsel, Robert Mueller, delivered a report on his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election to Attorney General William Barr.It was the apparent close of an investigation that has captivated the nation and cast a shadow over President Trump for nearly two years. We don’t yet know the report’s contents. Mr. Barr will now decide how much of it to share with Congress and, by extension, the public. Above, Mr. Mueller leaving the Capitol in 2017.Mr. Mueller will not recommend that any new charges be filed, a senior Justice Department official said.

Kirkpatrick for The New York Times2. The path to the report’s potential release is complicated. The House voted unanimously this month to make its findings public, and now it’s up to Attorney General William Barr, pictured above, to decide how much of it to share.In a letter to congressional leaders, he said he might brief them within days. House Democrats are already calling for the release of not only the full report, but also the underlying documents and findings. In a joint statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York urged Mr. Barr not to give the White House a “sneak preview” of the report before the public can see it.Watch our video guide to how we got here.

President Trump rolled back sanctions against North Korea today, confusing advisers who had put them in place only a day earlier. The move, announced on Twitter, was a remarkable display of dissension in the Trump administration. The Treasury announced sanctions Thursday on two Chinese shipping companies it said were helping North Korea evade international sanctions.The sanctions came weeks after a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, collapsed without a nuclear deal.

A gatekeeper for recruited athletes applying to the University of Southern California was once known as a stickler for the rules.Now, Donna Heinel, the university’s former athletic department administrator, is accused of being at the fulcrum of the nationwide scandal, conspiring with a private admissions consultant to obtain millions in bribes and then easing two dozen students into U.S.C. on bogus athletic credentials.Ms. Heinel was “as hard as it gets,” a former coach said. She meticulously combed through recruits’ files, clashing with coaches when she found flaws. Above, Ms. Heinel posing with students during a football game in 2016.One of the recruits she appeared to block from admission went to a rival university — and competed in the 2016 Olympics.Elsewhere in California, we traveled to a West Hollywood school where proctors are accused of giving test answers to students.

The world’s largest international police organization is supposed to be a force for safety and security — one that transcends national boundaries and brings together democracies and autocracies.Instead, according to records and interviews across five continents, Interpol prioritized international expansion over safeguards, meaning despots and human rights violators could potentially use the agency to arrest people based on political motivations. Above, Interpol’s headquarters in Lyon, France.A crucial part of the system is the red notice, a kind of warrant in which police officers in one country ask foreign counterparts to make an arrest. When the system works, it helps catch murderers, rapists and sexual predators who cross national borders. But it has also been used to target refugees and dissidents._____ImageCreditChristopher Lee for The New York Times8. It’s hard enough being a teenager, balancing rigorous schoolwork with social pressures that are heightened by online platforms.Imagine being one of the few black and Hispanic students at one of the country’s most selective public schools. That’s what the 29 black students — out of 3,300 — at Stuyvesant High School in New York, pictured above, experience.Sarai Pridgen, a 16-year-old sophomore, said she wasn’t surprised when she saw that only seven black students were admitted for the fall. “It was the same wave of disappointment I feel every time I look at the demographics of this school.”_____ImageCreditEzra Shaw/Getty Images9. It’s Day 2 of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament.No. 1-seeded Virginia rallied out of a deep hole to advance. It was a chance to atone for its unprecedented early exit from the 2018 N.C.A.A. tournament, when it became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16.U.C. Irvine, a 13th seed, upset No. 4 Kansas State. It was the first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in the Irvine program’s history. Above, the game between U.C.

Finally, travel changes your life.At least, that’s what Rick Steves, the PBS travel host for nearly two decades, wants you to believe. For The Times Magazine’s Voyages issue, Mr. Steves, pictured above, spoke to our writer about his desire to convert the untraveled, and his role as a sort of spiritual travel agent for America’s middle classes.Our writer asked why he doesn’t ease up on his extensive travel schedule — which occupies him for four months a year. “What would I do if I stayed home?” Mr. Steves said. “Not much. Nothing I would remember.”Have a memorable night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

She has been the target of threats, her family’s lawyer said.CreditCreditLondon Metroplitan Police/EPA, via ShutterstockBy Benjamin MuellerMarch 1, 2019LONDON — Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old Briton who married an Islamic State fighter four years ago and recently asked to be allowed to return home, has been forced to move from her place in a Syrian refugee camp with her newborn after receiving threats, her family’s lawyer said on Friday.British media outlets reported that Ms. Begum may have been moved to another refugee camp closer to the border with Iraq. But in a phone call on Friday afternoon, the lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said: “We don’t know where she has been moved to. We don’t know if it’s within the camp or to another one.”The new development adds to the uncertainty surrounding a case that has split opinion in Britain. Some Britons have said that Ms. Begum was so young when she left to join the extremists that she deserves a chance at rehabilitation. Others have called for her never to be allowed back in Britain again.The British newspaper The Sun was the first to report the threats against Ms. Begum in Al Hawl refugee camp in northeastern Syria, where she fled to several weeks ago from the last remaining village held by the Islamic State in Syria.She later told a reporter that she wanted to return home to East London. Since then, she has been in limbo.The British government told her family it intended to revoke her citizenship, a move that appeared to rest on shaky legal footing and drew condemnation from some Labour and Conservative members of Parliament.Anger at Ms. Begum has run so deep in some quarters that a shooting range in northwestern England offered targets with her superimposed image. In a statement, the shooting range said it had done it to allow people “to have some lighthearted fun.”Ms. Begum had given birth to her baby boy in Al Hawl refugee camp. She left Britain at age 15 with two classmates from the Bethnel Green neighborhood to join the Islamic State, and soon married a Dutch fighter. The Sun on Thursday quoted Mr. Akunjee as saying: “I can confirm that it is our understanding that Shamima has been moved from Al Hawl due to safety concerns around her and her baby. We further understand that indeed she and her child had been threatened by others at the Al Hawl camp.”The nature of the threats was not clear. The Sun suggested she had been threatened partly because she had been improperly veiled and had shown her face in televised interviews.“I’ve been getting death threats, and I’m only the family’s lawyer,” Mr. Akunjee said on Friday. “Imagine what she must be involved with.”He said he was working on flying to Syria to try to meet with the teenager.Ms. Begum previously said that conditions in the camp were difficult but “O.K.,” and that they were certainly better than in Baghuz, the village from where Ms. Begum and thousands of others have fled in recent weeks.Baghuz is the last speck of land under Islamic State control in Iraq and Syria.(President Trump said on Thursday that the village had been captured, but reports from the battlefront suggested that was not the case.)“I get fed and I have a heater, but it’s kind of difficult going around doing stuff yourself, especially now I have a child,” Ms. Begum said of Al Hawl. She said that caring for her child was a strain without money, but added: “I’m not starving. I have a roof over my head, whereas before I was sleeping outside.”Ms. Begum’s family has said it is considering ways of challenging the British government’s decision to try to revoke her citizenship. The government’s decision apparently rested on its belief that she could claim Bangladeshi citizenship because her mother has a Bangladeshi passport.But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh has said she would not be allowed into the country and that she had been “erroneously identified” as a Bangladeshi national.Some members of Parliament from both the Labour and Conservative parties have been sharply critical of the home secretary, Sajid Javid, for trying to rescind her citizenship, saying that she had become radicalized in Britain and should be allowed to return home to face any consequences.Ms. Begum has said that she does not regret going to Syria, but that she did little more in the country than take care of her husband and children.She has said that she lost two children — an 8-month-old son and a daughter who was nearly 2 — to illness and malnutrition in the months before she fled Islamic State territory.Follow Benjamin Mueller on Twitter: @benjmueller.Yonette Joseph contributed reporting.

It was timely coursework: A year earlier, Britons had voted to leave the European Union.But Ms. Spirit was growing alarmed at the omission of young people from the Brexit debate. Despite warnings in her readings about the risks of referendums, she delayed school and founded a group with other students to push for another public vote on Brexit.They called it Our Future, Our Choice, and on Saturday it will be among a clutch of youth groups helping to lead an expected crowd of hundreds of thousands in a march on Parliament in support of a second referendum.“We were sort of horrified that there hadn’t been a youth group that was a voice on the issue of Brexit,” Ms. Spirit, 22, said. “It will be my generation, of course, who will be making sense of this and dealing with the consequences of the decision we took in 2016.”The fight for another public vote on Brexit, while still marginal among members of Parliament, has gained momentum among Britons, none more so than the young people steeling themselves for a lifetime of arguing about Europe.They look around and see a bleak political landscape: Parliament is deadlocked; Prime Minister Theresa May is still pushing her unloved Brexit plan, even though it has been rejected by her putative allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland; and the frightening prospect of a calamitous no-deal Brexit seems to be gaining more credibility every day.ImageA protester against Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union shouting in a demonstration in March outside Parliament in London.CreditTim Ireland/Associated PressBut the way many young people see it, the political chaos and dysfunction are working in their favor, with the anti-Brexit forces gaining momentum.By Friday, for example, more than four million people had put their names by Friday on a petition to revoke Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the European Union, and those numbers were growing.As Saturday’s march approached, students in Bath and Bristol bought seats on a chartered train to London. Others are coming on buses. And in student union buildings across the country, young people this week were gathering to paint banners and persuade their classmates to join them.Brexit has molded their politics as decisively as the Iraq War did an older generation’s. Worried about a chaotic British exit without an agreement with the European Union, students said they view a second referendum as the only way out of the current impasse and a crucial step to protect gains on climate change and workers’ rights.“It’s awoken a group of people who otherwise might not have been engaged,” said Sally Patterson, 23, an officer at the University of Bristol Students’ Union. “If you have a mate from Greece who might not be able to continue studying next year, you’ve got a stake in their future.”The timing of the march — only six days before the original date of Britain’s departure from the European Union — once seemed risky. Surely, it seemed, politicians would have settled the matter by then.James McGrory, the executive director of People’s Vote, the umbrella group that is organizing the march on Parliament, said the group’s leaders were originally dubious about pouring money and energy into a rally in late March. But younger organizers prevailed on them to hold it anyway.ImageA march in London last year that called for a so-called People’s Vote on whether to leave the European Union.CreditNiklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“It was me and senior colleagues who hemmed and hawed, ‘Should we do one or not?’” Mr. McGrory said. “The two things young people in the campaign said were, ‘You should have the courage of your convictions — do it.’ The other thing is they thought we could raise the money online to pay for it.”The chances of a second referendum remain small. Labour Party leaders, who have long dithered over a second referendum, have never energetically backed the idea.The most likely form it would take is a choice between the prime minister’s exit deal and remaining in the European Union. Many polls show that Britons have now gone from mostly thinking Britain was right to leave Europe after the 2016 referendum to mostly thinking the opposite.And support for a public vote has grown, according to a mid-March poll by YouGov, with the option of staying in Europe favored over Mrs. May’s divorce deal or a no-deal exit.With a following of hundreds of thousands of people on social media and email lists, Ms. Spirit’s group has invited young people to Parliament to petition their representatives and arranged for members of Parliament to visit schools to speak about Brexit. The group’s leaders have won big audiences on Twitter by posting video of encounters with pro-Brexit voters.Along the way they have become valuable voices for an anti-Brexit movement that in 2016 was harmed by its association with the political class. (It was the Conservative prime minister at the time, David Cameron, who led the Remain campaign.)“It’s more enjoyable to be the insurgents than the incumbents,” said Mr. McGrory, who is himself a veteran of the 2016 Remain campaign.ImageAnti-Brexit demonstrators outside Westminster in London calling for a second vote by the public on whether to withdraw from the European Union.CreditAlastair Grant/Associated PressAt Edge Hill University in northwest England, several dozen students were painting banners on Thursday in the students’ union bar. Among the anti-Brexit slogans: “Pulling Out Never Works.”“It feels like an antithesis to the kind of bland politicians and political elite that are pushing Brexit,” Luke Myer, 24, vice president of the students’ union, said. “It’s real, and it’s irreverent as well. We like our memes and dumb slogans.”Students said the atmosphere on campuses had seemed relatively dull in 2016, when the pro-Europe campaign stressed the potential economic problems if Britain left. Now, students are agitating about access to study abroad programs, research funding from Europe and the rights of their European classmates, said Shakira Martin, the president of the National Union of Students.Many students, too young to vote in 2016, argue that so much time has passed since the first referendum that they deserve a fresh vote. In 2016, a majority of older voters favored leaving, while most younger voters wanted to remain. Demographic changes since then might alter the results of a second referendum, with more young people reaching voting age, students say.However sparse the support for a second referendum in Parliament, the campaigners may succeed in laying the groundwork for fights in the months and years ahead for a closer relationship with Europe, said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester.Just as the Labour government of Tony Blair was blamed for Britain entering the Iraq War, he said, it will be Mrs. May’s government that will bear the stain from Brexit.“If you’re a student, the whole first 10 years of your working life are likely to be impacted to a greater or lesser extent by this Brexit debate,” Mr. Ford said. “It’ll be seen as something Conservatives initiated and presided over.”Palko Karasz contributed reporting.

Mrs. May plans to hold a third vote on her unpopular plan for withdrawal, despite have suffered two staggering defeats on it already.If the prime minister should succeed in a third attempt, she would then request a short delay — no more than three months — from European Union leaders. That presumably would be agreed to next week at a European Union summit in Brussels.But the motion noted that should her plan go down to defeat once again, Mrs. May might have to ask European leaders for a much longer delay, with unknown consequences.ImageTheresa May, the British prime minister, won a rare victory in Parliament.CreditBen Stansall/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty ImagesThe votes on Thursday were a relief for Mrs. May, whose control over the withdrawal process, or Brexit, has melted away in recent days, culminating in open defiance from members of her own cabinet in a vote on Wednesday rejecting a “no-deal” Brexit.It had long seemed possible that a cross-party consensus for a softer Brexit existed within the House of Commons, but that proved not to be the case.Some analysts said that was no great surprise.“Ultimately, these are people who have spent their careers competing against the people they now have to work with to get things passed,” said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. “They’re Labour and Tory first, and ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ second.“These are people who have spent their whole lives working for one tribe,” Mr. Ford added, “and the other tribe is the baddies. The other tribe is the people they went into politics to overcome. There’s a lot there to overcome, psychologically and historically.”And so lawmakers could not quite bring themselves to allow the body to test whether a majority would support a softer Brexit than Mrs. May has offered. That would mean leaving the European Union but remaining in a customs union with the bloc, or keeping even closer ties, minimizing the economic dislocation.Instead, Parliament has effectively given Mrs. May another chance to press ahead with her withdrawal agreement, most likely next Tuesday.Mrs. May and her allies are again working to win over 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and a bigger group of pro-Brexit hard-liners in her own Conservative Party.ImageBritons remain deeply divided over Brexit. Some made their beliefs clear in demonstrations outside Parliament on Wednesday.CreditTim Ireland/Associated PressThe amendments came at the end of a week that has been dismal for Mrs. May.On Tuesday, Parliament rejected her plan for a second time, by a vote of 391 to 242. Then, on Wednesday, Parliament voted 312 to 308 for an amendment ruling out a disorderly no-deal Brexit, badly undercutting Mrs. May’s authority and negotiating leverage.Four amendments were tabled on Thursday, each wresting a degree of control away from Mrs. May.The amendment to take control of the process failed by 314 votes to 312. Oliver Letwin, a Conservative Party lawmaker who co-sponsored the measure, calling for nonbinding votes, told the government he and his colleagues had entered into rebellion reluctantly.“None of us who has put this forward prefer to grab the order paper,” he said, addressing one of Mrs. May’s top lieutenants in debate at the House of Commons. “None of us prefer these elaborate devices. We seek above all, and only, to ensure that the House has the opportunity to rescue our fellow citizens from a fate that both he and I wish to avoid.”Sarah Wollaston, an independent lawmaker, whose amendment supporting a second referendum failed by 334 to 85, used her medical background to argue that, “if we talk about this in strictly clinical terms,” the popular consent for Brexit had expired.“Nobody would seriously proceed on the basis of a consent form that was signed nearly three years ago,” she said. “And furthermore, for young people in this country, they face being wheeled into the operating theater for major constitutional, social and economic surgery based on a consent form that was signed by their grandparents three years ago.”Delaying Brexit can happen only with the consent of the European Union, and up until now the bloc’s position has seemed clear: Only a general election or a second Brexit referendum would justify letting Britain postpone its departure by more than a few months.But on Thursday, there were signs of flexibility when Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said European leaders should be “open to a long extension” of Britain’s membership.ImageThe European Commission headquarters in Brussels.CreditFrancisco Seco/Associated PressThe comments will give weight to Mrs. May’s threat to pro-Brexit politicians that unless they back her deal in a third vote next week, they will face a long delay. That could increase the prospects of a second referendum — and that could mean that Brexit might never happen.Already some pro-Brexit rebels have folded, including David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary in protest over Mrs. May’s deal, but who voted to support it on Tuesday.Though some of the hard-liners are likely to cave in, it is unlikely that all of them will. Some believe Mrs. May’s days are numbered and are sure that her successor will be a Brexit enthusiast, perhaps Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary.Were he or someone like him in charge, they would have little to fear from a long extension of the Brexit process, some argue.One pro-Brexit legal expert, Martin Howe, argued recently in an article on the Conservative Home website, that Britain would be “much better off than under the deal” negotiated by Mrs. May. At the end of the extension, he said, Britain would be “free to leave on 1 January 2021 without being trapped in the ‘backstop’ protocol” involving the Irish border.The question then would be how many Brexit supporters would hold out against Mrs. May’s deal, and whether she could attract enough sympathizers from the opposition Labour Party to squeak her plan through.At the end of the voting on Thursday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who had ordered his lawmakers to abstain on the Wollaston amendment, stood up and called for a second vote on Brexit. That earned him a cacophony of catcalls for his head spinning about-face.Benjamin Mueller contributed reporting from London.

We went to Northern Ireland, where residents worry that the free flow of goods and people could end once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.By Stephen CastleMarch 12, 2019LONDON — Britain hurtled into unknown political territory on Tuesday when Parliament, for the second time, rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to quit the European Union, leaving her authority in tatters and the country seemingly rudderless just 17 days before its scheduled departure from the bloc.Mrs. May had hoped that last-minute concessions from the European Union would swing the vote in her favor, but many lawmakers dismissed those changes as ineffectual or cosmetic and voted against the deal, 391 to 242.After the vote, the prime minister defended her agreement as the “best outcome” for the United Kingdom and showed her frustration in addressing the lawmakers, who are scheduled to vote later this week on whether to seek an extension to leave the bloc.“Let me be clear that voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face,” Mrs. May said. “The E.U. will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension, and the House will have to answer that question.”Did Parliament want to remain in the European Union, she asked, or hold a second referendum? Or leave with some other deal?“These are unenviable choices,” she said, “but thanks to the decision the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”The deal that Parliament rejected would have eventually given Britain power over immigration from Europe, but kept the country in the European Union’s customs and trade system until at least the end of 2020.Tuesday’s vote, while expected, deepened an already profound crisis over the biggest peacetime decision to confront a British government in decades.[On Wednesday, lawmakers rejected a “no-deal” Brexit, although the next steps weren’t clear.]Mrs. May, who was forced to argue for her plan in a croaking voice because of a head cold, has essentially ceded control of events to Parliament, at least for now, with important votes coming on whether to bar a no-deal Brexit and whether to request the extension, something many analysts say is now inevitable.ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in Strasbourg, France, on Monday.CreditVincent Kessler/Reuters[Read about how Theresa May found herself without a friend, but defiant, after her latest defeat.]In another admission of her weakness, Mrs. May said after the vote that she would allow Conservative lawmakers to vote as they saw fit, without a party directive, on a no-deal Brexit.The defeat threatens Mrs. May’s hold on her office. Under party rules she cannot be challenged for the leadership by Tory lawmakers until December. But there is always the risk of a cabinet coup if she mishandles the next steps.“The thing about this drama is that it is both chronic and acute,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “It has been going on for months, we have had so many near-death experiences, and I can’t remember a time when so much has happened for so long and the tension has been so heightened.”Mrs. May now faces a number of possible options, none of them particularly palatable. She might still try one last time to force her deal through, perhaps at the very end of the month, but until then she will face pressure to change course.Some lawmakers want to take nonbinding votes on various alternatives to Mrs. May’s Brexit plans, like those that would keep closer economic ties to the bloc, similar to those enjoyed by Norway.There is discussion about a second referendum to confirm public support for a Brexit deal as against remaining in the European Union. The opposition Labour Party now says it would potentially support some form of plebiscite.But Mrs. May has been implacably opposed to a second vote, saying it would not solve the problem.More realistically, there is speculation about the possibility of a general election to change the composition of a logjammed Parliament. Though he was skeptical about that possibility, Mr. Bale said it could not be discounted completely, particularly since opinion polls show the Conservatives with a comfortable lead over Labour.“If Theresa May really has not got anything left in the locker, and the E.U. doesn’t seem willing to give her a second chance, you could see why some members of Parliament — seeing the Conservatives have opened up a lead against Labour — might think: ‘O.K., this is a do-or-die moment.’”The Conservatives had a healthy lead on Labour in 2017, which is why Mrs. May called the snap election that turned out so disastrously with the loss of her Parliamentary majority.In theory, if there is no agreement by March 29, Britain will depart the European Union without any formal deal. But Britain is ill-prepared for a disorderly and potentially chaotic exit, and lawmakers are so alarmed at that prospect that they voted in January against such an outcome in a nonbinding motion. Parliament will get that chance again in a binding vote on Wednesday.ImageProtesters on both sides of the Brexit debate outside in London on Tuesday.CreditMatt Dunham/Associated PressYet, while a clear majority opposes a no-deal Brexit, a small number of hard-liners still believe they can extract more concessions from Brussels by threatening that very outcome, which could damage continental economies.So Parliament remains stuck, largely as it has been for almost two years. The difference is that now there is very little time to chart a new path.While Parliament is expected to support an extension in the Brexit negotiations, the question will be for how long and to what purpose. All European Union leaders would have to agree to extra time for Brexit and, when they meet on March 21, they will want to know the reasoning behind any request.On Monday Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, argued that, in any event, Brexit should occur before May 23, the day of elections to the European Parliament.For legal reasons, any extension beyond this date might require Britain to take part in that contest, he suggested. That is something most British politicians do not want to contemplate.Tuesday began with some mild optimism from Mrs. May’s allies after last-minute concessions with the European Union were agreed to Monday night in Strasbourg, France. Pro-Brexit lawmakers offered a cautious initial response and promised to study the details overnight.But the mood darkened when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said Tuesday morning the last-minute pledges from the bloc did not fundamentally alter the legal status of one aspect of the agreement that pro-Brexit lawmakers find particularly objectionable.As Mr. Cox’s opinion reverberated among British politicians, Mrs. May received another damaging loss when legal analysts for the influential European Research Group, consisting of Conservative, pro-Brexit lawmakers, said they would “not recommend accepting the government’s motion today.”Then 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, whose support allowed Mrs. May to form a government, also announced their opposition to her plan.In explaining his decision, Mr. Cox said the concessions from the bloc did “reduce the risk” of Britain being trapped indefinitely in the so-called Irish backstop. That is an insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland that is a central issue for opponents of Mrs. May’s deal because they think it could trap Britain inside the European Union’s economic rule book.But Mr. Cox concluded Britain would have “no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement,” he said.Follow Stephen Castle on Twitter: @_StephenCastle.

Mueller III, requested for the fifth time on Friday a delay in the sentencing of Mr. Gates, a longtime political consultant who served as the campaign’s deputy and was indicted in a scheme related to work he did for a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine.Mr. Gates “continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations,” Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors said in a joint status report.Because the special counsel’s office cited other, unspecified inquiries, it was difficult to tell whether the petition for a delay in sentencing gave any indication of when its broader investigation into Russia’s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates would be complete, a subject of intense speculation.The request capped a brief flurry of activity by the special counsel’s prosecutors.They wrapped up their most high-profile prosecution on Wednesday, when Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, was sentenced to a total of seven and a half years in prison for financial crimes and lying to prosecutors and a grand jury.Mr. Manafort was Mr. Gates’s former mentor and business partner. Facing up to six years in prison, Mr. Gates agreed to cooperate with the special counsel and testified against Mr. Manafort.With Mr. Manafort’s sentencing finished, the special counsel team appeared to be closing its Manafort chapter.
One of the office’s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, who helped lead the cases against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, plans to leave his detail soon, a spokesman said.Lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, requested this week that his sentencing be delayed. In a court filing, Mr. Mueller said that Mr. Flynn continued to be positioned to cooperate with law enforcement officials in a case in Virginia.Mr. Flynn
agreed in December 2017 to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, who has charged 34 people in his nearly two-year investigation.As the special counsel’s inquiry has loomed over his presidency, Mr. Trump has labeled the investigation fake, rigged and a witch hunt.On Friday, after offering condolences on Twitter for the mosque attacks in New Zealand that killed 49 people, Mr. Trump returned to criticizing the inquiry, calling it “an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime.”“THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!” he added.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsSpecial Counsel Sought Michael Cohen’s Emails in 2017, Documents Show - The New York Times

Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, in early March.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Benjamin Weiser and William K. RashbaumMarch 19, 2019Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, beginning in July 2017, according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president.The documents show that by the time F.B.I. agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr. Cohen’s home and office in April of last year, his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation. The records, including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid, were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations.The records were heavily redacted. More than 150 pages were fully blacked out, and many had names or portions of the material obscured, mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization.Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, said in a statement on Monday night that the disclosures would only further Mr. Cohen’s “interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress.”One newly released search warrant said the F.B.I. and Manhattan federal prosecutors were investigating Mr. Cohen for a range of crimes, including defrauding several banks dating back to 2016 and a scheme “to make an illegal campaign contribution in October 2016 to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.” The warrant also indicated they were investigating him for wire fraud and conspiracy.Another search warrant showed that prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, were investigating Mr. Cohen for other crimes growing out of the Russia inquiry, including failure to register as a foreign agent and money laundering.The documents give a rough timeline of how the Cohen investigation unfolded. Starting in July 2017, two months after Mr. Mueller’s appointment, and stretching through November, his office obtained three search warrants for Mr. Cohen’s emails and another for his iCloud account from a federal judge in Washington.The timing of the warrants, which can take weeks if not longer to obtain, indicates that the investigation started even earlier.By February 2018, Mr. Mueller’s office had referred aspects of that investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. F.B.I. agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and home in New York two months later.Later in the year, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in two separate cases. In the first, he admitted to committing campaign finance violations by arranging hush money payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, as well as financial crimes, in a case brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In the second, he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in a case brought by Mr. Mueller’s office.Mr. Cohen, 52, apologized at his sentencing in December, blaming himself for “my own weakness and a blind loyalty” to Mr. Trump that he said had led him “to choose a path of darkness over light.”Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Mr. Cohen to three years in prison; he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on May 6 after Judge Pauley granted him a two-month delay because of pending shoulder surgery and his need to prepare for testimony before three congressional committees.Mr. Cohen testified on Feb. 27 in a daylong public hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he described as Mr. Trump’s lies about his business interests in Russia and his role in the payment of hush money to one of the women, Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress. In his testimony, Mr. Cohen called the president a racist, a con man and a cheat.The newly public documents also show how little the public knew about the Russian investigation in real time as prosecutors zeroed in on Mr. Cohen.Prosecutors, for instance, unearthed bank payments from a New York investment firm tied to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin who met with Mr. Cohen in his Trump Tower office just days before the inauguration, the documents show.The public did not learn of those payments, or that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors later interviewed Mr. Vekselberg, until almost a year later.The search materials were made public at the order of Judge Pauley. Last fall, when The New York Times and other news organizations asked the judge to unseal the materials, the government opposed such action.Prosecutors cited the “need to protect an ongoing law enforcement investigation” and the privacy of “numerous uncharged third parties.”Judge Pauley ultimately ordered the government to provide him with a copy of the sealed materials and its proposed redactions. On Monday, after saying he had reviewed and approved the redactions, he ordered the government to file the redacted copy on the public court docket.The judge also said he would revisit the documents’ secrecy in the near future, directing prosecutors to provide him with a confidential update by May 15.Follow Benjamin Weiser and William Rashbaum on Twitter: @BenWeiserNYT @WRashbaumAdam Goldman and Benjamin Protess contributed reporting.

In recent years, migrants came to attend universities, open restaurants or to escape wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.It felt as if everyone knew everyone. Mosques were not for Pakistanis or Somalis or Bangladeshis, but for anyone in town.So when a gunman stormed two mosques in the city of Christchurch during Friday Prayer, killing 49 people, the news moved quickly through New Zealand’s nearly 50,000 Muslims and the wider Islamic world.[Follow our live briefing here.]Throughout the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, families frantically sought visas so they could race to the bed sides of the injured. And they tried to get someone in New Zealand to answer their calls.“Nobody’s answering their phones,” said Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, which is based in Auckland, an 85-minute flight from Christchurch.“We don’t know if they’re at the hospital or out of reach,” she said. “Some have posted that they are safe, but others have not.”She said one set of parents was waiting to hear from their son.“They were supposed to have lunch with him after prayers,” she said.Muslim leaders in New Zealand said mosques across the country, including the two that were attacked, tended to attract a multiethnic group of worshipers. Early reports suggested that those injured and killed reflected these diverse congregations.Among the dozens recorded as missing were people from Egypt, Syria, India, Kuwait, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia, according to a site managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.Reports filtered in from ethnic and national groups across the globe.At least one Palestinian was killed and several others injured, according to the Palestine Liberation Organization’s ambassador to Australia and New Zealand. Two Malaysians were being treated for injuries, Malaysian officials said, and nine people of Indian nationality or origin were missing,
the Indian government said on Twitter.VideoFifty people were killed in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday. Officials said a 28-year-old man had been charged with murder.CreditCreditMatthew Abbott for The New York TimesAn official from Syrian Solidarity New Zealand told a local news outlet that a father was among those killed, and one family had a child missing and another in serious condition in the hospital. “They escaped death and torture in Syria, to come to New Zealand, and be killed here,” the official, Ali Akil, said.Local news reports in Hyderabad, India, identified one of those shot as Ahmed Jehangir, who had lived for 12 years in New Zealand, where he owns a restaurant.His brother told The News Minute, an Indian news site, that two of Mr. Jehangir’s friends were killed and that he was “struggling for his life.”Mr. Jehangir’s family, hoping to help Mr. Jehangir’s wife and two small children, were trying to get to New Zealand as quickly as possible, the article said.Another family in Hyderabad was waiting to hear about Farhaj Ashan, who, according to The News Minute,
had last been heard from before leaving for Al Noor Mosque, one of the two where the attacks took place.A software engineer living in Christchurch with his wife, 3-year-old daughter and 6-month-old son, Mr. Ashan had gone to New Zealand for a master’s degree at the University of Auckland in 2010, and stayed, the news site reported.“Everyone has come back, but not my son,” Mr. Ashan’s father, Mohammad Sayeeduddin, 68, told The News Minute.The Pakistan Association of New Zealand circulated on its Facebook page a form to be used by people looking for loved ones, asking for details like eye color and any distinguishing birthmarks or scars. The group listed six members of the Pakistani community it said were missing.Muslim leaders across New Zealand stressed that the attacks were out of character for the country.“Muslims have been in New Zealand for a long time, and Muslims have never had any issues in New Zealand,” said Ibrar Sheikh, the secretary of Al Mustafa Jamia Masjid, a mosque in Auckland.“Just because one or two individuals have taken this stand, it doesn’t mean there is an attack on people living in New Zealand,” he said.He added that the mosques attacked in Christchurch were, like most in New Zealand, “a United Nations” of ethnicities.ImageA mosque in Auckland. The attacks in Christchurch have drawn a tightly knit community even closer together.CreditPhil Walter/Getty ImagesThe first Muslims to arrive in the country were members of a British-Indian family who landed in Christchurch in 1854.Larger-scale Muslim immigration began in the 1970s, with the arrival of families and students from the Pacific islands. The region of Canterbury, which includes Christchurch, has been an area of steady growth.Abdullah Drury, a scholar who completed a history of Muslim migration in New Zealand two years ago, said the Muslim population in Canterbury grew enough that by 1977, a formal association could be registered and organized.The group set up the first Muslim place of prayer on New Zealand’s South Island in Christchurch three years later.Muslim immigration accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s with arrivals from war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.The 2013 census counted a national population of more than 4.2 million people, including more than 46,000 people who identified as Muslim, up nearly 30 percent from 2006.Research shows that the majority of Muslims in New Zealand are Sunni, with a large Shia minority and some Ahmadi Muslims.Now, said Ms. Hanif of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, a close community must become even closer: Both mosques that were attacked on Friday had already reached out to ask for help with funeral arrangements.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand noted that many of the victims were immigrants.“For many this may not have been the place they were born,” she said. “For many, New Zealand was their choice, the place that they chose to come to and committed themselves to, the place they chose to raise their families.”Ms. Ardern said New Zealand was a haven from hatred, racism or extremism, and that is why it had become a target.“We were chosen for the very fact that we are none of these things,” she said. “Because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it. Those values will not and cannot be shaken by this attack.”Charlotte Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand; Damien Cave from Sydney, Australia; and Benjamin Mueller from London.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|The Daintiest Slap on Paul Manafort’s WristAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe Daintiest Slap on Paul Manafort’s WristManafort sought judicial compassion. On Thursday, he got it.By Cristian FariasMr. Farias is a member of the editorial board.March 8, 2019ImageCreditCreditVictor J. Blue/BloombergJudge T.S. Ellis III on Thursday gave Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, a notably light prison sentence of less than four years, confounding experts and those who practice regularly in the federal courts.Mr. Manafort, convicted last summer on charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and related criminality uncovered by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, faced 19 to 24 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.The leniency shown by Judge Ellis,
of the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., toward Mr. Manafort carries the whiff of miscarriage of justice, especially given how the criminal justice system routinely treats people without Mr. Manafort’s wealth, influence or skin color. No two sentences are alike — in the federal system and in the states, judges retain wide discretion to sentence defendants or could be hand-tied in the sentences they impose. But if the failed war on drugs and the era of mass incarceration have taught us anything, it is that there are two tracks of justice: one for those who can afford expensive defense counsel and who can move heaven and earth to receive mercy, and one for everyone else. People like Mr. Manafort, when caught cheating taxpayers of millions of dollars, receive discretion and kid-glove treatment, while drug dealers and less sophisticated defendants — in Judge Ellis’s courtroom and elsewhere — are subject to draconian mandatory minimum sentences. Perhaps Judge Ellis, a veteran of the federal bench who was appointed by Ronald Reagan, bought the argument that Mr. Manafort was being targeted to ratchet up the pressure on others as part of the broader inquiry into Russia’s actions in the 2016 presidential campaign, as his lawyers put it to Judge Ellis ahead of sentencing.During a revealing moment early in Thursday’s hearing, Judge Ellis said Mr. Manafort was “not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election.” This is true. But collusion, as Judge Ellis surely knows, is not a federal crime, and it is not mentioned in the appointment order that gave Mr. Mueller his mandate in May 2017. Rather, it’s a term of art that Mr. Trump and his defenders have abused to misdirect the public about the true nature of the special counsel investigation. Mr. Mueller, perhaps wisely, declined to make a specific sentencing recommendation for Mr. Manafort. But his office pulled no punches in laying out Mr. Manafort’s pattern of criminal conduct, his lack of remorse and his post-indictment behavior — all resulting in a revocation of his bail, new charges of obstruction of justice and the implosion of his plea agreement in a separate case, in Washington, D.C., for lying to prosecutors and the grand jury. (Mr. Manafort, who has admitted in that case to sharing polling data during the campaign with a Russian associate believed to have intelligence ties, will be sentenced in that case next week.)“Manafort’s criminal conduct was serious, longstanding, and bold,” Mr. Mueller’s team told Judge Ellis in a sentencing submission filed last month. “He failed to pay taxes in five successive years involving more than $16 million in unreported income — and failed to identify his overseas accounts in those same returns — resulting in more than $6 million in unpaid taxes.”To federal prosecutors, Mr. Manafort “benefited from the protections and privileges of the law and the services of his government, while cheating it and his fellow citizens.”That didn’t seem to matter much to Judge Ellis, who indicated in court on Thursday that Mr. Manafort led “an otherwise blameless life.” Did the judge read a word of Mr. Mueller’s sentencing memorandum and his later written rebuttal, in which lawyers for the special counsel chided Mr. Manafort’s halfhearted cooperation with prosecutors, his claim that he’s too old and frail to reoffend, and the lack of clarity that remains about his assets and ability to make taxpayers whole?“Manafort’s effort to shift the blame to others — as he did at trial — is not consistent with acceptance of responsibility or a mitigating factor,” prosecutors wrote. Amid the furor, including from former judges, over Judge Ellis’s apparent lack of impartiality during the Manafort trial last year, I was among those who gave him the benefit of the doubt. Judges often play hardball with prosecutors and defense lawyers, my thinking went, and Judge Ellis had already recognized, in declining to toss out Mr. Mueller’s indictment against Mr. Manafort ahead of trial, that the charges “clearly arise out of the special counsel’s investigation into the payments defendant allegedly received from Russian-backed leaders and pro-Russian political officials.”Mr. Manafort has shown no contrition for his misdeeds, or for his recalcitrance since the special counsel first charged him. And Judge Ellis ignored all that, doing a disservice to justice.The judge’s mercy may be the closest Mr. Manafort will get to a presidential pardon. But that may not keep him from begging for one. Mr. Trump, who has praised Mr. Manafort as a “brave man” and lamented that his own Justice Department had charged Mr. Manafort with tax crimes that were only peripheral to the Russia investigation, has refused to rule it out.RelatedMore on Paul ManafortWas Paul Manafort’s Sentence Too Light?March 8, 2019Manafort’s 47 Months: A Sentence That Drew Gasps From Around the CountryMarch 8, 2019Opinion | The Editorial BoardMueller Guides Us Through the SwampApril 22, 2018Opinion | The Editorial BoardWelcome to the President’s Rat Pack, Paul ManafortSept. 14, 2018The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Stone Jr. faced questions on Monday over the publication of a book and new Instagram posts that may have violated a gag order prohibiting him from making public statements about the legal proceedings against him.The office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, notified a federal judge about an Instagram post that Mr. Stone posted on Sunday mimicking a poster of the 1988 film “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” Under a portrait of himself he asked the question, “Who Framed Roger Stone?”The post came two days after the judge, Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered Mr. Stone to explain why he did not tell her he was publishing a book that provides a defense for himself barely a week after she issued a gag order prohibiting him from making public statements about the criminal case against him.She was referring to a new edition of Mr. Stone’s book “The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Donald Trump REALLY Won” that was published on Friday.Mr. Stone filed a response on late Monday afternoon, arguing that the book had not violated the gag order because the parts about the case had been published online in January, before the judge signed the order on Feb. 21.The judge’s latest order came eight days after she reprimanded Mr. Stone for posting a picture on Instagram that appeared to show Judge Jackson next to rifle-scope cross hairs. She threatened to send him to jail without bail if he violated the gag order.She extended the order to “posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other form of social media.”VideoRoger J.

Stone Jr.’s criminal case issued an order rebuking him on Tuesday for failing to inform her sooner about a new introduction to his book that may violate a gag order because it includes criticism of the current special counsel investigation.After the judge, Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court in Washington, raised the issue last Friday in a court filing, Mr. Stone asked the judge to consider the new edition of his book an exception to the gag order, which prohibits Mr. Stone from speaking publicly about the legal proceedings against him.Mr. Stone’s defense team has argued that the new introduction, dated January 2019, was written and printed by the publisher before the gag order was put in place on Feb. 21. Mr. Stone said in an Instagram post that the book would be “in stores March 1.”But in Tuesday’s order, Judge Jackson rejected Mr. Stone’s request for her to clarify whether the book falls under the gag order, writing that Mr. Stone had several opportunities to inform the court about the publication of the new edition and that he had failed to do so.“It does not matter when the defendant may have first formulated the opinions expressed, or when he first put them into words: He may no longer share his views on these particular subjects with the world,” Judge Jackson wrote.Mr. Stone and his lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. Stone, a former campaign adviser and longtime friend of President Trump, faces charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing justice related to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Stone was also under scrutiny on Monday for two Instagram posts on Sunday, including one that mimicked a poster for the 1988 film “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” Under a portrait of himself, he asked the question, “Who Framed Roger Stone?” Mr. Mueller’s office had notified Judge Jackson about the Roger Rabbit post because it potentially violated the gag order.Judge Jackson also ordered Mr. Stone on Tuesday to provide detailed records of communications with the publisher of the book, called “The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Donald Trump REALLY Won.”She asked for detailed documentation of when the book was scheduled to be available in stores and for online sale, citing inconsistencies in the defense team’s accounts of the publishing dates.Judge Jackson wrote that the defense team had previously referred to the “imminent” rerelease of the book’s contents. Then, on Monday, Mr. Stone’s defense team said the phrase “imminent general release” was a “misnomer” because the book was already for sale. They wrote that the new edition of the book was uploaded to the printer on Jan. 17 and that copies were available at bookstores “on or before the publication date” of Feb. 19.Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Stone “deliberately waited until public sales were not only ‘imminent,’ but, apparently, ongoing, to inform the Court of the publication effort that had been underway for weeks.”Mr. Stone first got into trouble with Judge Jackson after he posted a since-deleted photo on Instagram on Feb. 18 that appeared to show her next to rifle-scope cross hairs. Because Mr. Stone used his Instagram account in an “incendiary and threatening manner,” Judge Jackson wrote in Tuesday’s order, any consequences stemming from that choice are his to own.“The fact that the order exists at all is entirely the fault of the defendant,” she wrote in reference to the Feb. 21 gag order.In a new introduction to his book, Mr. Stone said that Mr. Mueller had “tried to implicate” him by saying he knew about WikiLeaks’ plans to release information that would damage Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency.“There is no evidence whatsoever to support this claim,” he wrote, “even after at least 12 of my current and former associates have been browbeaten by the F.B.I. and at least six of them were dragged before Mueller’s grand jury.” Follow Julia Jacobs on Twitter: @juliarebeccaj.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Stone’s Book Has Revisions That Test A Gag Order.

One of them, soon well corroborated, was that Russian intelligence was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the release of stolen emails through WikiLeaks.The next possibility was that a Russian project to cultivate Trump, supported and directed by Putin, had been going on for many years, and included both offers of “sweetener real estate business deals” (which Trump supposedly declined) and “a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin” (which he supposedly accepted).The third possibility was that this relationship dramatically influenced the 2016 campaign. According to Steele’s sources, there was possibly “a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation” between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence, managed by Paul Manafort with Michael Cohen playing go-between in Prague, which encompassed the D.N.C. hacking — a crime carried out “with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team.”The final possibility, of course, was that Russia had so-called “kompromat” on Trump — above all, the pee tape.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]Since its Buzzfeed publication in early 2017, the dossier’s prominence has varied. It’s probably cited more often in the defensive, pro-Trump press, where it’s depicted as discredited gossip that tainted the Russia investigation’s credibility from the start. But Russiagate enthusiasts and would-be honest brokers have also returned to it frequently — and for good reason, since it establishes a bar for Mueller’s investigation that, if cleared, would absolutely deserve to end Trump’s presidency.If the D.N.C. hack took place with Trump’s cooperation as part of a longstanding exchange of favors, then he would be guiltier than Nixon, having participated in a Watergate with a foreign power as the burglar. If Mueller could prove that something like that happened, impeachment would be inevitable, and resignation or removal reasonably likely.But will Mueller prove it? While retaining an official agnosticism, my sense after Cohen’s testimony is that the odds are as low as they’ve been since this whole affair started, and the increasing likelihood is that the Steele dossier was, in fact, as Trump’s defenders have long described it — a narrative primarily grounded in Russian disinformation.ImageMichael Cohen arriving to testify before a House committee on Wednesday.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesThat’s because Cohen’s testimony dovetailed with the always-more-plausible narrative in which Trump and his circle weren’t collaborators but fools and wannabes, who might have been willing to play games with spies and hackers, but who mostly just bumbled around haplessly on the sidelines.This is what you can see happening in the Trump Tower Moscow project, so far as I can tell — instead of Putin offering Trump a sweetheart deal, it seems to have involved his fixers trying to get the Russian government’s attention, to no practical end.And it’s also the sense left by Cohen’s testimony that he witnessed Trump taking a call from Roger Stone in the summer of 2016, in which Stone claimed to have just heard from Julian Assange about “a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”This happened at a time when WikiLeaks had already been hinting at an email dump, so Stone was not exactly delivering privileged information. Trump, according to Cohen, responded “to the effect of stating ‘wouldn’t that be great.’ ” This doesn’t seem like how a years-long collaboration with Russian intelligence would unfold.Meanwhile on every other Russia-related front, Cohen — with every reason to knife his former boss — offered dossier-discrediting denials. He never went to Prague to meet with Russian intelligence, as the dossier alleged, never heard anything about kompromat, and never had any direct evidence of Trumpian collusion with the Russians.Is it possible that a real conspiracy was run without the knowledge of the president’s trusted and then-proudly shady fixer? In theory, yes; it could have all happened through figures like Paul Manafort, who we know shared campaign polling data, at least, with a Russian-intelligence-linked figure. But if the dossier’s claim of a years-long Trump-Kremlin entanglement and its claim of Cohen’s direct involvement are both looking implausible or false, then its claims about a sustained Manafort-managed collaboration should be treated extremely skeptically as well.In which case the most likely l’affaire Russe endgame may be a special prosecutor’s report that doesn’t make Trump look good or decent or moral, but which implicitly exonerates him of conspiring with the Russians, and makes a lot of Mueller watchers extremely unhappy in the process.On the eve of Muellerdämmerung, that’s what this agnostic very cautiously expects.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Craig, the White House counsel under President Barack Obama, is under investigation for work he did on behalf of the president of Ukraine.CreditCreditMark Wilson/Getty ImagesBy Kenneth P. Vogel and Katie BennerMarch 18, 2019WASHINGTON — A long-running federal investigation into a former White House counsel in the Obama administration is reaching a critical stage, presenting the Justice Department with a decision about whether to charge a prominent Democrat as part of a more aggressive crackdown on illegal foreign lobbying.The case involving the lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, was transferred in January from federal prosecutors in New York to those in Washington. The previously undisclosed move was driven by Justice Department officials in Washington, and reflects an eagerness within the department to prosecute violations of lobbying laws after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, focused on foreign influence in his investigations.A decision about whether to prosecute Mr. Craig, who was White House counsel for President Barack Obama during his first year in office, is expected in the coming weeks, people familiar with the case said. The investigation centers on whether Mr. Craig should have disclosed work he did in 2012 — while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — on behalf of the Russia-aligned government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine.The work was steered to Mr. Craig by Paul Manafort, who was then a political consultant collecting millions of dollars from clients in former Soviet states. Mr. Manafort, who went on to become President Trump’s campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced this month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of banking, tax and lobbying laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.The Manafort case, and others developed by Mr. Mueller, marked the first high-profile criminal charges in years under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. The 1938 law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians.It had rarely been used in prosecutions, even as prominent Washington lobbyists, consultants, lawyers and former public officials collected ever-larger, often six- and seven-figure paydays from foreign interests looking to burnish their sometimes unsavory reputations in the United States capital.Mr. Manafort’s case, and the investigations into Mr. Craig and other high-profile consultants who worked with Mr. Manafort, have left Washington’s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling to deal with the heightened scrutiny.The Justice Department recently signaled that its enforcement efforts were just getting started, indicating that scrutiny of foreign influence in American politics will continue after Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which began with a focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.One of the first significant initiatives under the new attorney general, William P. Barr, was the reorganization of the unit that oversees FARA, suggesting that enforcing laws on foreign lobbying will become a priority of his tenure.The prosecutor brought in to run the unit, Brandon L. Van Grack, worked until recently in the special counsel’s office. The unit falls within the Justice Department’s national security division, which investigated Skadden Arps’s Ukraine work and must approve any charges against Mr. Craig.Mr. Craig, 74, would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case spinning out of the special counsel’s investigation — a distinction that could be used to rebut accusations leveled by Mr. Trump and his supporters that the investigation is a partisan witch hunt.An Ivy League-educated lawyer who moved easily between elite law firms and government for more than four decades, Mr. Craig worked on foreign policy and other issues during the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama, and joined Skadden Arps in 2010 to create a division focused on what he called “international troubleshooting.”His Democratic bona fides and ties to the Obama administration were among the main reasons he was recruited by Mr. Manafort as part of an effort to build support in Washington for Mr. Yanukovych, according to lobbyists who worked on the account. They were told to emphasize to Democratic members of Congress and the media that Mr. Craig was involved in the effort.For Skadden Arps, the work was lucrative; Mr. Manafort arranged for the firm to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch. In exchange, a team led by Mr. Craig was to produce a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych’s government of one of his rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.Mr. Craig and the other Skadden Arps lawyers who worked on the account did not register as foreign agents under FARA, despite inquiries from the Justice Department at the time about whether they should have. The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register, but it reversed itself the following year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.The issue started getting renewed scrutiny from the Justice Department in 2017 as Mr. Mueller’s team traced the flow of overseas cash to fund Mr. Manafort’s lobbying efforts. The special counsel had subpoenaed or requested documents from Skadden Arps and two lobbying firms recruited by Mr. Manafort’s team to help build support for Mr. Yanukovych’s government, and Mr. Mueller’s investigators had interviewed people who worked with all three firms, including Mr. Craig. But last year, Mr. Mueller’s team referred the matters related to the three firms to federal prosecutors in Manhattan for potential prosecution as FARA violations.ImageThe investigations into Mr. Craig and others who worked with Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, have left Washington’s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling.CreditBrian Snyder/ReutersAccording to people familiar with the case, Manhattan prosecutors have retained control of the investigations of the two lobbying firms. They are Mercury Public Affairs, whose lead partner on the account was Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress, and the Podesta Group, led by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser whose business collapsed in 2017 under the glare of Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny.The prosecutors have interviewed lobbyists who worked with Mercury and Podesta on the Ukraine account as recently as January, but people familiar with the interviews said the prosecutors provided no clues about their plans.The investigation of Mr. Craig, on the other hand, was moved in January to Washington, where the government has signaled that it is moving quickly toward a decision about an indictment, people familiar with the case said.The Justice Department’s national security division announced a settlement with Skadden Arps in January that brought even more attention to Mr. Craig. He left the firm last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.In exchange for a pledge by the Justice Department not to prosecute Skadden Arps, the firm agreed to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on Ukraine.The settlement accused Mr. Craig of working with Mr. Manafort to hide the funding from the Ukrainian oligarch for Skadden Arps’s work, and of making “false and misleading” statements to other partners at the firm and the Justice Department about his interactions with a reporter for The New York Times related to the Tymoshenko report. Those representations led the Justice Department’s FARA unit to conclude in January 2014 that Skadden Arps was not required to disclose the work under FARA, according to the settlement.In announcing the settlement, John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s national security division, said Skadden Arps’s failure to register under FARA “hid from the public that its report was part of a Ukrainian foreign influence campaign,” depriving Americans of the ability “to consider the identity of the speaker as they evaluate the substance of the speech.”Neither the settlement nor Mr. Demers named either Mr. Craig or The Times and its reporter, David E. Sanger, but their identities are clear from the context. At issue is whether Mr. Craig proactively contacted Mr. Sanger to provide and promote the report, which could fall under the public relations prong of FARA, or merely responded to inquiries from The Times and other media outlets about Skadden Arps’s analysis.William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy, lawyers for Mr. Craig, said their client “did nothing that required him to register in connection with his work on the Tymoshenko report. The Skadden settlement was done without his knowledge, and the assertion that he made intentionally false statements to the FARA unit is entirely untrue.”Mr. Craig’s allies reject the characterization that he was integrally involved in the public relations strategy surrounding the report. And they say that in his conversation with Mr. Sanger, Mr. Craig was not speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian government, but rather correcting mischaracterizations of the report as exonerating Mr. Yanukovych’s government from accusations that it prosecuted Ms. Tymoshenko for political reasons.Supporters of Mr. Craig bristled earlier this month when Mr. Demers appeared to again call out both Mr. Craig and Skadden Arps at an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans. The firm “was on the hook” for FARA violations because it “made a series of representations to the Justice Department that were not accurate” based on Mr. Craig’s misleading statements, Mr. Demers said, though he did not identify Mr. Craig by name.He said at the conference that FARA would no longer be considered “an administrative obligation” by the Justice Department, but rather would now be regarded as “an enforcement priority.”Mr. Craig’s allies contend that the case against him is inconsistent with the Justice Department’s previous interpretations of FARA.Statements made by Justice Department leaders have contributed to this view. In the summer of 2017, Adam Hickey, an official in the National Security Division, told lawmakers that FARA was designed to make foreign influence campaigns transparent, “not to discourage that conduct itself.”His description of FARA focused largely on transparency through voluntary registration and ongoing records keeping. “Although it contains a criminal penalty for certain willful conduct,” Mr. Hickey said, “the statute’s focal point is an administrative reporting regime.”A different statute, Section 951, was designed to punish and deter criminal behavior, he said.While the Justice Department would not comment on Mr. Craig’s case, a spokesman said that there is no discrepancy between Mr. Demers’s comments and Mr. Hickey’s testimony.“The purpose of enforcement is increased transparency” and “lying to the government has always been a crime,” said Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman. “That is not new, nor should it be portrayed as such.”Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and William K. Rashbaum from New York. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Manafort Case Could Ensnare Obama Figure.

Taylor III and William J. Murphy, lawyers for Mr. Craig, said their client “did nothing that required him to register in connection with his work on the Tymoshenko report. The Skadden settlement was done without his knowledge, and the assertion that he made intentionally false statements to the FARA unit is entirely untrue.”Mr. Craig’s allies reject the characterization that he was integrally involved in the public relations strategy surrounding the report. And they say that in his conversation with Mr. Sanger, Mr. Craig was not speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian government, but rather correcting mischaracterizations of the report as exonerating Mr. Yanukovych’s government from accusations that it prosecuted Ms. Tymoshenko for political reasons.Supporters of Mr. Craig bristled earlier this month when Mr. Demers appeared to again call out both Mr. Craig and Skadden Arps at an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans. The firm “was on the hook” for FARA violations because it “made a series of representations to the Justice Department that were not accurate” based on Mr. Craig’s misleading statements, Mr. Demers said, though he did not identify Mr. Craig by name.He said at the conference that FARA would no longer be considered “an administrative obligation” by the Justice Department, but rather would now be regarded as “an enforcement priority.”Mr. Craig’s allies contend that the case against him is inconsistent with the Justice Department’s previous interpretations of FARA.Statements made by Justice Department leaders have contributed to this view. In the summer of 2017, Adam Hickey, an official in the National Security Division, told lawmakers that FARA was designed to make foreign influence campaigns transparent, “not to discourage that conduct itself.”His description of FARA focused largely on transparency through voluntary registration and ongoing records keeping. “Although it contains a criminal penalty for certain willful conduct,” Mr. Hickey said, “the statute’s focal point is an administrative reporting regime.”A different statute, Section 951, was designed to punish and deter criminal behavior, he said.While the Justice Department would not comment on Mr. Craig’s case, a spokesman said that there is no discrepancy between Mr. Demers’s comments and Mr. Hickey’s testimony.“The purpose of enforcement is increased transparency” and “lying to the government has always been a crime,” said Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman. “That is not new, nor should it be portrayed as such.”Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and William K.

Craig, the White House counsel under President Barack Obama, is under investigation for work he did on behalf of the president of Ukraine.CreditCreditMark Wilson/Getty ImagesBy Kenneth P. Vogel and Katie BennerMarch 18, 2019WASHINGTON — A long-running federal investigation into a former White House counsel in the Obama administration is reaching a critical stage, presenting the Justice Department with a decision about whether to charge a prominent Democrat as part of a more aggressive crackdown on illegal foreign lobbying.The case involving the lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, was transferred in January from federal prosecutors in New York to those in Washington. The previously undisclosed move was driven by Justice Department officials in Washington, and reflects an eagerness within the department to prosecute violations of lobbying laws after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, focused on foreign influence in his investigations.A decision about whether to prosecute Mr. Craig, who was White House counsel for President Barack Obama during his first year in office, is expected in the coming weeks, people familiar with the case said. The investigation centers on whether Mr. Craig should have disclosed work he did in 2012 — while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — on behalf of the Russia-aligned government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine.The work was steered to Mr. Craig by Paul Manafort, who was then a political consultant collecting millions of dollars from clients in former Soviet states. Mr. Manafort, who went on to become President Trump’s campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced this month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of banking, tax and lobbying laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.The Manafort case, and others developed by Mr. Mueller, marked the first high-profile criminal charges in years under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. The 1938 law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians.It had rarely been used in prosecutions, even as prominent Washington lobbyists, consultants, lawyers and former public officials collected ever-larger, often six- and seven-figure paydays from foreign interests looking to burnish their sometimes unsavory reputations in the United States capital.Mr. Manafort’s case, and the investigations into Mr. Craig and other high-profile consultants who worked with Mr. Manafort, have left Washington’s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling to deal with the heightened scrutiny.The Justice Department recently signaled that its enforcement efforts were just getting started, indicating that scrutiny of foreign influence in American politics will continue after Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which began with a focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.One of the first significant initiatives under the new attorney general, William P. Barr, was the reorganization of the unit that oversees FARA, suggesting that enforcing laws on foreign lobbying will become a priority of his tenure.The prosecutor brought in to run the unit, Brandon L. Van Grack, worked until recently in the special counsel’s office. The unit falls within the Justice Department’s national security division, which investigated Skadden Arps’s Ukraine work and must approve any charges against Mr. Craig.Mr. Craig, 74, would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case spinning out of the special counsel’s investigation — a distinction that could be used to rebut accusations leveled by Mr. Trump and his supporters that the investigation is a partisan witch hunt.An Ivy League-educated lawyer who moved easily between elite law firms and government for more than four decades, Mr. Craig worked on foreign policy and other issues during the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama, and joined Skadden Arps in 2010 to create a division focused on what he called “international troubleshooting.”His Democratic bona fides and ties to the Obama administration were among the main reasons he was recruited by Mr. Manafort as part of an effort to build support in Washington for Mr. Yanukovych, according to lobbyists who worked on the account. They were told to emphasize to Democratic members of Congress and the media that Mr. Craig was involved in the effort.For Skadden Arps, the work was lucrative; Mr. Manafort arranged for the firm to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch. In exchange, a team led by Mr. Craig was to produce a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych’s government of one of his rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.Mr. Craig and the other Skadden Arps lawyers who worked on the account did not register as foreign agents under FARA, despite inquiries from the Justice Department at the time about whether they should have. The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register, but it reversed itself the following year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.The issue started getting renewed scrutiny from the Justice Department in 2017 as Mr. Mueller’s team traced the flow of overseas cash to fund Mr. Manafort’s lobbying efforts. The special counsel had subpoenaed or requested documents from Skadden Arps and two lobbying firms recruited by Mr. Manafort’s team to help build support for Mr. Yanukovych’s government, and Mr. Mueller’s investigators had interviewed people who worked with all three firms, including Mr. Craig. But last year, Mr. Mueller’s team referred the matters related to the three firms to federal prosecutors in Manhattan for potential prosecution as FARA violations.ImageThe investigations into Mr. Craig and others who worked with Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, have left Washington’s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling.CreditBrian Snyder/ReutersAccording to people familiar with the case, Manhattan prosecutors have retained control of the investigations of the two lobbying firms. They are Mercury Public Affairs, whose lead partner on the account was Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress, and the Podesta Group, led by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser whose business collapsed in 2017 under the glare of Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny.The prosecutors have interviewed lobbyists who worked with Mercury and Podesta on the Ukraine account as recently as January, but people familiar with the interviews said the prosecutors provided no clues about their plans.The investigation of Mr. Craig, on the other hand, was moved in January to Washington, where the government has signaled that it is moving quickly toward a decision about an indictment, people familiar with the case said.The Justice Department’s national security division announced a settlement with Skadden Arps in January that brought even more attention to Mr. Craig. He left the firm last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.In exchange for a pledge by the Justice Department not to prosecute Skadden Arps, the firm agreed to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on Ukraine.The settlement accused Mr. Craig of working with Mr. Manafort to hide the funding from the Ukrainian oligarch for Skadden Arps’s work, and of making “false and misleading” statements to other partners at the firm and the Justice Department about his interactions with a reporter for The New York Times related to the Tymoshenko report. Those representations led the Justice Department’s FARA unit to conclude in January 2014 that Skadden Arps was not required to disclose the work under FARA, according to the settlement.In announcing the settlement, John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s national security division, said Skadden Arps’s failure to register under FARA “hid from the public that its report was part of a Ukrainian foreign influence campaign,” depriving Americans of the ability “to consider the identity of the speaker as they evaluate the substance of the speech.”Neither the settlement nor Mr. Demers named either Mr. Craig or The Times and its reporter, David E. Sanger, but their identities are clear from the context. At issue is whether Mr. Craig proactively contacted Mr. Sanger to provide and promote the report, which could fall under the public relations prong of FARA, or merely responded to inquiries from The Times and other media outlets about Skadden Arps’s analysis.William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy, lawyers for Mr. Craig, said their client “did nothing that required him to register in connection with his work on the Tymoshenko report. The Skadden settlement was done without his knowledge, and the assertion that he made intentionally false statements to the FARA unit is entirely untrue.”Mr. Craig’s allies reject the characterization that he was integrally involved in the public relations strategy surrounding the report.

It’s far less than he could have served.CreditCreditAlex Brandon/Associated PressBy Sharon LaFraniereMarch 7, 2019ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Paul Manafort, the political consultant and Trump presidential campaign chairman whose lucrative work in Ukraine and ties to well-connected Russians made him a target of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was sentenced on Thursday to nearly four years in prison in the financial fraud case that left his grand lifestyle and power-broker reputation in ruins.The sentence in the highest-profile criminal case mounted by the special counsel’s office was far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under sentencing guidelines. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said that although Mr. Manafort’s crimes were “very serious,” following the guidelines would have resulted in an unduly harsh punishment.A team of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors sat glum-faced as Judge Ellis delivered his decision. Mr. Manafort, who has gout and came to the hearing in a wheelchair with his foot heavily bandaged, had asked the judge for compassion. “To say I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,” he said in a barely audible voice, reading from a prepared statement.Of the half-dozen former Trump associates prosecuted by Mr. Mueller, Mr. Manafort garnered the harshest punishment yet in the case that came to a conclusion on Thursday — the first of two for which Mr. Manafort is being sentenced this month. While prosecutors sought no specific sentence, some legal experts said a prison term that amounts to one-fifth of the lightest punishment recommended had to disappoint them.“It’s atrociously low,” said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who teaches law at the University of Michigan and watched much of Mr. Manafort’s trial over the summer. While “many judges do sentence leniently in white-collar cases,” she said, “dropping all the way from 19 years to four years is absurd.”[“I am a Caesar in my own Rome,” Judge Ellis once said as he demanded a breakneck pace during the Manafort trial.]Mr. Manafort’s allies had long believed that Mr. Manafort had a chance of leniency from Judge Ellis, a Reagan appointee who sparred repeatedly with the special counsel’s team during the trial and has publicly voiced concerns that independent prosecutors have too much power. Minutes after the three-hour hearing started, Judge Ellis, unprompted, noted that Mr. Manafort was “not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election,” the core of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry.Although Judge Ellis seemed swayed by the defense’s arguments, Mr. Manafort may face a less sympathetic reception next week when he is sentenced in the District of Columbia on two conspiracy counts by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court. Those charges each carry a maximum of five years. Kevin Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, asked Judge Ellis to order that Mr. Manafort serve both sentences simultaneously. But Judge Ellis said that was up to Judge Jackson.For nearly two years, prosecutors pursued Mr. Manafort on two tracks, charging him with more than two dozen felonies, including obstruction of justice, bank fraud and violations of lobbying laws. They ultimately won Mr. Manafort’s pledge to cooperate after he was convicted of eight felonies in the Northern Virginia case and faced a second trial in Washington.But although he met with the special counsel’s office for a total of about 50 hours, prosecutors said on Thursday that Mr. Manafort provided little information of value for their inquiry into how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 presidential race and whether any Trump associates conspired with them.Most of what Mr. Manafort told the office of the special counsel “we already knew or was already in documents,” Greg D. Andres, the lead prosecutor in the case, said in court. “It certainly wasn’t 50 hours of information that was useful.”The evidence in the case before Judge Ellis showed that Mr. Manafort hid millions of dollars of income in overseas accounts and lied to banks to obtain millions more in loans — a financial scheme that prosecutors said was rooted in greed and in Mr. Manafort’s sense that he was above the law.They described him as a hardened, remorseless criminal who never fully accepted responsibility for his offenses and who continued to lie to federal prosecutors even after he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in a related case in Washington and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office last fall.[The rise and fall of Paul Manafort: greed, deception and ego.]But defense lawyers cited Mr. Manafort’s age, health problems and lack of a criminal record. He will turn 70 next month.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Judge Ellis said that Mr. Manafort “has lived an otherwise blameless life,” and he cited other tax cases that had resulted in minimal prison time. “The government cannot sweep away the history of all these other sentences,” he said.The judge ordered Mr. Manafort to pay $25 million in restitution and a $50,000 fine. He also gave Mr. Manafort credit for the nine months he had already spent in jail, which could mean Mr. Manafort would be released in just over three years.Mr. Manafort was a prime target for Mr. Mueller, who is believed to be winding down his 22-month investigation and is expected to deliver a report soon to Attorney General William P. Barr. While the prosecutions against Mr. Manafort did not involve his five months of work for the Trump campaign, prosecutors clearly hoped for the collateral benefit of winning his cooperation with the Russia inquiry.At a closed hearing in February, Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s top deputies, told Judge Jackson that it was highly unusual for the government to strike a plea deal with a defendant like Mr. Manafort who had already put the government through a trial. He alluded to the government’s motives for making such a pact, citing “enormous interest” in “the intelligence that could be gathered in having a cooperating witness in this particular investigation.”But prosecutors abandoned the plea agreement in November, saying Mr. Manafort had repeatedly lied to them. In a recent ruling, Judge Jackson agreed that Mr. Manafort had deceived investigators about three matters.One was revealed through an inadvertent mistake in a court filing in January that showed that Mr. Manafort had lied to the prosecutors about his interactions with a Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who has been identified by prosecutors as having ties to Russian intelligence. Those interactions included Mr. Manafort’s transferring campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik.The special counsel’s office had wanted that information kept out of the public eye to protect an open investigation. It remains unclear why Mr. Kilimnik would want such polling data, what exactly he did with it and whether the data transfer might have helped inform the Russian government’s covert operation to interfere with the American election.It is also unclear why Mr. Manafort lied about it; prosecutors appeared to suggest that Mr. Manafort might have feared that the revelation that he had turned over polling data would have reduced his chances of receiving a presidential pardon for his crimes.Before Judge Ellis, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers repeatedly suggested that the special counsel’s office pursued their client because of his importance to the Russia inquiry. They said his political consulting work for four American presidents, including Mr. Trump, spoke to his high ideals. And they argued that the special counsel’s office had vilified him for what are essentially garden-variety crimes that for other defendants merited only limited time behind bars.“Most importantly, what you saw today is the same thing that we have said from Day 1,” Mr. Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, said in a short statement outside the courthouse. “There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official or Russia.”While Judge Ellis faulted Mr. Manafort for not apologizing for his criminal conduct, he also noted that the special counsel’s office had not requested a specific prison term.During the trial, prosecutors put forward exhaustive evidence of how Mr. Manafort had illegally concealed his work on behalf of political parties in Ukraine that were aligned with Russia and of how he hid more than $55 million in payments from that work in more than 30 overseas bank accounts.Once his income from Ukraine dried up, the evidence showed, Mr. Manafort deceived banks to obtain loans to sustain a lavish lifestyle. At the same time, he worked for the Trump campaign at no cost, apparently hoping his status as campaign chairman would attract deep-pocketed foreign clients. He was fired from the campaign after five months when the scandal over his hidden income from Ukraine broke in August 2016.“The defendant blames everyone from the special counsel’s office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.Mr. Manafort was indicted on 18 counts in the Northern Virginia case, but the jury convicted him on only eight: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Because of one holdout juror, the panel deadlocked on the other charges. Mr. Manafort admitted that he was guilty of those as well, though, as part of his plea agreement.Correction: March 7, 2019An earlier version of this article misidentified the lawyer Andrew Weissmann.

He alluded to the government’s motives for making such a pact, citing “enormous interest” in “the intelligence that could be gathered in having a cooperating witness in this particular investigation.”But prosecutors abandoned the plea agreement in November, saying Mr. Manafort had repeatedly lied to them. In a recent ruling, Judge Jackson agreed that Mr. Manafort had deceived investigators about three matters.One was revealed through an inadvertent mistake in a court filing in January that showed that Mr. Manafort had lied to the prosecutors about his interactions with a Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who has been identified by prosecutors as having ties to Russian intelligence. Those interactions included Mr. Manafort’s transferring campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik.The special counsel’s office had wanted that information kept out of the public eye to protect an open investigation. It remains unclear why Mr. Kilimnik would want such polling data, what exactly he did with it and whether the data transfer might have helped inform the Russian government’s covert operation to interfere with the American election.It is also unclear why Mr. Manafort lied about it; prosecutors appeared to suggest that Mr. Manafort might have feared that the revelation that he had turned over polling data would have reduced his chances of receiving a presidential pardon for his crimes.Before Judge Ellis, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers repeatedly suggested that the special counsel’s office pursued their client because of his importance to the Russia inquiry. They said his political consulting work for four American presidents, including Mr. Trump, spoke to his high ideals. And they argued that the special counsel’s office had vilified him for what are essentially garden-variety crimes that for other defendants merited only limited time behind bars.“Most importantly, what you saw today is the same thing that we have said from Day 1,” Mr. Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, said in a short statement outside the courthouse. “There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official or Russia.”While Judge Ellis faulted Mr. Manafort for not apologizing for his criminal conduct, he also noted that the special counsel’s office had not requested a specific prison term.During the trial, prosecutors put forward exhaustive evidence of how Mr. Manafort had illegally concealed his work on behalf of political parties in Ukraine that were aligned with Russia and of how he hid more than $55 million in payments from that work in more than 30 overseas bank accounts.Once his income from Ukraine dried up, the evidence showed, Mr. Manafort deceived banks to obtain loans to sustain a lavish lifestyle. At the same time, he worked for the Trump campaign at no cost, apparently hoping his status as campaign chairman would attract deep-pocketed foreign clients. He was fired from the campaign after five months when the scandal over his hidden income from Ukraine broke in August 2016.“The defendant blames everyone from the special counsel’s office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.Mr. Manafort was indicted on 18 counts in the Northern Virginia case, but the jury convicted him on only eight: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Because of one holdout juror, the panel deadlocked on the other charges. Mr. Manafort admitted that he was guilty of those as well, though, as part of his plea agreement.Correction: March 7, 2019An earlier version of this article misidentified the lawyer Andrew Weissmann.

It’s far less than he could have served.CreditCreditAlex Brandon/Associated PressBy Sharon LaFraniereMarch 7, 2019ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Paul Manafort, the political consultant and Trump presidential campaign chairman whose lucrative work in Ukraine and ties to well-connected Russians made him a target of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was sentenced on Thursday to nearly four years in prison in the financial fraud case that left his grand lifestyle and power-broker reputation in ruins.The sentence in the highest-profile criminal case mounted by the special counsel’s office was far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under sentencing guidelines. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said that although Mr. Manafort’s crimes were “very serious,” following the guidelines would have resulted in an unduly harsh punishment.A team of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors sat glum-faced as Judge Ellis delivered his decision. Mr. Manafort, who has gout and came to the hearing in a wheelchair with his foot heavily bandaged, had asked the judge for compassion. “To say I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,” he said in a barely audible voice, reading from a prepared statement.Of the half-dozen former Trump associates prosecuted by Mr. Mueller, Mr. Manafort garnered the harshest punishment yet in the case that came to a conclusion on Thursday — the first of two for which Mr. Manafort is being sentenced this month. While prosecutors sought no specific sentence, some legal experts said a prison term that amounts to one-fifth of the lightest punishment recommended had to disappoint them.“It’s atrociously low,” said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who teaches law at the University of Michigan and watched much of Mr. Manafort’s trial over the summer. While “many judges do sentence leniently in white-collar cases,” she said, “dropping all the way from 19 years to four years is absurd.”[“I am a Caesar in my own Rome,” Judge Ellis once said as he demanded a breakneck pace during the Manafort trial.]Mr. Manafort’s allies had long believed that Mr. Manafort had a chance of leniency from Judge Ellis, a Reagan appointee who sparred repeatedly with the special counsel’s team during the trial and has publicly voiced concerns that independent prosecutors have too much power. Minutes after the three-hour hearing started, Judge Ellis, unprompted, noted that Mr. Manafort was “not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election,” the core of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry.Although Judge Ellis seemed swayed by the defense’s arguments, Mr. Manafort may face a less sympathetic reception next week when he is sentenced in the District of Columbia on two conspiracy counts by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court. Those charges each carry a maximum of five years. Kevin Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, asked Judge Ellis to order that Mr. Manafort serve both sentences simultaneously. But Judge Ellis said that was up to Judge Jackson.For nearly two years, prosecutors pursued Mr. Manafort on two tracks, charging him with more than two dozen felonies, including obstruction of justice, bank fraud and violations of lobbying laws. They ultimately won Mr. Manafort’s pledge to cooperate after he was convicted of eight felonies in the Northern Virginia case and faced a second trial in Washington.But although he met with the special counsel’s office for a total of about 50 hours, prosecutors said on Thursday that Mr. Manafort provided little information of value for their inquiry into how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 presidential race and whether any Trump associates conspired with them.Most of what Mr. Manafort told the office of the special counsel “we already knew or was already in documents,” Greg D. Andres, the lead prosecutor in the case, said in court. “It certainly wasn’t 50 hours of information that was useful.”The evidence in the case before Judge Ellis showed that Mr. Manafort hid millions of dollars of income in overseas accounts and lied to banks to obtain millions more in loans — a financial scheme that prosecutors said was rooted in greed and in Mr. Manafort’s sense that he was above the law.They described him as a hardened, remorseless criminal who never fully accepted responsibility for his offenses and who continued to lie to federal prosecutors even after he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in a related case in Washington and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office last fall.[The rise and fall of Paul Manafort: greed, deception and ego.]But defense lawyers cited Mr. Manafort’s age, health problems and lack of a criminal record. He will turn 70 next month.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Judge Ellis said that Mr. Manafort “has lived an otherwise blameless life,” and he cited other tax cases that had resulted in minimal prison time. “The government cannot sweep away the history of all these other sentences,” he said.The judge ordered Mr. Manafort to pay $25 million in restitution and a $50,000 fine. He also gave Mr. Manafort credit for the nine months he had already spent in jail, which could mean Mr. Manafort would be released in just over three years.Mr. Manafort was a prime target for Mr. Mueller, who is believed to be winding down his 22-month investigation and is expected to deliver a report soon to Attorney General William P.

While the prosecutions against Mr. Manafort did not involve his five months of work for the Trump campaign, prosecutors clearly hoped for the collateral benefit of winning his cooperation with the Russia inquiry.At a closed hearing in February, Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s top deputies, told Judge Jackson that it was highly unusual for the government to strike a plea deal with a defendant like Mr. Manafort who had already put the government through a trial. He alluded to the government’s motives for making such a pact, citing “enormous interest” in “the intelligence that could be gathered in having a cooperating witness in this particular investigation.”But prosecutors abandoned the plea agreement in November, saying Mr. Manafort had repeatedly lied to them. In a recent ruling, Judge Jackson agreed that Mr. Manafort had deceived investigators about three matters.One was revealed through an inadvertent mistake in a court filing in January that showed that Mr. Manafort had lied to the prosecutors about his interactions with a Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who has been identified by prosecutors as having ties to Russian intelligence. Those interactions included Mr. Manafort’s transferring campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik.The special counsel’s office had wanted that information kept out of the public eye to protect an open investigation. It remains unclear why Mr. Kilimnik would want such polling data, what exactly he did with it and whether the data transfer might have helped inform the Russian government’s covert operation to interfere with the American election.It is also unclear why Mr. Manafort lied about it; prosecutors appeared to suggest that Mr. Manafort might have feared that the revelation that he had turned over polling data would have reduced his chances of receiving a presidential pardon for his crimes.Before Judge Ellis, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers repeatedly suggested that the special counsel’s office pursued their client because of his importance to the Russia inquiry. They said his political consulting work for four American presidents, including Mr. Trump, spoke to his high ideals. And they argued that the special counsel’s office had vilified him for what are essentially garden-variety crimes that for other defendants merited only limited time behind bars.“Most importantly, what you saw today is the same thing that we have said from Day 1,” Mr. Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, said in a short statement outside the courthouse. “There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official or Russia.”While Judge Ellis faulted Mr. Manafort for not apologizing for his criminal conduct, he also noted that the special counsel’s office had not requested a specific prison term.During the trial, prosecutors put forward exhaustive evidence of how Mr. Manafort had illegally concealed his work on behalf of political parties in Ukraine that were aligned with Russia and of how he hid more than $55 million in payments from that work in more than 30 overseas bank accounts.Once his income from Ukraine dried up, the evidence showed, Mr. Manafort deceived banks to obtain loans to sustain a lavish lifestyle. At the same time, he worked for the Trump campaign at no cost, apparently hoping his status as campaign chairman would attract deep-pocketed foreign clients. He was fired from the campaign after five months when the scandal over his hidden income from Ukraine broke in August 2016.“The defendant blames everyone from the special counsel’s office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.Mr. Manafort was indicted on 18 counts in the Northern Virginia case, but the jury convicted him on only eight: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Because of one holdout juror, the panel deadlocked on the other charges. Mr. Manafort admitted that he was guilty of those as well, though, as part of his plea agreement.Correction: March 7, 2019An earlier version of this article misidentified the lawyer Andrew Weissmann. He is a top deputy for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, not for Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman.Noah Weiland and Zach Montague contributed reporting.

Tillis had previously said he would vote to block President Trump’s national emergency declaration, but later reversed himself.CreditCreditJ. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressThis article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.Congressional Republicans offered up two conflicting storylines yesterday, and it’s worth keeping both in mind.1) Multiple senators hypocritically supported President Trump’s emergency declaration for a border wall.Thom Tillis of North Carolina was the most blatant. Two weeks ago, he opposed the Trump move as an unacceptable power grab, writing in a Washington Post op-ed: “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]As recently as Wednesday, his staff sent nasty emails of denial to Aaron Blake of The Post when Blake described Tillis as turning “wobbly.”Yesterday, however, Tillis caved. He did so after conservatives began talking about supporting a primary challenge to him in 2020 if he voted against Trump. “This is Trump’s party,” Rachel Bitecofer of Christopher Newport University notes.Of the seven Republican senators facing competitive races next year, six voted with Trump yesterday. They are evidently more scared of losing a primary than of losing a general election, as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion points out.Cory Gardner of Colorado was another Republican who supported the emergency declaration yesterday. The Denver Post’s editorial board, which had backed Gardner in his 2014 campaign, responded with: “Our endorsement of Cory Gardner was a mistake.”2) And yet Trump is a weak president.As nervous as congressional Republicans may be about primary challenges, they also keep showing that their support of Trump is almost purely self-interested — and not very deep. Even with the hypocritical support, 12 Republicans voted against Trump’s declaration, allowing the measure to pass 59-41 and presumably forcing him to issue a humiliating veto. The vote, The Times editorial board writes, “is a big deal. In practical terms, it could fortify the multiple lawsuits pending against Mr. Trump’s absurd declaration, a faux emergency so nakedly political that even he admitted it was unnecessary.”Not long before the Senate vote, the House yesterday passed a resolution — in a 420-to-0 shutout — demanding that the Justice Department release the Mueller report. The combination of the two votes was a remarkable rebuke. Yes, congressional Republicans are doing far less than they should to stand up to Trump. Many of them, like Tillis, have made themselves look foolish in the process. But it’s also the case that Trump receives less support from his own party than any other president in recent history.His presidency, as Bloomberg’s Bernstein has written, is entering “a dangerous phase” for him.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Read more here.]It could be any day now.After nearly two years, 34 indictments or guilty pleas, and countless angry presidential tweets, the Mueller report, we are told, could be winding down.When Robert Mueller finally sends his findings to the attorney general, what will we do? It depends, in part, on when that happens. For some big stories that have broken outside our typical production schedule — like on a Friday — we’ve put out special editions, a kind of emergency show. We did that when President Trump fired Steve Bannon, his closest White House adviser; when Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.; and when the president bragged to Russian diplomats about firing F.B.I. director James Comey, saying it would take the heat off the Russia investigation.We don’t yet know when the report will land, but we’ve approached this story feeling that our greatest responsibility is to set the right expectations. That’s why we did something we’ve never done before: a series of explanatory episodes designed to set the table for the Mueller report — how its release could happen (or not happen), what it might conclude (or not conclude), and what it would trigger next (or not trigger next).The series is called “What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report),” a nod to Heidi Murkoff and Sharon Mazel’s ubiquitous parenting guide. It began with an explanation of rules surrounding the report’s handoff from the special counsel to the attorney general. It then explored Mueller’s options for recommending charges against President Trump, and concluded with the role of Congress’s oversight committees.The worst thing we, as journalists, can do in moments like this is leave you unprepared to process a historic moment. We hope that if you listen to the series, you’ll feel ready for what the next few days, weeks and months will bring.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.On “The Daily” this week“There’s an entire generation of people who have been exposed to radical extremist politics online.” Kevin Roose on how the internet played a role in the New Zealand mosque attacks.Boeing wanted to avoid expensive training for pilots flying its new line of airplanes.

As we explored that history, producer Jonathan Wolfe called up Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who, until recently, was the only person to ever be cured. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:From ‘The Daily’: A Conversation With the Berlin PatientJonathan Wolfe, a producer for “The Daily,” spoke with Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who is the first person known to be cured of H.I.V.‘I imagined hearing my father’s voice’When asked what it would be like to hear that a cure for H.I.V. had been found at last, AIDS activist Peter Staley described a scene from the movie “Longtime Companion”: “It’s like a big gay disco. But it’s everybody we’ve lost, and they’re just celebrating. It might be like that.”That moment from Thursday’s episode struck a chord with Stacy Brink, a listener from Charlotte, N.C. And her response struck a chord with us. “As I listened to Mr. Staley, I imagined hearing my father’s voice. My father who died of AIDS in 1986 when I was 7 years old. My father who loved Billy Joel and made the best French toast. My father in his blue robe. My father who I was unable to hug or kiss or lie next to because the doctors feared I would be ‘contaminated.’ Thank you, Mr. Staley, for fighting and for your courage. I look forward to dancing with my dad at the gay disco when we finally have a cure.”That’s it for The Daily newsletter.

We did that when President Trump fired Steve Bannon, his closest White House adviser; when Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.; and when the president bragged to Russian diplomats about firing F.B.I. director James Comey, saying it would take the heat off the Russia investigation.We don’t yet know when the report will land, but we’ve approached this story feeling that our greatest responsibility is to set the right expectations. That’s why we did something we’ve never done before: a series of explanatory episodes designed to set the table for the Mueller report — how its release could happen (or not happen), what it might conclude (or not conclude), and what it would trigger next (or not trigger next).The series is called “What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report),” a nod to Heidi Murkoff and Sharon Mazel’s ubiquitous parenting guide. It began with an explanation of rules surrounding the report’s handoff from the special counsel to the attorney general. It then explored Mueller’s options for recommending charges against President Trump, and concluded with the role of Congress’s oversight committees.The worst thing we, as journalists, can do in moments like this is leave you unprepared to process a historic moment.

As we explored that history, producer Jonathan Wolfe called up Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who, until recently, was the only person to ever be cured. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:From ‘The Daily’: A Conversation With the Berlin PatientJonathan Wolfe, a producer for “The Daily,” spoke with Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who is the first person known to be cured of H.I.V.‘I imagined hearing my father’s voice’When asked what it would be like to hear that a cure for H.I.V. had been found at last, AIDS activist Peter Staley described a scene from the movie “Longtime Companion”: “It’s like a big gay disco. But it’s everybody we’ve lost, and they’re just celebrating. It might be like that.”That moment from Thursday’s episode struck a chord with Stacy Brink, a listener from Charlotte, N.C. And her response struck a chord with us. “As I listened to Mr. Staley, I imagined hearing my father’s voice. My father who died of AIDS in 1986 when I was 7 years old. My father who loved Billy Joel and made the best French toast. My father in his blue robe. My father who I was unable to hug or kiss or lie next to because the doctors feared I would be ‘contaminated.’ Thank you, Mr. Staley, for fighting and for your courage. I look forward to dancing with my dad at the gay disco when we finally have a cure.”That’s it for The Daily newsletter.
