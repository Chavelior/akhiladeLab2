The district she won in November was one in which residents had incomes that were higher than the statewide median.
CreditCreditJoshua Lott for The New York TimesOne clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that President Trump and his fellow Republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground.Take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, states that provided the Electoral College votes crucial to Trump’s capture of the White House.John C. Austin, the director of the Michigan Economic Center and a senior fellow at Brookings, analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year — 12 from Republican to Democrat, three from Democrat to Republican — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa.Austin found a striking pattern. In the majority of districts that went from Republican to Democrat:Residents had incomes higher than statewide medians, as well as higher educational attainment — in most places by considerable margins. Conversely, in the three districts that moved from blue to red, incomes and educational attainment lagged statewide figures.The accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts.Where Voters Are Trending BlueIndustrial-state House districts that changed from Republican to Democratic representation in 2018 tended to be economically better off than their states overall. Figures are the difference between median district income and statewide median income among districts that changed parties.

By The New York Times | Source: analysis of 2017 American Community Survey data by John Austin for BrookingsThe same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms.In September 2018, Siobhan Hughes and Dante Chinni of The Wall Street Journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the Cook Political Report. They then ranked the races on the basis of an “economic-health index created by the Institute of International Finance.”Of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health, eight were categorized “lean Republican” by the Cook Political Report, and two “lean Democrat.” Before the November election, nine of those 10 seats were held by Republicans.On Election Day, Democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts.Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, both of Brookings, worked with John Harwood of CNBC to analyze Democratic and Republican-held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election. Their conclusions reinforce the findings of Austin, Hughes and Chinni.The key result: the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by Democrats, while Republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous, measured by share of G.D.P. The accompanying chart illustrates their analysis.Rich District, Poor DistrictThe most economically productive U.S. House districts are led by Democrats. Most of the poorest 20 districts voted Republican.

By The New York Times | Source: Brookings analysis of data from Emsi, the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe authors’ calculation of the contribution to the G.D.P. of every congressional district showed that Democratic districts produce $10.2 trillion of the nation’s goods and services and Republican districts $6.2 trillion.This trend creates a significant dilemma for Trump and the Republican Party. Candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections, they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn. Electorally speaking, in other words, Republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline.Let’s return to John Austin of the Michigan Economic Center. In an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly: “A rising economic tide tends to sink the Trump tugboat,” adding“Certainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned, not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and ‘blaming others’ for people’s woes (like immigrants and people of color) that fuel Trump’s supporters.”In June 2017, Austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the Republican Party. His study of the 2016 presidential results in the Midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help Republicans. In that earlier report, Austin wrote:The small- and medium-sized factory towns that dot the highways and byways of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin have lost their anchor employers and are struggling to fill the void. Many of these communities, including once solidly Democratic-voting, union-heavy, blue collar strongholds, flipped to Trump in 2016.This pattern is not limited to the United States. There are numerous studies demonstrating that European and British voters who are falling behind in the global economy, and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state, drove Brexit as well as the rise of right-wing populist parties.One paper, “Measuring the Effects of Economic Austerity on Pro-Sociality: Evidence from Greece,” by Nicholas Sambanis, Anna Schultz and Elena Nikolova, political scientists at Penn, Duke and University College London, found, for example,A strong relationship between job loss and decreased generalized solidarity. We find evidence of in-group bias and the bias becomes more pronounced due to exposure to austerity policies.In a July 2018 paper, “Did Austerity Cause Brexit?” Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right-wing populist party UKIP in Britain and to voter approval of Brexit.These political movements “are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010,” Fetzer writes. Examination of economic trends, welfare policy and polling data shows, according to Fetzer, thatthe EU referendum (Brexit) could have resulted in a Remain victory had it not been for a range of austerity-induced welfare reforms. These reforms activated existing economic grievances. Further, auxiliary results suggest that the underlying economic grievances have broader origins than what the current literature on Brexit suggests. Up until 2010, the UK’s welfare state evened out growing income differences across the skill divide through transfer payments. This pattern markedly stops from 2010 onward as austerity started to bite.There are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against Brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country.In a separate 2017 paper, “Who Voted For Brexit,” Fetzer and two fellow economists at the University of Warwick, Sascha O. Becker and Dennis Novy, found that “in particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent U.K. austerity program are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share.” This heldall across the board: more deprivation is tightly associated with a larger Vote Leave share or, vice versa; less deprivation is tightly associated with a lower Vote Leave share.The results here and in England reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get, the better the right does.As a rule, as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure, they become more generous and more liberal. In the United States, this means that voters move to the left; in Britain, it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the European Union.In his forthcoming book, “Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics” Carles Boix, a political scientist at Princeton, describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid-1970s led to a liberal international consensus:In light of the historical experience of advanced countries, embracing the program of embedded liberalism made economic and political sense. Twentieth-century democratic capitalism had proved to be both successful and resilient: it had delivered high growth; it had allowed governments to fund generous social programs; and it had sent its main political and economic competitor — communism — to the ash heap of history.As global competition, outsourcing and later, automation, began to produce significant economic disruption, beginning in the 1970s, this liberal consensus frayed.Boix writes,The structure of electoral participation became strongly polarized across the Atlantic — very much in line with the economic transformations brought about by the decline of industry and by globalization in the last forty years.In the United States, economic adversity helped produce Trump, whose inaugural speech (reportedly the handiwork of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller) Boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism:For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left. And the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now.Together, the trends described above raise an intriguing question: If the Republican Party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind, does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline?I asked scholars and officials at the Niskanen Center — a Washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division — whether they thought the Republican Party has come to recognize that prosperity helps Democrats, while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants, resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban America. Does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline?Jerry Taylor, president of Niskanen, replied to my inquiry by making the case that “as conservatives see it, the more visible government dysfunction is, the better. It provides civic education.”Working from this premise, Taylor argued that as far as conservatives go,anything that dispels the illusion that government can be harnessed for positive ends is generally a good thing, and anything that reduces its power and scope is a salutary development.Taylor disputed the suggestion that “Republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white America.” Instead, he said, they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth isonly reliably ensured when government is minimized, taxes are nearly inconsequential, and free markets and property rights are given the greatest scope possible. Marry that with their belief that a rising economic tide will lift all boats, and you can quickly see why they’re at a loss to explain what’s going on in rural America.Will Wilkinson, the center’s vice president for research, wrote back to me:The G.O.P.’s success in struggling places has given them a false impression that voters who live there will stay faithful as long as they keep feeding them culture-war chum. Trump’s populism offered a false but compelling diagnosis of their economic problems, immigrants and insufficiently protectionist trade policy, which dovetails neatly with rural white anxieties about declining cultural status and relative political power. If you can align threats to identity with threats to material security, as Trump did, it’s pretty powerful.But, in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing, Wilkinson continued, Trump’strade war is positively hurting agriculture and manufacturing, and every Republican member of congress has voted multiple times to strip away health benefits — leaving ‘identity threat’ as the party’s last resort.What’s more, Wilkinson noted,Identity threat — ‘I don’t recognize this country anymore’ — is very abstract compared to material threat — ‘my daughter with leukemia will die if they don’t cover pre-existing conditions’ — and far less motivating. And the argument that the G.O.P. establishment itself has become a threat to economic/material welfare has started to become persuasive.This has put the Republican Party in a painful position, according to Wilkinson:It’s going to get worse for the G.O.P. as the urgency of the economic problems grows. But they just don’t understand that pushing the same button over and over isn’t going to have the same effect. And this is so in part because they don’t really want to see the seriousness of economic divergence, because they have no idea what to do about it that is remotely consistent with Zombie Reagan social policy dogma.Brink Lindsey, vice president for policy, replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle: “You don’t need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain Republican governance failures.”In Lindsey’s view,it starts in ideological self-delusion — that government is simply incapable of performing well, so starving it of funds is always a good idea and trying to make it work better is a waste of time. The problem starts there, as I said, but it doesn’t end there, as these attitudes can very easily merge into cynical, lazy indifference to public administration and onward to outright venality and corruption. And, of course, this ideological stance turns out to be incredibly convenient for rich donors looking for any excuse to keep their taxes down.This is not, according to Lindsey,a conspiracy, but rather a rotten equilibrium. Lack of trust in government brings charlatans to power, further reducing trust in government and widening the path to power for future charlatans.In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the Republican Party’s “rotten equilibrium.”The first, of course, is Trump himself. His victory in 2016 was a charlatan’s ascent, and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government — fuel, in one sense, for the continued success of charlatans. For the moment, though, his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force.Trump’s second, if less heralded, achievement has been to invigorate the Democratic opposition. He has inspired an immense, rambunctious, intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates — some prepared, some less so, to dislodge him from the White House.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Thomas B.

It is evident that President Trump is acting in the interests of a foreign power and contrary to American interests. It is unthinkable to confirm a nominee for attorney general who equivocates about the release of the extensive investigative report by Robert Mueller that every member of Congress must be permitted to see in full. If Mr. Barr cannot straight out commit to the release of Mr. Mueller’s full report to Congress, with some possible redactions of the names of nongovernment individuals for reasons of their safety, then Mr. Barr must be unanimously voted down in committee. This is not the time to play with fire. Congress must have the information it needs to fully evaluate the role that Mr. Trump has played in what is the undeniable large-scale undermining of American security.Joe GrossmanBoulder, Colo.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Barr and the Mueller Report.

Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, said “it is in the best interest of everyone” that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, be allowed to finish his investigation. He also pledged not to allow the president to “correct and put spin on” a Mueller report before it was released publicly.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Charlie Savage, Nicholas Fandos and Katie BennerJan. 15, 2019WASHINGTON — William P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, assured senators at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he would permit the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to complete the Russia investigation and said he was determined to resist any pressure from Mr. Trump to use law enforcement for political purposes.Mr. Barr, whose confirmation seems virtually assured, pointed to his age and background — he served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 — as buffers to potential intrusions on the Justice Department’s traditional independence. He suggested he had no further political aspirations that might cloud his judgment, the way that future ambitions might give pause to a younger nominee, as well as the experience to fight political interference.“I am in a position in life where I can provide the leadership necessary to protect the independence and reputation of the department,” Mr. Barr, 68, told the Senate Judiciary Committee, adding that he would not hesitate to resign if Mr. Trump pushed him to act improperly.“I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong — by anybody, whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president,” Mr. Barr said. “I’m going to do what I think is right.”He also pledged that he would refuse any order from Mr. Trump either to fire Mr. Mueller without good cause in violation of regulations or to rescind those rules first.ImageWilliam P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, said he would protect the Justice Department from any possible political intrusions.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said.Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general came under President George Bush, who was known for his prudent and measured approach. If confirmed, Mr. Barr would serve under a president hardly known for self-restraint. Mr. Trump repeatedly excoriated Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which Mr. Trump has called a “witch hunt,” and pushed him to open criminal investigations into political adversaries like Hillary Clinton.[President Trump says he alone can do it. His attorney general nominee usually agrees.]Over hours of testimony, Mr. Barr displayed a grasp of policy and demonstrated his experience as a Washington hand and member of the Republican legal establishment. He is expected to be confirmed, both because Republicans control the Senate and because Democrats are deeply suspicious of Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general whom Mr. Trump installed after ousting Mr. Sessions in November.“Mr. Barr is qualified by any reasonable standard,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the committee’s chairman, said after the hearing, adding that he saw no reason to doubt Mr. Barr would be confirmed. “And if he’s not qualified, I don’t know who they are ever going to pick.”During his testimony, Mr. Barr described being asked whether he was interested in joining Mr. Trump’s defense team in June 2017 by a friend of the president’s. Although Mr. Barr agreed to meet with Mr. Trump — and told him, he said, that Mr. Mueller was both a personal friend and “a straight shooter who should be dealt with as such” — he declined to join his legal team.ImageSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the committee’s new chairman, obtained Mr. Barr’s assurance that he would look into who opened the investigation into the president at the F.B.I. or the Justice Department.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times“My wife and I were sort of looking forward to a bit of respite, and I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder,” Mr. Barr said.Asked by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, why as a “rational person” he would want the job after seeing Mr. Trump’s “unrelenting criticism” of Mr. Sessions, Mr. Barr portrayed himself as an institutionalist.“Because I love the department and all its components, including the F.B.I.,” Mr. Barr said. “I think they are critical institutions that are essential to preserving the rule of law, which is the heartbeat of this country.”Mr. Barr’s testimony also touched on many other issues.Regarding Mr. Trump’s demand for funding for a border wall, which has prompted the longest government shutdown in American history, Mr. Barr expressed qualified support for expanding barriers along the border with Mexico where they could be part of “common sense” immigration enforcement. But he sidestepped questions about whether Mr. Trump could lawfully redirect military funds to build a wall without congressional authorization, as the president has threatened to invoke emergency powers to do.Asked by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, about remarks he made in 2005 defending the George W. Bush administration’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” program and the idea that it was lawful to use “pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk” so long as it does not cross the line to torture, Mr. Barr said he would obey and uphold a 2015 law restricting American interrogators to using only those techniques listed in the Army Field Manual.VideoWilliam P.

Rosenstein, who is widely expected to leave if Mr. Barr is confirmed, the nominee said he had not — and, indeed, had asked Mr. Rosenstein to stay on longer for a transition period.And he assured senators from both parties that his views on the criminal justice system had evolved from the early 1990s, when he advocated stiffer sentences for drug offenders, and that he would fully carry out substantial sentencing and prison law changes passed last month.But the hearing repeatedly returned to Russia’s attempts to manipulate the American election process and the open investigation by Mr. Mueller into Moscow’s campaign of subversion — and possible links to Mr. Trump and his associates.Early in the hearing, Mr. Graham brought up the F.B.I.’s newly revealed counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was working with the Russians, asking incredulously whether Mr. Barr had “heard of such a thing in all the time you have been associated with the department.”When Mr. Barr answered that he had not, Mr. Graham sought and obtained Mr. Barr’s assurance that he would look into who opened the investigation into the president at the F.B.I. or the Justice Department and to tell the committee whether it was appropriate.ImageMr. Barr appeared to emphasize a softer vision of presidential power than the unusually expansive view he has shared throughout his career.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesLater, Mr. Barr also defended as “entirely proper” his decision to write an unsolicited, lengthy memo to the Trump administration legal team in June arguing that laws against obstruction of justice cannot criminalize a president’s use of his constitutional powers — like when Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director.Insisting he had not been not trying to “ingratiate” himself with the Trump administration by writing the memo, Mr. Barr played it down as based on mere speculation about the basis for Mr. Mueller’s obstruction inquiry. He said that he believed that other potential actions by a president, like witness tampering, would be a legitimate basis for an obstruction investigation.In any case, Mr. Barr repeatedly said he would let Mr. Mueller, whom he described as a friend of his for decades, finish his work and dismissed Mr. Trump’s attacks on the inquiry.“I don’t believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt,” Mr. Barr said. But in another moment, he called Mr. Trump’s use of that term “understandable” and refused to criticize the president’s attacks on Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department.Mr. Barr also appeared to emphasize a softer vision of presidential power than the unusually expansive view he has largely advanced throughout his career — for example, previously portraying the president instead of the attorney general as the nation’s top law-enforcement official, who wields unfettered power to “start or stop a law enforcement proceeding.”ImageMr. Barr pledged to seek the advice of ethics lawyers in the Justice Department about whether he should recuse himself from the Russia investigation because of a memo he wrote criticizing an aspect of it.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesHis philosophy on executive authority has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash Mr. Trump. But in several ways on Tuesday, Mr. Barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings, putting greater emphasis on the Justice Department’s independence and legal limits on the presidency.For example, Mr. Barr said that if a president directed the department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family, that would violate the Constitution. And asked by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, Mr. Barr said, “That would be a crime.”He also pledged to seek the advice of ethics lawyers in the Justice Department about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia inquiry, while stopping short of committing to accepting their recommendation. Late last year, Justice Department ethics officials recommended to Mr. Whitaker that he recuse himself from overseeing that investigation, but Mr. Whitaker declined to do so.Separately, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced in a letter on Tuesday that Mr. Whitaker had agreed to testify publicly before his committee on Feb. 8, regardless of the status of the border wall impasse or “whether or not the Senate has confirmed a new attorney general.” The hearing promises to be a blockbuster session, and should turn on many of the same questions Mr. Barr faced, including about Mr. Mueller.The fate of Mr. Mueller’s findings — an expected report — was a recurring topic. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller’s report to the attorney general would be “confidential,” but that the attorney general would then produce his own report to Congress based on that material. He said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand jury secrecy rules, but that he would not let the White House edit or change it, as the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had suggested might occur.“That will not happen,” Mr. Barr said.Adam Goldman and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

Howell approved the extension ahead of the scheduled expiration of the grand jury’s term this week.CreditCreditAlex Wong/Getty ImagesBy Sharon LaFraniereJan. 4, 2019WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Washington has extended the term of a grand jury hearing evidence uncovered by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential race and the Trump campaign.The jurors, impaneled in July 2017, will continue to meet for up to six months. Beryl A. Howell, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, approved the extension ahead of the scheduled expiration of the grand jury’s term this week.The extension underscores that Mr. Mueller’s team continues to pursue leads about Russia’s covert effort to influence the results of the 2016 election, and whether anyone in the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow to help Donald J. Trump triumph over Hillary Clinton.The prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller are believed to be writing a report for senior Justice Department officials summarizing their findings, but it is unclear how detailed it will be or how or whether it will be made public, including whether the White House could interfere with its release. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN on Friday, “We will make sure it is public.”Asked whether the evidence so far warrants a congressional effort to impeach Mr. Trump, Mr. Nadler replied, “No, not yet.” He added, “We have to see what the Mueller report says.”Mr. Nadler’s committee plans to speedily seek to question Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general who is now overseeing Mr. Mueller, about whether the special counsel’s inquiry will be free of political interference. The president’s critics fear that he installed Mr. Whitaker in the post to tie prosecutors’ hands.A grand jury’s term typically is limited to 18 months, but it can be extended for up to six months if the court determines that it would serve the public interest.Since Mr. Mueller was appointed in May 2017, the special counsel’s team has secured criminal convictions of a string of former aides to President Trump, including his former campaign chairman, former deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser. Prosecutors have also turned over evidence to United States attorneys in and around Washington and New York, resulting in still more criminal cases.Last month, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former longtime fixer and lawyer, was sentenced to three years in prison in part for lying to Congress about a lucrative hotel deal in Moscow that the Trump Organization pursued while Mr. Trump was running for president. Mr. Cohen also admitted that at Mr. Trump’s direction, he organized hush-money payments to two women whose allegations of extramarital affairs with Mr. Trump might have derailed his presidential campaign.And later in December, the sentencing of the president’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, on his conviction for lying to investigators was postponed after a dramatic court hearing in which a federal judge implied he would sentence Mr. Flynn to prison, expressing “disgust” about his crimes.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Continues Grand Jury Hearing Evidence for Mueller.

Cohen, President Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, was sentenced last month to three years in prison.CreditCreditStephanie Keith for The New York TimesBy Mark Mazzetti and Sharon LaFraniereJan. 18, 2019WASHINGTON — The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate,” said the spokesman, Peter Carr.Before Mr. Carr’s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel’s statement “a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!”A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia’s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel’s office weighed in.“Two words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is ‘categorically false,’” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller’s office disputed the account. “We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he’s disputing,” Mr. Smith said on Twitter.The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohen’s testimony to the special counsel’s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was “already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.”If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations “would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.”Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that “if the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.”Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the project.Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 — before the first presidential primaries — and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump’s family about the negotiations.When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump’s “political messaging.”That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. “There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?” he told reporters.Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.At least one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel’s office said in a December sentencing memo.Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care “not to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation” and provided “useful information” about his contacts with “persons connected to the White House” in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel’s filing said.That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen’s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller’s. Driven by greed, they said, he “repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.”Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said “led me to choose a path of darkness over light.”During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely — or not to testify at all.“Yes,” Mr. Barr said. “Under an obstruction statute, yes.”Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Ben Protess from New York.

Barr, the president’s nominee for attorney general, goes before senators for his confirmation hearing starting Tuesday.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Katie BennerJan. 14, 2019WASHINGTON — William P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, promised on Monday that he would allow the special counsel to continue his investigation, seeking to allay Democrats’ fears that he might shut down the inquiry.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said in written testimony that he plans to deliver on Tuesday at the start of his two-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.“The country needs a credible resolution of these issues,” he added. “If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation.”But Mr. Barr’s written statement also included a subtle caveat, limiting his assurances about the investigation to issues under his control: “I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision,” he wrote.That qualification could be important because Mr. Barr has long advanced a philosophy of strong executive powers under which almost any executive branch decision is ultimately the president’s to make and the president is the nation’s top law-enforcement official, not the attorney general.After Mr. Barr was nominated last month, an unsolicited memo emerged that he had sent to Justice Department officials and the president’s lawyers last year criticizing a focus of the inquiry: whether the president obstructed justice by firing James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in a possible effort to impede the inquiry itself.“Obviously, the president and any other official can commit obstruction in this classic sense of sabotaging a proceeding’s truth-finding function,” Mr. Barr wrote, noting that the president is not exempt from the law.The memo prompted concerns among congressional Democrats that Mr. Barr might stop the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, if Mr. Trump ordered him to do so. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, have called on Mr. Trump in recent days to rescind Mr. Barr’s nomination, saying that his memo disqualifies him to lead the department.In his planned remarks, Mr. Barr said that his memo addressed only the single obstruction-of-justice issue and that he did not argue that a president can never obstruct justice.“The memo did not address — or in any way question — the special counsel’s core investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election,” Mr. Barr planned to say. “I wrote it myself, on my own initiative, without assistance, and based solely on public information.”In his prepared testimony, Mr. Barr also said he would follow the rules governing Mr. Mueller’s appointment and work to allow him to finish the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired with it.“I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work,” Mr. Barr planned to say, according to the prepared remarks.Nonetheless, senators still plan to press Mr. Barr about the memo. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Judiciary committee, said in a letter to Mr. Barr that she plans to ask him why he wrote the memo, who he conferred with in writing it, and exactly who he shared it with.Mr. Barr also said that he would provide as much information to the public as the law allowed about the results of the inquiry.Noting that they worked together at the Justice Department under President George Bush, Mr. Barr planned to say that he has known and respected Mr. Mueller as a colleague and friend for 30 years and that he had confidence that Mr. Mueller would handle the special counsel inquiry properly.Mr. Barr said in his prepared testimony that he reluctantly accepted the nomination out of a sense of civic duty, and that Mr. Trump “has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied.”In a letter of support for Mr. Barr’s nomination, former Justice Department officials including former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and James M. Cole, an Obama administration deputy attorney general, wrote that Mr. Barr, who was attorney general under Mr. Bush, served without “regard to favor or politics.”Mr. Barr will lay out his other priorities at the hearing including clamping down on illegal immigration and ensuring the integrity of elections, according to his prepared remarks. “The attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice — the enforcement of the law — is above and away from politics,” Mr. Barr planned to say.Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

GrynbaumJan. 19, 2019In an age of unyielding appetite for all things Trump, big news travels fast.So when BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that the president had instructed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie in his testimony to Congress — a felony — the assertion ricocheted around the cable TV ecosystem and into the halls of Congress, where Democratic lawmakers publicly mused on impeachment.Unlike past articles on the possible ties between Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, however, this one was not followed by similar stories from other news organizations, who proved unable to corroborate its findings with reporting of their own. And on Friday, the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, broke precedent by issuing a denial, interrupting nearly 20 months of silence from Mr. Mueller on news reports swirling around his investigation.Whether BuzzFeed’s reporting can stand up to further scrutiny is now at the center of a test of the news media’s credibility. President Trump seized on the special counsel’s denial to continue making the case that the press is biased against him. Journalists expressed the worry that a retraction could undermine Americans’ trust in their work.BuzzFeed News said on Saturday that it remained confident in the article and its two authors, one of whom won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2016. “We wouldn’t have published it if we hadn’t felt comfortable with it,” Ben Smith, the site’s editor in chief, said in an interview. “We were careful and thorough.”Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House on Saturday, called the article “a disgrace to our country.” He added, “It’s going to take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility.”The episode underscored the risks and temptations that go with reporting on the legal labyrinth of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, the outcome of which may help determine the fate of Mr. Trump’s presidency.BuzzFeed’s findings were attributed to two unnamed federal law enforcement officers with knowledge of the special counsel’s investigation. One of the reporters, Anthony Cormier, said on CNN that he had not reviewed the underlying documents, but that the two sources had, and they were “fully, 100 percent read-in to that aspect of the special counsel’s investigation.”Mr. Cormier and his co-writer, Jason Leopold, have written well-received investigative articles on Mr. Trump and a Moscow tower project that involved President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The latest piece, though, was more dramatic in reporting that Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project and that Mr. Mueller’s office was aware of this conduct.The BuzzFeed article was the talk of TV pundits and news websites for 24 hours — until Peter Carr, Mr. Mueller’s spokesman, weighed in. Mr. Carr, whose stoicism is so well-known in Washington that he has the nickname “Mr. No-Comment,” wrote: “BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate.”Several reporters who cover the Justice Department said they interpreted the statement as a full denial of BuzzFeed’s conclusions. Mr. Smith, in the interview, said the wording of Mr. Carr’s statement was imprecise, adding that he was “eager to understand” which specific aspects of the article the special counsel’s office had denied. Asked if the statement had caught him by surprise, Mr. Smith replied, “You always have to be ready for everything in this business.”BuzzFeed News, the reporting division of a website better known for viral videos and quizzes, has scrambled for respect and recognition since its founding eight years ago. Under the direction of Mr. Smith, a longtime political journalist, the site has pursued ambitious stories. Last year it was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for an inquiry into the deaths of Russians in England, which Mr. Leopold worked on.BuzzFeed’s longtime investigative editor, Mark Schoofs, left in October for an academic post at the University of Southern California. His replacement, Heidi Blake, who is based in London, edited the Cohen piece, along with Mr. Smith and Ariel Kaminer, a senior investigations editor, both of whom are based in New York.This is not the site’s first brush with controversy. In January 2017, Mr. Smith was the first editor to publish the explosive, but unverified, dossier compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign. Besides earning ire from the White House, and some scolding from media ethicists, the site was also sued for libel by Mr. Cohen in a case that was later dropped. Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of BuzzFeed in a separate dossier-related lawsuit.Mr. Leopold, who is based in Los Angeles and known for his mastery of Freedom of Information laws, has a self-described “checkered past” in journalism that includes retracted reporting and accusations of plagiarism. In 2006, he reported for TruthOut.org, a liberal website, that Karl Rove, a senior adviser to then-president George W. Bush, would soon be indicted; the story proved false. Mr. Leopold has also spoken openly about his recovery from addiction. Asked about Mr. Leopold’s past, Mr. Smith pointed to his Pulitzer Prize nomination last year.The contentiousness over the recent BuzzFeed article is unlikely to abate soon.Its central assertion pleased many liberals impatient for Mr. Mueller to release his findings. Democratic lawmakers were quick to write on Twitter that, “if true,” the article’s findings could lead to impeachment. In covering the reaction to its own scoop, BuzzFeed ran the headline, “More And More Democrats Are Suggesting Trump Should Be Impeached After He Told His Lawyer Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress.”The cold water of Mr. Carr’s denial led some journalists to cringe on-air in real time. “This is a bad day for us,” the CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Friday, after his network had devoted many segments to dissecting the piece. “It reinforces every bad stereotype about the news media.”The president’s son, Donald J. Trump Jr., a relentless media critic, responded in his own way, on Twitter: “Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!”One side effect of the BuzzFeed article was that it made for a rare moment of agreement between the president and the man who has been investigating him.“I appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. “I think it was very appropriate that they did so. I very much appreciate that.”Correction: Jan. 20, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the month that Mark Schoofs, BuzzFeed’s longtime investigative editor, left the organization.

MaybeAdvertisementSupported byWill We Ever See Mueller’s Report on Trump? MaybeImagePresident Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, William P. Barr, said at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he wanted to release as much of what the special counsel found as possible.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Michael S. Schmidt and Charlie SavageJan. 16, 2019WASHINGTON — The swirl of speculation surrounding the Russia investigation often assumes that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will release a report of his findings that will serve as the definitive explanation of how Russia interfered in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his associates coordinated with Moscow.But there is no such guarantee. The law does not require the Justice Department to release a report, and Mr. Mueller has been silent on the issue. Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, said at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he wanted to release as much of what Mr. Mueller found as possible. But he said he needed to learn more about the report and the regulations that govern his releasing information from it before deciding what to do about disclosing the findings.That answer did not satisfy leading Senate Democrats, who said on Wednesday that they would oppose Mr. Barr’s nomination unless he agreed to release the entire report Mr. Mueller produces, except for redactions of sensitive national security information.Why do people assume that a Mueller report is coming?Because the government has issued plenty of big reports after important investigations into national catastrophes and scandals. Commissions that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction after the invasion of Iraq, for example, produced book-length public reports that became part of the historical record.Similarly, Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton over the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals, gave Congress a long report that lawmakers voted to make public. It provided a detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details, and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president.That does not always happen. Nearly a half-century ago, the special counsel investigating President Richard M. Nixon over the Watergate scandal, Leon Jaworski, had a grand jury send to Congress a terse report containing spare factual statements with citations of evidence and no legal analysis. This report, known as the “Road Map,” was kept secret until last year.But Mr. Mueller is working under a different set of rules than any of those investigators.What do the current rules say?In 1999, partly in reaction to perceptions that Mr. Starr had overreached, Congress let the independent counsel law expire. The Justice Department wrote new regulations allowing for special counsels who can investigate high-level executive-branch wrongdoing with some day-to-day independence but ultimately under the supervision of the attorney general.The officials who wrote the regulations sought to prevent the sort of “extravagant” steps Mr. Starr had taken in writing his report, according to Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official who drafted the rules.“There is no doubt that when you are writing regs like that in the midst of a really public thing like the Starr Report, it’s going to influence your thinking, and definitely it did,” he said. “There were concerns about the privacy violations that occurred in the Starr Report.”The regulation instructs Mr. Mueller to give the attorney general “a confidential report” when he has finished his investigation explaining his decisions about whom to prosecute and whom not to charge. The attorney general, in turn, must send a report to Congress explaining why the work has concluded. The attorney general is also free to decide that issuing that report would be in the public interest, as long as it is released lawfully.The Justice Department’s explanation of the special counsel regulations, filed in the Federal Register in 1999, criticized the old independent counsel law’s system where prosecutors filed reports directly to Congress that typically were made public, as in the Starr investigation.Instead, officials called for special counsels to write confidential summaries to the attorney general about their charging decisions and for the attorney general’s report to Congress to be a “brief notification” that the investigation was closed and why.To be sure, Mr. Mueller has already disclosed significant investigative findings by writing and unsealing lengthy narrative indictments, especially of Russians involved in the operations to manipulate American social media and hack Democratic emails. But that method has limited value for understanding the actions of people he does not indict.How the Mueller Investigation Could Play Out for TrumpIf Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.How does Barr view the issue?He has said he is still trying to figure it out.While Mr. Barr repeatedly emphasized that he wants to make public as much information as he can about the special counsel investigation, he stopped short of making commitments — emphasizing that certain rules might hamstring him and that he had not yet been briefed on Mr. Mueller’s investigation. He also said he wanted to speak to Mr. Mueller and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed the special counsel, to see what they were already thinking.“I don’t know what, at the end of the day, what will be releasable,” he said at his confirmation hearing. “I don’t know what Bob Mueller is writing.”Mr. Barr left open possibilities including drafting his own summary of the findings, should he be confirmed as attorney general, as expected.“There are different reports at work here,” Mr. Barr said. “Under the current regulations, the special counsel report is confidential, and the report that goes public would be a report by the attorney general.”That answer failed to placate Democrats and left confusion about his ultimate intentions. On Wednesday, one of the witnesses at his hearing, Neil Kinkopf, a Georgia State University law professor and former Justice Department official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, flagged the ambiguity with concern, saying Mr. Barr seemed to be interpreting the regulation to mean that the attorney general should release his own report, not turn over Mr. Mueller’s.What information might Barr withhold?Whether Mr. Barr ends up relaying a redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report or instead writes his own, he most likely will have to keep grand jury testimony secret.He also may withhold classified information that could reveal intelligence sources and methods still being used to spy on the Russian government, like any moles or wiretaps.Mr. Barr also noted that the Justice Department typically keeps confidential so-called declination memos where prosecutors explain what they uncovered about anyone they decide not to prosecute.On Wednesday, Mr. Kinkopf noted that the Justice Department had taken the position that sitting presidents could not be indicted while in office. If Mr. Barr strictly enforces the view that department policy forbids putting out negative information about people whom prosecutors declined to charge, he said, that would prevent Justice Department officials from releasing information about Mr. Trump’s actions.Mr. Katyal said there was one way around that. The special counsel regulation requires Mr. Barr to tell Congress about any instance in which he overruled a step Mr. Mueller proposed, so if Mr. Mueller were to suggest indicting Mr. Trump, the attorney general report would have to discuss that.How else can we find out what Mueller learned?For one thing, information could leak to the news media. If any Mueller report is leaked, that would most likely cause a firestorm, especially if it contained unredacted classified information and evidence subject to grand-jury secrecy rules.The House Judiciary Committee, now controlled by Democrats, could also seek to subpoena the report. If Mr. Trump asserts executive privilege to avoid turning it over, the House could ask a judge to order it handed over.House Democrats could similarly seek to subpoena Mr. Mueller to testify about his findings. Mr. Trump could also seek to gag Mr. Mueller by invoking executive privilege, although it is not clear that he would succeed.Could Trump block or edit a report to Congress?The president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested that in addition to potentially invoking executive privilege, the White House may seek to edit a report that will go to Congress “so we can correct it if they’re wrong.”Mr. Barr said on Tuesday that he would not allow such a move: “That will not happen.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Months in the Making, Much Talked About and It Might Never Be Public.

The prince was unhurt, but the crash injured two women in another vehicle.CreditCreditDylan Bailey, via ReutersBy Benjamin MuellerJan. 18, 2019LONDON — Prince Philip was at the wheel?To the astonishment and alarm of some Britons, he was. At age 97. On a public road, alone. And, on Thursday afternoon, straight into the path of a minivan hurtling down a motorway with a 9-month-old boy inside.The crash flipped the armor-plated Land Rover driven by Prince Philip. The minivan careened off the road.Prince Philip and the child were unhurt, though a minivan passenger broke her wrist and the driver suffered knee cuts. The prince told police officers he had been “dazzled by the sun,” a witness said.Still, some Britons were confused over why the prince, the wizened and gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh who is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was even driving.“You’d have to be a superhero for your mental acuity not to have slowed down,” said Inger Wallis, a Bloomsbury resident out walking her dog on Friday.She shook her head as she repeated his age, while acknowledging her “deep respect” for the supporting role he has played for so many decades beside Elizabeth. Ms. Wallis’s own father, she said, hung up the keys at 84, scared to drive.If nothing else, Britons could be thankful that, for one day at least, the agony of Britain’s tortured withdrawal from the European Union was not the leading topic of discussion.The crash, involving a famously headstrong and famously old royal, did provoke a lively discussion about whether Britain should stop older people from driving. The country will have a million drivers older than 85 by 2025, doubled from a few years ago. And those drivers are more vulnerable to crash injuries because of their frailty.That Prince Philip was unaccompanied in the Land Rover by his round-the-clock bodyguards or royal chauffeurs also drew attention to an inconvenient fact, for those who have ever tried to pry the keys from older relatives.ImageThe Obamas and Queen Elizabeth II arriving at the Sovereign’s Entrance in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle driven by Prince Philip, in 2016.CreditPool photo by Geoff PughDriving is a lifeline for some older people, especially in Britain, where smaller towns and rural areas have scant public transit. And older drivers are, by many measures, safer drivers, with people older than 70 half as likely as drivers 25 and younger to kill a pedestrian, the Older Drivers Task Force in Britain said in 2016.[When is it time to stop driving? For families everywhere, an all-too-familiar question.]If the government is to take anyone’s keys, experts said, it should target young men.Arthur Currie, 70, a resident at the Royal Hospital Chelsea for veterans of the British Army, said his relatives sit more stiffly in the passenger seat when he gets behind the wheel. “Or they will say to me, ‘You see that car coming, Daddy?’” he said. But when they broach the topic of him giving up his keys altogether, Mr. Currie makes his view clear.“My first reaction is looking at them and giving them what they call a laser stare,” he said. “Being an ex-regimental sergeant major, I have perfected the laser stare.”Mr. Currie said his only thought, upon hearing about the crash, was concern for Prince Philip and the others involved. As an honorary colonel of the Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars, where Mr. Currie was once a sergeant major, the prince made annual visits to the troops.“If he felt he was able enough to drive, who am I or who’s anybody else to say he shouldn’t be driving?” Mr. Currie said.Not all Britons were so deferential.John Clegg, manning the register at the London Review Bookshop, wondered why the prince could not simply get his driving fix on the private roads of his vast royal estates.“What’s the point in going around in a Land Rover unless you’re going to go off road?” he asked. (Not the most pressing question, perhaps, regarding the solo driving by a 97-year-old royal.)Mr. Clegg said his grandmother finally persuaded his grandfather to stop driving after too many instances of having to shake him awake.“He never went off the road, but she could see when it could happen,” Mr. Clegg said.The prince is regarded a bit warily by the British public. He is known to be hardheaded and occasionally gruff, and to make racist and sexist comments, including ones about Chinese with “slitty” eyes and women who cannot cook.Ingrid Seward, a royals expert whose latest book is “My Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of the Royal Marriage,” suspected the prince would stubbornly resist the queen’s admonitions about his driving, but would see the logic and could be persuaded to give it up.ImageQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip last year. The Duke of Edinburgh is widely known as stubborn, occasionally gruff and gaffe prone.CreditAlastair Grant/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“It is the lobotomy of his last vestige of independence,” Ms. Seward said.Like many others, Ms. Seward has her own experience trying, with some difficulty, to persuade a parent to relinquish the keys. At 86, her mother took a driving test in an attempt to defy Ms. Seward and prove she could still drive. She failed.Ms. Seward said Prince Philip may have been alone in the Land Rover because he was only driving from one side of his Sandringham Estate to another. A few years ago, the Obamas got into the car with Prince Philip on the same estate, and looked somewhat less than at ease.Prince Philip was known to prize fast sports cars, and the British news media quickly dug up
examples of his reckless driving, including one accident in 1996 in which he rear-ended a car at a pedestrian crossing, leaving the driver in a neck brace. As far back as the 1950s, a British tabloid questioned whether he should be trusted to drive the queen around.On Thursday afternoon, he was pulling off a private road and either onto or across a public motorway known for accidents, with its 60 mile-per-hour speed limit and scary bends. Local lawmakers, who coincidentally met on Friday to discuss the road’s safety, lowered the speed to 50 m.p.h.As the British tabloids chronicled in graphic cartoon mock-ups of the crash site, the prince’s car turned over, he was rescued through the sunroof, and had to submit to a breathalyzer test.Hugh Bladon, 77, a spokesman for the Alliance of British Drivers and a proud older driver, said another alliance member familiar with the road had told him he could understand how the sun may have blinded the prince.“Obviously, everyone’s going to jump on the age bandwagon,” he said. “But age actually is nothing to do with skill.”British law requires drivers at age 70 to start self-reporting medical issues related to their fitness for the road every three years. The Older Drivers Task Force recommended the government raise the age to 75, but also start requiring an eyesight test, a more accurate barometer of any problems.Britain instituted driving tests only in 1935, but it is unclear if Prince Philip, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took one. The royal palace, though, confirmed on Friday that he had a license. The queen, on the other hand, as the person in whose name British licenses are issued, is the only Briton who can drive without one.British lawyers said there was a chance Prince Philip could be charged with driving without due care and attention, though he could also possibly avoid charges by voluntarily surrendering his license.There were hints on Friday, though, that the prince would not give up quite so easily. A replacement Land Rover was seen by British photographers being driven onto the grounds of his estate, under the watchful eye of the police.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: After a Crash, Prince Philip, 97, Ignites a Debate About Older Drivers.

But his party membership is mostly pro-European.CreditCreditNeil Hall/EPA, via ShutterstockBy Benjamin MuellerJan. 16, 2019LONDON — Just minutes after Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union was resoundingly defeated on Tuesday night, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, rose in Parliament and vowed in thunderous tones to unseat her.For Mr. Corbyn, a soft-spoken outsider who stormed to the top of the opposition party three years ago, the moment marked a crossroads. After years of lying low on the question of Brexit, he finally made his move, thrusting himself into the center of the debate. He demanded a no-confidence vote, considered the first step in having to choose a side in the Brexit debate.In the end, Mrs. May clung to power as lawmakers beat back the challenge against her. But Mr. Corbyn has still emerged with an enormous amount of influence to shape the Brexit battle moving forward.Not only did Mrs. May barely survive the no-confidence vote in the House of Commons, she also suffered the worst parliamentary defeat in Britain since the 19th century the day before, when her plan for carrying out Brexit failed 432 to 202, with more than 100 of her own party members deserting her.Mr. Corbyn’s Labour Party, on the other hand, suffered only three defections in Tuesday’s vote. Now any path forward will probably depend on votes from the opposition, especially the Labour Party.“I don’t see any feasible majority for any outcome to this process that doesn’t involve a substantial number of Labour voters being committed to supporting it,” said Robert Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester.VideoAfter Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan was rejected by Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called for a motion of no confidence.CreditCreditMark Duffy/British Parliament, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe biggest question now is what Mr. Corbyn will do with his power. He has long avoided defining a stance on how or whether to leave the European Union for fear of upsetting either pro- or anti-Brexit voters who could help bring his Labour Party back into a leadership role. But pressure is mounting for him now to take a stand.If he chooses to back a “soft” Brexit maintaining close ties with the European Union, that proposal would probably pass. If he backs a second referendum that could thwart Brexit altogether, that would have at least a chance of passing. If he stands aside and lets Labour lawmakers back a version of Mrs. May’s deal, that, too, would be likely to pass.The choice is not easy. The debate over Brexit within the Labour Party, while milder than the warfare among Mrs. May’s Conservatives, is dangerously divisive. And to achieve his ultimate goal of returning Labour to power and reversing decades of neoliberal policies, Mr. Corbyn needs a united party.That presents him with a dilemma. As a lifelong critic of the European Union, which he has portrayed as a bankers’ club that blocks left-wing policies, Mr. Corbyn is loath to reverse Brexit and anger working-class Labour voters who opted to leave. But the Labour activists who powered his unlikely leadership bid are putting enormous pressure on him to do just that.The predicament mirrors questions confronting left-wing parties in Europe and the United States about how to fight populist movements that trade on anti-immigrant sentiment.Should they stand up for open borders and multiculturalism and risk cutting loose white workers who have drifted to the anti-immigrant right? Or try winning back those voters with a liberal version of the fight against global institutions, trade pacts and migration?ImageMr. Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May, center, as soon as her Brexit proposal was defeated on Tuesday night.CreditJessica Taylor/House of Commons, via Associated Press“If you look around Europe, center-left parties are facing a dilemma,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, who has surveyed Labour membership on Brexit. “How do they maintain or even get back an electoral coalition of workers and middle-class, more educated voters?”The daunting electoral math facing Labour has given Mr. Corbyn reasons for remaining vague.At the most recent general election, in 2017, the party achieved unexpected victories in prosperous, pro-European parts of England. But if it is to form a government after the next election — scheduled for 2022, should Mrs. May’s government survive until then — it would also need the support of pro-Brexit voters in small towns who remained loyal to the Conservatives last time.Mr. Corbyn rose to the edge of power by presenting himself as an authentic, left-wing champion of grass-roots Labour members. With a majority of those members now wanting to let the British people vote again on Brexit, it is increasingly untenable for Mr. Corbyn to avoid a decision.“The danger here is that the shine is coming off the Corbyn project because of his triangulation on Brexit,” said Michael Chessum of Another Europe Is Possible, a left-wing group campaigning for Labour leaders to back a second Brexit referendum. “If people start to think that Corbyn is just another politician like all the other politicians, that is the thing that will kill the Corbyn project.”But Mr. Corbyn also has allies within Labour cheering his strategy of not taking any particular side. Like him, they rank membership in the European Union low among their priorities, below the goals of ending austerity and pulling Britons out of poverty.“Brexit is actually a relatively small issue compared to the social issues facing this country,” said Callum Cant, a Labour member and Corbyn backer. “Regardless of people’s position on the E.U., we need to fight together for a larger project of social transformation.”ImageA protester folding European Union flags after the vote on Tuesday. A recent poll shows Labour support falling to a fifth of voters in the next general election if it backs Brexit, or roughly a third if it campaigns for a second referendum.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersA recent poll showed that Labour would have the support of roughly one-fifth of voters if it backed Brexit, and close to 40 percent if the party instead campaigned for a second referendum.Even in seats that voted to leave the European Union, it is essential that Labour keep the backing of pro-Europeans, who are more likely to be in the party’s camp, said Professor Ford at the University of Manchester. And winning swing voters does not necessarily mean caving to anti-immigrant sentiment, he said.“In a strange sort of way, the anti-immigration side winning at least temporarily seems to have the paradoxical effect of shifting opinion the other way,” he said.While Labour Party members have largely stuck behind Mr. Corbyn so far, they overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, and nearly three-quarters would like a rerun, according to a study led by Professor Bale.Thousands of them have submitted notes recently to a group that includes top lawmakers, some of them threatening to leave the party over Brexit and describing “despair” over Mr. Corbyn’s months of equivocating. Pro-European party activists have circulated a resolution saying Labour should demand a second referendum and campaign to stay in the bloc; up to 200 local parties are expected to debate it by the end of the month.Could Mr. Corbyn defy them and vote through a Brexit plan? Grace Blakeley, another Labour member, said Mr. Corbyn would never explicitly support a government Brexit proposal, but might watch as Labour lawmakers defected to get behind such a deal.She described the Labour leader’s strategy as angling for a populist movement that could win over pro-Brexit voters not by accommodating anti-immigrant views, but by making an economic argument for overturning the status quo.On the left, she said, the most successful campaigns of recent years in Europe and elsewhere have taken “the existing economic anger and, rather than mobilizing it against migrants, mobilize it against elites and the establishment that have rigged the economy.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Labour Party Leader Exerts Influence Over What Happens With Brexit.

So I am glad to make this policy change.”CreditCreditAlastair Grant/Associated PressBy Benjamin MuellerJan. 10, 2019LONDON — British women forced into marriages abroad will no longer be required to repay the government for the cost of helping them escape, according to the foreign secretary, reversing a policy that touched off intense public outrage.Instead, the government will use court orders to try to recover expenses for parts of the women’s rescue, like flights home and short-term shelter, from the people who sent them abroad — often their parents. If those efforts are unsuccessful, the Foreign Office will cover the costs itself.“Our treatment of vulnerable Britons abroad should always be guided by compassion,” the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said in a letter on Tuesday. “So I am glad to make this policy change.”The repayment policy, which applied to women of age 18 or older, was an extension of the government’s approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need consular help returning to the United Kingdom.But charities that support survivors of forced marriages said the policy had ignored the unusually risky position those women were in. They often had to ask family members for help cobbling together the money, forcing them to turn to some of the same people who had coerced them into the marriages in the first place.Those who could not get help from relatives or friends had to sign emergency loan agreements before the British government would send them back home. They also had to forfeit their passports until the repayments were complete, and faced a 10 percent surcharge on anything they owed after six months.Under the policy, detailed in
articles in The Times of London last week, four British women were each charged roughly $900 for the government’s efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where, they said, they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women’s families had sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.The biggest number of forced marriage cases was in Pakistan. In all, the Foreign Office helped bring home 82 survivors over 2016 and 2017. Mr. Hunt said that “only a small minority” had to sign loan agreements with the government; the rest, he said, were able to find others to pay the fees.Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Commons, wrote a letter to Mr. Hunt last week challenging the repayment policy. “Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are deeply concerned that victims may be forced to pay for their own rescue or, worse, may be dissuaded from asking for help if they have not got the funds,” it said.Mr. Hunt said in his reply to Mr. Tugendhat that women with outstanding loans would not have to pay any more, and that the government would return any passports that had been blocked pending repayment.“Whereas the Foreign Office rightly expects that adult Britons who receive consular assistance will, in general, pay for their own travel home, victims of forced marriage may have endured particular suffering,” Mr. Hunt said in his letter.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: U.K. Drops Policy of Fee For Women After Rescue.

The Foreign Office has been criticized for its policy of charging young women for their rescue from forced marriages.CreditCreditTolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Benjamin MuellerJan. 2, 2019LONDON — It is a punishing coda to an already awful ordeal: British women who survive forced marriages abroad are rescued with help from the Foreign Office, only to have to repay the government for their escape.And if they fail to cobble together a repayment that can reach nearly $1,000 within six months, the Foreign Office adds a 10 percent surcharge on anything they still owe. For some women, that means using university loans or public benefit funds for their flight home.Those disclosures, made in a series of articles in The Times of London in recent days, have spurred outrage in Parliament and drawn a promise from the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Wednesday that he would solicit fresh advice on the policy.“Of course, we should always behave with compassion and humanity in every situation,” he said in a radio interview, “but I want to get to the bottom of this particular issue.”The Foreign Office helped bring home 27 survivors of forced marriages in 2017 and 55 the year before, according to government figures obtained by The Times of London under freedom of information laws. The biggest number of cases was in Pakistan, and not every woman required government loans to fly home to Britain.Aisha K. Gill, a professor of criminology at the University of Roehampton who has written extensively about forced marriage, said the punitive loans undermined the work of the British government to help rescue survivors.“In my view, protection shouldn’t have a price tag,” she said in an interview. “They should not be punished for seeking protection from the consulate.”Professor Gill said the fact that such a policy exists speaks to people’s tendency to diminish the coercion and abuse that are central to forced marriages.The government intervenes on behalf of people who are imprisoned abroad without asking for payment, Ms. Gill said. But the fact that many of the survivors of forced marriages are immigrants, or come from families that recently immigrated, she added, seemed to make them less sympathetic in the public’s eye.The government’s repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.That age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.After that, 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy.The Times of London reported on four British women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government’s efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women’s families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.Ayaan, 24, who had been at the institution for two years, said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued.“I was left to fend for myself,” she told The Times of London. “The loan has caused so much anxiety.”Just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.“It’s an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability,” she said.A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said in a statement: “We recognize that an emergency loan can help remove a distressed or vulnerable person from risk when they have no other options, but as they are from public funds we have an obligation to recover the money in due course.”The spokeswoman said the government also gives money to safe houses and other organizations that do not charge British survivors of forced marriages for help finding them a place of safety.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain Bills Women Freed From Forced Marriages.

David Ake/Associated PressBy Adam LiptakJan. 8, 2019WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused on Tuesday to intercede in a mysterious fight over a sealed grand jury subpoena to a foreign corporation issued by a federal prosecutor who may or may not be Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump-Russia affair.The court’s action means the corporation, which has not been identified, must provide information to the prosecutor or face financial penalties. The court’s two-sentence order gave no reasons and provided no details.Almost everything about the case has been cloaked in secrecy. But a three-page order issued on Dec. 18 and a more detailed opinion studded with blacked-out passages issued on Tuesday after the Supreme Court acted, both from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, provided a few hints.Judges David S. Tatel and Thomas B. Griffith joined the appeals court’s unsigned majority opinion, and Judge Stephen F. Williams agreed with the outcome but not all of the majority’s reasoning.An unnamed foreign government, referred to in the rulings as Country A, owns the corporation, the panel said.The appeals court rejected the corporation’s argument that it could not be forced to comply with the subpoena under a federal law that provides immunity from lawsuits to foreign governments in some circumstances. Even if that law applied to cases concerning grand jury subpoenas, the panel ruled, the law makes an exception for foreign governments’ commercial activities.The panel also rejected the corporation’s argument that the subpoena was “unreasonable and oppressive” because complying with it would require the corporation to violate one of its home country’s laws.“The text of the foreign law provision the corporation relies on does not support its position,” the panel wrote, adding that explanations from the corporation’s lawyers and “a regulator from Country A” were unpersuasive.“Consequently,” the panel wrote, “we are unconvinced that Country A’s law truly prohibits the Corporation from complying with the subpoena.”The appeals court’s opinion affirmed a sealed ruling by Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington that had held the corporation in contempt and imposed a fine of $50,000 per day until it complied with the subpoena.On Dec. 22, in a sealed filing, the corporation asked the Supreme Court to stay Judge Howell’s ruling. The next day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. temporarily put the matter on hold, ordering the government to file a response by Dec. 31. In the meantime, he wrote, the penalties imposed by Judge Howell would not mount.Such administrative stays issued by a single justice are usually meant to do no more than maintain the status quo while the full court considers what to do in the case.Tuesday’s order vacated the chief justice’s temporary stay.There is nothing in public court documents indicating that the prosecutor involved is Mr. Mueller. But the case has involved unusual secrecy even by the standards of grand jury subpoenas.When the appeals court heard arguments behind closed doors, security officers cleared an entire floor of the courthouse so that reporters could not see who the lawyers were as they went in and exited.Politico wrote in October that one of its reporters had overheard an unidentified lawyer in the appeals court clerk’s office asking to see a sealed filing from the special counsel so his law firm could draft its response. The exchange with the man, who refused to identify himself, took place on the same day that a sealed filing was due in the mystery case.And CNN has said that its reporters twice saw a team of lawyers working for Mr. Mueller, including Michael Dreeben, an appellate specialist, going into a sealed courtroom to argue before Judge Howell against an unknown litigant, including on a day when she later handed down a ruling in the sealed case.

Heathrow reported on Wednesday that operations were normal.Flights at Heathrow are operating normally. Our focus is always the safety of our passengers and colleagues and we apologise to those passengers whose journeys have been unfairly affected this evening.— Heathrow Airport (@HeathrowAirport) January 8, 2019
The latest airport closing demonstrates how vulnerable the air transport system is to relatively low-cost interference, or even just the threat of it. Aviation officials fear that a drone could be sucked into a jet engine and disable it, as has happened with birds.The person or people behind the Gatwick closing of Dec. 19 to 21, at the height of the holiday travel season, have not been caught.“We are deploying significant resources — both in terms of officers and equipment — to monitor the airspace around Heathrow and to quickly detect and disrupt any illegal drone activity,” Cmdr. Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan Police said in a statement late Tuesday. “Following today’s sighting, military assistance has been implemented to support us.”Some of the anti-drone practices they will use stem from lessons learned at Gatwick, he said. But he declined to elaborate, adding, “We will not be discussing in any further detail the range of tactics available to us as this would only serve to potentially undermine their effectiveness.”Chris Grayling, Britain’s transport secretary, said Tuesday night that the military would deploy the same equipment at Heathrow that it had used at Gatwick, “should it prove necessary,” but he, too, declined to elaborate. He said he had spoken to the home and defense secretaries and was in contact with Heathrow officials.Anti-drone proposals have included jamming the devices’ navigation signals, cannon that fire small nets to ensnare drones, snipers to shoot them, and even eagles trained to bring them down.Putting to rest any suspicion that the sightings at Heathrow, about 15 miles west of central London, were false alarms, Commander Cundy said, “Police officers were amongst those who saw the drone and a full criminal investigation has been launched.”The Metropolitan Police, which investigates cases believed to involve terrorism throughout Britain, played a secondary role behind the Sussex Police in investigating the Gatwick case, because officials never determined whether it might be terrorism. That prompted calls from some lawmakers for the Metropolitan force to take over the investigation, particularly after two suspects were arrested by the Sussex Police, but then cleared and exonerated.Operating a drone within a kilometer of an airport is illegal, but aviation security experts have called for an exclusion radius of five kilometers, or about three miles.The partial shutdown on Tuesday was all the more dispiriting because it came only days after Heathrow and Gatwick announced they had ordered military-grade anti-drone equipment to ward off incursions. Both airports have declined to say what the new technology is, or what anti-drone measures they already had in place.A spokeswoman for Gatwick told British news outlets that its new system had been installed and that it matched the capability of the military, which deployed at the airport during the shutdown there. The airport said it had spent several million pounds to purchase the equipment.It was not clear whether Heathrow had already installed its new defense system. The airport was said by a person briefed on its security to have some limited anti-drone technology in place before the Gatwick incursions.A BBC producer, speaking on Tuesday from a plane that was waiting to take off from Heathrow, told the network that passengers on her flight had not been given a reason for the delay. “At the moment,” she said, “we’ve been told we’re not going anywhere.”Heathrow handles more than 75 million passengers a year, the most in Europe by a wide margin. Gatwick, south of London, handles more than 40 million.The Gatwick closing started on the evening of Dec. 19. The airport reopened for short periods the next day, only to be shut down again after fresh sightings. The closings finally ended on the morning of Dec. 21.In all, the airport was out of action for more than 30 hours, and the travel of about 140,000 people was disrupted.Palko Karasz contributed reporting.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Jan. 12, 2019ImageWilliam Barr met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesThe Senate has some tough questions to ask of William Barr this week before voting on confirming him as the next attorney general. Not only has Mr. Barr already come perilously close to reassuring Mr. Trump that the president did not obstruct justice by trying to derail the investigation into whether his campaign conspired with Russia to corrupt the 2016 election, and that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was overreaching, but he also has a long history of advancing an aggressive, expansive conception of presidential power.He has made the case that a president can resist congressional oversight — a convenient position for Mr. Trump, but a concerning one for the country, now that Democrats are in charge of the House. He’s even seen no problem with the president investigating a political opponent, saying there would be more validity in investigating Hillary Clinton for a uranium deal the government approved while she was secretary of state — which she had nothing to do with — than there was in investigating whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia.This theory of executive power has long been prized in conservative legal circles. But it will only empower a chief executive who has fought oversight since his first days in office and has rued the day that the special counsel was appointed after his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia investigation.Mr. Barr cast further doubts about his appointment when he freelanced a memorandum to the Trump administration saying that the steps the president has continually taken to stymie a criminal probe he’s detested — firing the F.B.I. director James Comey, threatening to pardon associates who might cooperate with Mr. Mueller, or even using his “authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding” — were constitutionally legitimate. “Mueller’s obstruction theory,” he wrote, “would do lasting damage to the presidency.”Given these past statements, it would be best if Mr. Barr, too, recused himself. But with the impending departure of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr. Mueller and oversaw his investigation after Mr. Sessions’s recusal, it’s not clear if the inquiry would be any better protected in other hands. There should be tremendous pressure on Mr. Barr to allow Mr. Mueller free rein, both in investigating and in writing a final report. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Barr assured him that he doesn’t think the special counsel is conducting a witch hunt and that he’d aim for transparency whenever Mr. Mueller delivers to him a final report on the special counsel investigation.But is that assurance enough? And if Justice Department ethics officials conclude that Mr. Barr ought to cede supervision of the probe to avoid the “appearance” of bias, as they concluded in the case of the acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, will Mr. Barr simply ignore them, as did Mr. Whitaker?Mr. Barr recommended that President George H.W. Bush pardon Reagan administration officials convicted or implicated in the Iran-contra scandal, including former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Would he object to Mr. Trump pardoning his former national security adviser Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort, whom Mr. Mueller has accused of giving polling data to an associate connected to Russian intelligence? Mr. Trump has certainly considered it.These are not the only subjects senators should pursue with Mr. Barr. He holds the same hard-line views on immigration and criminal justice that once endeared Mr. Sessions to the president. And as the Justice Department has declined to crack down on discriminatory police departments, reversed course as protector of voting rights and abdicated its role in the defense of the Affordable Care Act, morale in its ranks has taken a hit. Just last week, a former lawyer with the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, an elite office that gives legal and policy advice to the president, wrote in The Washington Post that she had resigned after she no longer could give legal cover to the White House’s actions. What are Mr. Barr’s plans to earn back the trust of these public servants and stand up for the rule of law?But it is Mr. Barr’s approach to the investigation of the president that demands the most scrutiny. Under his view that the president controls Justice Department functions and can “start or stop a law enforcement proceeding,” he may well be committed to the idea that the president can do as he wishes with the Mueller investigation. Would he be willing to resign if Mr. Trump tried to shut that investigation down, as Attorney General Elliot Richardson did when President Richard Nixon ordered him to fire the Watergate special prosecutor?At the very least, Mr. Barr can commit to standing up for the integrity of the office he aspires to hold. Despite the partial government shutdown, Mr. Mueller’s investigators continue to move ahead. And federal prosecutors in New York, Virginia and Washington remain hard at work, bringing cases that have arisen out of Mr. Mueller’s probe or that otherwise incriminate subjects at the center of it.This commitment to justice serves as an example to all and ought to go on unimpeded.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR8 of the New York edition with the headline: With Barr, Will Justice Be Done?.

By Kenneth W. StarrMr. Starr was the independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation.Jan. 16, 2019ImageWilliam Barr at the confirmation hearing on Tuesday for his appointment as attorney general. CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesAfter the stormy tenure of Jeff Sessions as attorney general, the likely return of William Barr to the job — which he held with distinction under President George H.W. Bush — has been greeted with sighs of relief at the Justice Department. The reason is not hard to divine: Bill Barr is an accomplished lawyer with a deep respect for the law and for the integrity and independence of the department — something I know from having served under him. After his solid performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, he seems almost certain to be approved by the full Senate. His critics have focused on a 19-page legal memorandum he sent over the summer to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein questioning whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, could investigate the president for violating criminal obstruction-of-justice laws. Democrats have demanded that if confirmed, Mr. Barr should recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller inquiry. But that response to Mr. Barr’s meticulous legal analysis is wildly overwrought. A more dispassionate review of Mr. Barr’s memo shows that he was trying to prevent an unprecedented expansion of a federal criminal statute intended to prevent crimes such as destroying evidence, bribing prospective jurors, intimidating witnesses and the like. The memorandum expressly acknowledges that presidents, like other citizens, can run afoul of the criminal laws. But he questions whether a president can be investigated for actions that are expressly within his constitutional powers — such as firing an F.B.I. director. He is sounding a clear warning against prosecutorial overreach.Indeed, one of Mr. Mueller’s senior prosecutors was a primary architect of a legal theory of obstruction that was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court, a rebuff delivered only after the prosecution caused the collapse of a major accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. That example does not stand alone. In case after case, a wary — and frequently unanimous — Supreme Court has knocked down legal theories drummed up by well-meaning but overly zealous federal prosecutors.The inherent danger of prosecutorial overreach, the Barr memorandum emphasized, is all the more acute when applied in the sensitive context of presidential power. Firing James Comey, the F.B.I. director, may have been wise or unwise, but it should not in conscience be stretched to accuse a sitting president of criminal conduct. Nor should the mere expression of hope that Mr. Comey would go easy on Mr. Trump’s embattled national security adviser, Michael Flynn, somehow be transmogrified into a violation of federal law. To do so would flout first principles in our constitutional order of separated powers. Holding the president accountable for the exercise of his powers under Article II of the Constitution is a task entrusted to Congress, not to a largely unaccountable special counsel.Fairly reviewed, the Barr memorandum is a dispassionate analysis that provides an important perspective to the senior leadership of the Justice Department. Indeed, it bears emphasis that the memorandum also went to Steve Engel, the head of the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides the president legal advice. This is the same office that has issued formal opinions in both Republican and Democratic administrations saying that a president cannot be indicted while in office.Mr. Barr makes clear throughout the memorandum that he does not know all the underlying facts and appropriately qualifies his analysis with repeated “it appears” and “apparently.” Those caveats are highly relevant as the Senate deliberates his nomination. They demonstrate the vital quality of a careful lawyer’s open-mindedness, which has been vividly on display in recent days, when Mr. Barr has pledged to protect the independence of the Mueller investigation. “It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr told the Judiciary Committee. “I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish.”Another view of William Barr:Opinion | The Editorial BoardWith Barr, Will Justice Be Done?Jan. 12, 2019Once Mr. Barr is confirmed, the Justice Department’s ethics officers will carefully review whether he should be allowed to oversee the Mueller inquiry. In light of what we know, I see no reason he should step aside. Expressing his legal perspective on a legal theory of obstruction of justice should not come close to justifying the extraordinary action of requiring him to recuse himself from what will be one of the new attorney general’s most pressing responsibilities.The constitutionally ordained process of advise and consent should now be allowed to unfold. I am confident that Bill Barr will respond to all questions and concerns in a fair and honest way. I am also confident that he will be deeply respectful — as a matter of honor and integrity — of whatever advice he receives from the Justice Department’s ethics officers.

Rosenstein has been a central figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.CreditCreditTom Brenner/The New York TimesBy Katie BennerJan. 9, 2019WASHINGTON — Rod J. Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican with a tough-on-crime record, was eager to put his stamp on the Justice Department when he was sworn in as the deputy attorney general in the early months of the Trump administration.Instead, he was abruptly thrust into a political maelstrom after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director only two weeks later. Mr. Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate Russia’s election interference and spent the next year and a half defending that inquiry from both Mr. Trump’s unwavering attacks and attempted political intrusion by his congressional allies.Now Mr. Rosenstein plans to step down as the United States’ No. 2 law enforcement official after Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, is confirmed, three administration officials said on Wednesday. Senators could vote to confirm him as early as next month.Mr. Barr will represent a new chapter for the Justice Department and for the Russia investigation, which is nearing its final stages and is expected to be finished in the coming weeks or months, according to senior law enforcement officials. They cautioned that like any investigation, it could be prolonged if the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III, were to cover uncover new evidence central to his mandate.Mr. Barr, who met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of his confirmation hearing next week, holds a dim view of aspects of the investigation but affirmed that he would allow it to conclude, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee.“He says Bob Mueller is a great guy — ethical, professional,” Mr. Graham said of Mr. Barr in a brief interview. “He believes that he is not on a witch hunt, trusts him to be fair to the president and the country, and has no reason to believe he is not going to do that.”The timing of Mr. Rosenstein’s anticipated departure was unconnected to the Mueller investigation, a Trump administration official said. Mr. Rosenstein privately told Mr. Barr weeks ago that a term of roughly two years seemed like the right length, according to Mr. Graham.After Jeff Sessions’s time as attorney general was done, Mr. Rosenstein was supportive of the decision to replace him with Mr. Barr, according to a person who has discussed the issue with Mr. Rosenstein. He and Mr. Barr worked together at the Justice Department during the George Bush administration.While most deputy attorneys general labor in obscurity, Mr. Rosenstein became a target of criticism from the president and his allies while liberals cheered his efforts to shield the Russia investigation from Mr. Trump’s vitriol. He was given standing ovations at many of his speeches last year and was feted on late-night television. Strangers would ask him for his autograph and for photographs with him at airports and in other public places.But his record on the Russia investigation was more complicated. In the tumultuous days after the president fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, Mr. Rosenstein was shaken and angry, concerned that the White House had used him to justify the firing, associates have said.In meetings with senior law enforcement officials, he suggested secretly taping his conversations with Mr. Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, according to people familiar with the discussions and a memo written by Andrew McCabe, then the deputy F.B.I. director.Mr. Rosenstein ultimately sought to stem the chaos by appointing Mr. Mueller as special counsel, but he consulted almost no one, according to three department officials who were not authorized to discuss the appointment.Later, his work to protect the Mueller investigation from Mr. Trump’s congressional allies, whom Democrats accused of trying to subvert sensitive investigations, also drew criticism. To mollify the lawmakers, Mr. Rosenstein made scores of documents related to those inquiries available, moves that ran counter to law enforcement’s reticence to share information about investigations.Senior law enforcement officials noted that under Mr. Rosenstein, the department won one of its most critical battles with conservative lawmakers who had sought the declassification of a wiretap application at the heart of the Russia inquiry. Despite congressional Republicans’ urging, the White House declined to release the document.“Rod was in a truly unusual position and was largely a steady hand,” said Megan L. Brown, a lawyer at the firm Wiley Rein who worked at the Justice Department with Mr. Rosenstein under President George W. Bush.A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School, Mr. Rosenstein had worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years before becoming deputy attorney general. Early on, he was a trial lawyer in Washington and later was the United States attorney for Maryland under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.He ascended to his post eager to help Mr. Sessions crack down on violent crime and drug trafficking and became known for the long hours he kept while running the day-to-day work of the Justice Department, sometimes sending emails at 3 a.m., according to two lawyers who worked closely with him.Inside the department, law enforcement officials said Mr. Rosenstein helped usher in the sort of tough-on-crime policies that he supported during his 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Maryland. He also paid special attention to the nation’s federal prosecutors, some of whom said they felt neglected during past administrations.Mr. Rosenstein has been at the forefront of Trump administration efforts to crack down on Chinese spying while also tightening rules and cracking down on department employees who provide information to the news media to inform the public.He had an uneven relationship with Mr. Trump almost from the start. Though the president blamed Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, for the appointment of a special counsel, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Rosenstein repeatedly, calling him “conflicted” in one instance because Mr. Rosenstein had recommended Mr. Comey’s firing but installed Mr. Mueller.The relationship was tested in September after The New York Times revealed Mr. Rosenstein’s questioning in May 2017 of Mr. Trump’s fitness to be president and offers to secretly record conversations with him. Mr. Rosenstein has denied that account.Rattled and unsure how the president would react, Mr. Rosenstein considered quitting and even had aides draft a news release about his resignation. But senior White House advisers urged him to stay on, and, over time, he and the president, who meet or speak by telephone frequently, found common ground.It almost certainly helps that he is no longer the top law enforcement official overseeing the Mueller investigation. After the holidays last month, Mr. Rosenstein and his family visited Mr. Trump at the White House to meet the president and have a photograph taken with him.His uneasy standing with Mr. Trump is not lost on him. At a conference last month where the president was to appear later, Mr. Rosenstein joked: “You let the president know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.”Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos, Adam Goldman, Michael S. Schmidt and Eileen Sullivan.

Clicks and subscriptions are up, welcome news for an industry in shaky financial shape.But the ultimate prize has proved elusive for the scoop-hungry journalists competing to join the reporters’ pantheon alongside Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose methodical news-gathering for The Washington Post helped bring down a president alleged to have broken the law.The perils of the chase were plain to see on Friday night, when the office of the special counsel issued a public denial of what had been widely portrayed as a “bombshell report” from BuzzFeed News.The site, based in New York, has been as aggressive as any other news outlet in trying to break the Big One. Its latest attempt, published Thursday night, reported that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had evidence that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress.In their race to get ahead of Mr. Mueller with news that will please much of the electorate while also driving clicks and ratings, however, journalists throughout the media have produced their share of misfires and unforced errors. Each mistake has been a gift to the president, providing fodder for his case that any unflattering reporting about him amounts to “fake news,” and that the special counsel’s investigation is nothing but a “witch hunt.”The insatiable appetite of social media and cable news for fresh material makes the hunt for big stories even more perilous.“I say to you on the record, I am thankful I don’t have to cover this story on a daily basis,” said Mr. Woodward, whose latest book, “Fear,” a fly-on-the-wall view of the Trump administration’s first year, has sold some two million copies.“The hydraulic pressure in the system is just so great,” he added. “The impatience of the internet — ‘give it to us immediately’ — drives so much, it’s hard to sort something like this out.”BuzzFeed’s business model is built on that immediacy. Its newsroom is part of an organization whose mission is to find or create viral content. So you have serious journalism sitting almost side by side with lighthearted listicles like “28 Ryan Reynolds Tweets About Parenting That Will Make You Laugh Out Loud.”BuzzFeed News has produced top-flight work. But in fashioning itself as a 21st-century upstart challenging the traditionalists, it has also pushed the limits.It was the first to publish the collection of reports that were put together by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential campaign. Known as the dossier, the 35-page file was filled with what were at least then-unsubstantiated (and salacious) reports about Mr. Trump said to have been collected by Russian agents for blackmail purposes. Other news organizations, including this one, had all or part of the dossier, but decided against publishing any of its contents they couldn’t independently verify.The BuzzFeed News editor in chief, Ben Smith, argued that the dossier was worthy of release without full journalistic corroboration, partly because its contents had been shared with President Trump and others “at the highest levels of the U.S. government.” Providing that level of transparency, he argued, was “how we see the job of reporters in 2017.”BuzzFeed’s report last week was more traditional, providing information from “two federal law enforcement officials,” as the article described its sources. According to the piece, Mr. Mueller was in possession of documents, text messages and testimony from Mr. Cohen showing that Mr. Trump had directed him to lie to Congress about Trump business dealings in Moscow in 2016.BuzzFeed said the report was months in the making. But, given the weightiness of the accusations, the final push for input from Mr. Mueller’s office appears to have taken place on internet time.ImageBuzzFeed News reported that the president had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress, igniting a social media and cable news firestorm.CreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesJason Leopold, one of the article’s co-writers, sent a heads-up email to Mr. Mueller’s spokesman, Peter Carr, only several hours before publication. In the exchange, which was first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Leopold said that he was planning to report “Michael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations related to the Trump Moscow project.”The email did not mention that the article would also assert that Mr. Mueller had substantial evidence of the supposed presidential marching orders — a vital component that gave the story so much apparent heft.To be fair, Fortress Mueller has been a frustration for reporters. The special counsel’s office has kept leaks to a minimum while refusing, for the most part, to confirm or deny whatever report about its work is firing up the news algorithm. While its impenetrability may explain the BuzzFeed reporters’ casual-seeming approach, it’s not much of an excuse for skipping the steps taught in Journalism 101.The Mueller team’s challenge to the BuzzFeed report is also exposing the flaws of the wider media ecosystem, which is all too ready to spring into action at any sign of the Big One. Within minutes of the article’s publication on Thursday, Twitter was ablaze, and cable panelists were effusive. “This is stunning,” Don Lemon said on CNN. Lawrence O’Donnell spoke of “a Nixonian moment” on MSNBC.Fox News reported the article’s claims as potentially an “enormous, enormous problem for this presidency.” But the guest who described it that way, the Fox News contributor Guy Benson, also warned, “Proceed with caution on this story — it may be true, it may not.”By the following morning, other news organizations had failed to match the BuzzFeed piece with their own reporting and increasingly included “if true” caveats — but that didn’t prevent hours of on-air speculation about the potential implications of “subornation of perjury,” with its echoes of Watergate.Even after the special counsel’s statement on Friday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC speculated that it wasn’t a true denial. During an interview with Mr. Smith, she asked, “Do you have any concern that this statement from the special counsel’s office might be an effort to dissuade you and dissuade your reporters from pursuing this, even if it is accurate, either because it interferes with the special counsel’s investigation in some way or it is otherwise too uncomfortable for this Justice Department?”The further the disputed report traveled, the more it seemed to help Mr. Trump, who is forever on the lookout for material for the most intensive anti-press branding campaign ever to come from the Oval Office.As the former Associated Press top editor Kathleen Carroll described the current reporting environment to me: “It’s a very, very, very high wire, with a load of rusty razor blades underneath it.”Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein know better than most what BuzzFeed’s reporters and editors are now going through. During their history-making run, the duo misreported that a grand jury had received specific testimony about a secret slush fund controlled by Nixon’s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. The grand jury portion of the story was wrong, and the White House pounced on the error. But the substance was correct, and history ultimately vindicated them.Mr. Smith, the BuzzFeed News editor, told me that the special counsel’s office was “gnomic” in its denial. “We are confident that our reporting will stand up,” he said.For now, the story has fallen into a nether region occupied by two other recent, potentially groundbreaking stories on the Mueller investigation that have yet to be confirmed by others.The first is a report
from the McClatchy newspaper chain that cellphone signals placed Mr. Cohen near Prague in 2016, around the same time the Steele dossier placed him there for a meeting with Russian officials.And there was the report in The Guardian that President Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had paid a visit to Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, before that organization released a trove of emails that the United States has accused Russian agents of stealing from the Democrats.With the BuzzFeed story joining those two reports in journalistic limbo land, there are two options for the hair-trigger, Russia-investigation commentariat, said Richard Tofel, the president of ProPublica, the investigative news organization.“One is, try to figure out right this minute what the truth is, when you have no way of knowing,” Mr. Tofel said. “Or two, and both social media and cable news are a little bit at war with this: Wait a minute.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Bombshell’ Relegated To Limbo.

Over Inquiry Into Possible Aid to RussiaAdvertisementSupported byTrump Tweets Lengthy Attack on F.B.I. Over Inquiry Into Possible Aid to RussiaImagePresident Trump said on Twitter on Saturday that now-departed F.B.I. officials had “tried to do a number on your President” by investigating whether he had acted on behalf of Russia.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. SchmidtJan. 12, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the F.B.I. and the special counsel’s investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced “losers” at the bureau’s highest levels.In a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry. He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.In his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the F.B.I. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats — another misleading assertion — bent on taking him down.Individually, the president’s claims were familiar. But as the special counsel’s inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to discredit the investigation.Hours later, Mr. Trump continued his broadside on a friendly television venue, Jeanine Pirro’s show on Fox News. Asked “are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?” Mr. Trump did not directly answer the question.“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he said by telephone. “I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written.”He also denied a report in The Washington Post that he had taken extensive steps to conceal from other high-ranking officials his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over the past two years.Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that his panel would hold hearings on “the mysteries swirling around Trump’s bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security.”ImageJames B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, responded to Mr. Trump with a quotation attributed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.”CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesIn his Twitter outburst earlier in the day, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of opening “for no reason” and “with no proof” an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually “FAR tougher” than those of his predecessors.The Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump’s behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.Naming several of the bureau’s now-departed top officials, including Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. had “tried to do a number on your President,” accusing the “losers” of essentially fabricating a case. “Part of the Witch Hunt,” he wrote — referring dismissively to the investigation now being overseen by Mr. Mueller.At the time he was fired in May 2017, Mr. Comey had been leading the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the officials believed that his removal, in hindering the inquiry, posed a possible threat to national security. Their decision to open the case was informed, in part, by two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the firing to the Russia investigation.The inquiry they opened had two aspects, including both the newly disclosed counterintelligence element and a criminal element that has long been publicly known: whether the firing constituted obstruction of justice.When Mr. Mueller was appointed days later, he took over the joint inquiry as part of his larger investigation of Russia’s action in 2016 and whether anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. It is not clear whether he is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and no public evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump himself secretly conspired with the Russian government or took directions from it.Mr. Trump indicated on Saturday that he had not known of the existence of the counterintelligence investigation before the Times article, and he did not dispute the newspaper’s reporting.But he made clear that he viewed any such inquiry as illegitimate from the start. He presented it, without evidence, as part of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to undo his presidency.In the tweets, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Comey — “a total sleaze!” — at length, accusing the former director of overseeing a “rigged & botched” investigation of Mrs. Clinton, and leading the agency into “complete turmoil.” Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Mr. Comey removed, he said.“My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He was a Crooked Cop.”But an investigation conducted by the Justice Department’s inspector general and internal surveys of F.B.I. agents have undercut Mr. Trump’s portrayal of Mr. Comey as corrupt and unpopular within the bureau.ImageAndrew G. McCabe has argued that his firing by Mr. Trump as deputy F.B.I. director was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation.CreditPete Marovich/Getty ImagesMr. Trump’s comments echoed those that his White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, released on Friday night.“This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the F.B.I.,” Ms. Sanders said. “Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.”Parts of the statements by Mr. Trump and Ms. Sanders are at odds with the public record and with the findings of the inspector general’s report. While Democrats were furious with Mr. Comey over his public statements about the Clinton email server case — at a news conference and in a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign — they were deeply alarmed by his removal, given his role in the Russia investigation.In his report, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, pointedly criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy to publicly discuss the Clinton case, and he castigated “insubordinate” senior officials who worked with Mr. Comey for privately criticizing Mr. Trump even as they investigated him. But he ultimately said he had found no evidence to believe that the decisions not to charge Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server in handling classified information “were affected by bias or other improper considerations.”“Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor’s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice,” he wrote.Mr. McCabe, who briefly served as acting director after Mr. Comey was removed, was fired last March for failing to be forthcoming with investigators about an unrelated conversation he had authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. Mr. McCabe argued that the firing was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation. Other members of Mr. Comey’s team have also been fired or left the bureau.Mr. Comey responded on Twitter on Saturday with a quotation attributed to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.”The Times report cited former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation, as well as private testimony that the F.B.I.’s former general counsel, James A. Baker, delivered to Congress related to the inquiry.“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.Some former law enforcement officials outside the case have since debated whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a chaotic period after Mr. Comey’s firing. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.

Giuliani backtracked on Thursday from a surprising assertion he had made a night earlier that left open the possibility that Trump campaign aides might have coordinated with Russia in its election interference in 2016.“There was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form,” Mr. Giuliani said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating the president’s longstanding defense against accusations that his campaign secretly coordinated with Moscow to help swing the election. “Likewise, I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign.”He added, referring to discredited conspiracy theories that the president and his allies have long cited, “The only knowledge I have in this regard is the collusion of the Clinton campaign with Russia, which has so far been ignored.”Mr. Giuliani was seeking to clarify an interview on Wednesday night in which he stopped short of defending Trump campaign aides, drawing speculation that he might have inside knowledge of possible coordination with Russia.“I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign,” he told CNN. He added: “I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack” the Democratic National Committee.[ Trump allies have repeatedly shifted their defense as evidence of contacts with Russians grew.]Mr. Giuliani’s backpedaling was the latest in a series of conflicting comments he has made about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The evolution of his statements have suggested shifts in the president’s defense strategy, often following developments in the investigations. On Tuesday, prosecutors for the special counsel filed a 200-page, mostly redacted court document related to the case against Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Among the little information that was not blacked out were details about his relationship with a Russian whom prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence.The special counsel’s document was in response to a recent filing by Mr. Manafort’s legal team, which inadvertently disclosed that Mr. Manafort had provided his Russian associate with American polling data — details that offer the clearest example yet that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russia before the 2016 election.Mr. Giuliani has previously denied that there was coordination by Trump campaign aides.“When I say the Trump campaign, I mean the upper levels of the Trump campaign,” Mr. Giuliani said during a July interview with Fox News. “I have no reason to believe anybody else did. The only ones I checked with obviously are the top four or five people.”Mr. Giuliani also went a bit further on the collusion defense, telling Fox, “Even if he did it, it’s not a crime.”Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.The president agreed with him in a subsequent Twitter post, and added that Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic rival, was the one who was doing the colluding.Mr. Trump has long maintained that his campaign never aided Russia’s meddling, even as the special counsel inquiry has revealed communications between Russians and some Trump campaign aides.While the word “collusion” has no defined legal meaning, in plain English, it means working together, typically in secret, to do something illicit. And whether Mr. Trump knew during the campaign of any Russian attempts to disrupt the election has been a central question in the investigation that started in the summer of 2016.Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, was prepared to tell prosecutors that Mr. Trump knew about a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower that was arranged so campaign officials could get damaging information on Mrs. Clinton from Russians.The president and his lawyers have denied that Mr. Trump had any knowledge of the meeting until July 2017, when The New York Times was preparing to publish an article about it.At the time, when the White House was scrambling to prepare a statement about the Trump Tower meeting in response to The Times’s article, Mr. Trump met with President Vladimir V. Putin for more than two hours in Hamburg, Germany, where they were attending an economic summit meeting. Later that day, Mr. Trump sought out the Russian leader during a summit meeting dinner. Only interpreters, the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, were in the first meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Afterward, Mr. Trump took his interpreter’s notes and told the interpreter not to tell anyone what was discussed. No American officials were present for the second encounter during the dinner.The following day, while Mr. Trump traveled back to Washington on Air Force One, he called a Times reporter to say that the Russians had been falsely accused by American intelligence agencies of hacking during the campaign. The president also huddled with his aides to draft a statement in response to the article about the Trump Tower meeting and personally dictated a misleading account that the meeting was about Russian adoptions. He did not admit that the meeting was arranged to address Russia’s offer to help his campaign, which emails later obtained by The Times confirmed.Earlier this week, senators questioned Mr. Trump’s nominee to be the next attorney general, William P. Barr, about how the Justice Department would handle a hypothetical report from Mr. Mueller. That there will be such a report at the end of the special counsel’s investigation is just speculation, but Mr. Barr was pressed on whether he would share the report with Congress and the public and whether what he shared would be an altered version of the original.The questioning drew on comments Mr. Giuliani had previously made about how the president might invoke executive privilege to prevent the report from going to Congress, or that the White House might edit the report before sending it to lawmakers “so we can correct it if they’re wrong.”Mr. Barr assured senators on Tuesday that the White House would not be correcting the report before releasing it. And Mr. Giuliani said his comments Wednesday on CNN had not been an effort to address a possible Mueller report detailing evidence of cooperation between Trump campaign aides and Russia.“I have no knowledge of collusion involving the campaign, nor does the president,” Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Thursday. “However, I only represent the president, and that’s all I can speak for.”Eileen Sullivan reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

The firm has been roiled by the scrutiny from its dealings with Paul Manafort, a former Trump associate.CreditCreditPeter Nicholls/ReutersBy Kenneth P. Vogel and Matthew GoldsteinJan. 17, 2019WASHINGTON — A global New York-based law firm has agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle a Justice Department investigation into whether its work for a Russia-aligned Ukrainian government violated lobbying laws.The investigation stems from work that the firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, did with Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman. The case overlaps with the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election.As part of the settlement, the law firm agreed to register retroactively as a foreign agent for Ukraine in addition to paying the government $4.6 million, representing the money it earned from its work in Ukraine.The settlement between the firm and the Justice Department, which was made public on Thursday, is the latest indication that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry and related investigations are fundamentally challenging the lucrative but shadowy foreign-lobbying industry that has thrived in Washington.For decades, lobbyists and lawyers have collected millions of dollars to burnish the images of sometimes unsavory foreign interests in Congress and the news media, often skirting requirements that they disclose the work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.The Justice Department, which is charged with enforcing the 80-year-old act, had largely turned a blind eye until Mr. Mueller began charging Mr. Trump’s associates, including Mr. Manafort, who had built a lucrative business advising Russia-aligned politicians and wealthy business executives in Ukraine.In this case, Mr. Manafort had arranged for a team of lawyers from Skadden Arps to conduct an analysis in 2012 that he intended to use to allay international concerns about the anti-democratic practices of the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine.Mr. Yanukovych, a major client of Mr. Manafort and an ally of the Kremlin, had been accused of political motives in the prosecuting and jailing of one of his leading political rivals, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on charges of abusing her position as prime minister in negotiating a natural gas deal with Russia.Skadden Arps was hired to conduct a purportedly independent analysis of her prosecution and trial, and to advise the Yanukovych government on a potential future prosecution. The firm was paid more than $4.6 million, partly through the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and partly through offshore accounts controlled by Mr. Manafort.A Skadden Arps team led by Gregory B. Craig, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama, produced a report concluding that, while the trial violated some of Ms. Tymoshenko’s rights, her conviction was supported by the evidence presented at trial. And the report found no evidence that the prosecution was politically motivated.Mr. Craig, who maintained deep connections to Washington’s Democratic establishment and its press corps, worked to shape the public relations strategy for the release of the report, according to a Justice Department filing released with the settlement.The filing, which identifies Mr. Craig as “Partner 1” but does not name him, indicates that he arranged for a journalist to receive a copy of the report, then discussed the report with that journalist. The journalist, who is not named in the filing, is David E. Sanger of The New York Times, which published an article in December 2012 about the report quoting Mr. Craig.Mr. Craig and Skadden Arps should have disclosed that activity under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA, which covers both lobbying and public relations on behalf of foreign political interests, the Justice Department said. But Mr. Craig misled both his colleagues at Skadden Arps and officials in the Justice Department’s FARA unit about his interactions with the news media, leading the Justice Department to conclude that the firm was not obligated to register under the act, the settlement filing said.The settlement “puts law firms on notice that they can’t hide behind their identity as lawyers. If they are doing lobbying work on behalf of foreign countries, they need to register under FARA,” said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics. “It also shows that the government will not tolerate false statements by lawyers.”Skadden Arps said in a statement that it had “learned much from this incident” and was “taking steps to prevent anything similar from happening again.”Mr. Craig’s lawyer declined to comment.The investigation that led to the settlement with Skadden Arps was handled by the Justice Department’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, which includes the FARA unit. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, to which Mr. Mueller’s team referred illegal lobbying cases, asked witnesses about Mr. Craig’s involvement in Mr. Manafort’s work as recently as last month, according to people familiar with the case.Among the lobbying being investigated by the New York prosecutors is the involvement of two other firms that worked on the rollout of the Tymoshenko report. One is Mercury Public Affairs, whose lead partner on the account was Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress. The other is the Podesta Group, led by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser whose business collapsed in 2017 under the glare of Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny and attacks from the right.The firms initially did not register their work under FARA either, though they registered retroactively as investigators began examining their work.Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, pointed out that his firm based its initial decision to forgo FARA filing on advice from Skadden Arps, and he said “we were surprised to learn about their separate communications with the FARA unit and the facts surrounding those discussions.”In the settlement agreement, the Justice Department specifies that it has not made any “promise or representation” about “any civil or criminal liability” related to the unregistered lobbying by Skadden Arps’s “current or former partners, agents, employees, attorneys” or people who worked with them.Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as the investigation of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated.The 70-year-old firm has been roiled by the scrutiny from its dealings with Mr. Manafort, whose daughter went to work as an associate at Skadden Arps around the time the Tymoshenko report was released.In 2017, as the Justice Department continued investigating the Ukraine work, Skadden Arps refunded $567,000 to the Ukrainian government, suggesting in a statement that it returned the cash because the money had been placed “in escrow for future work” that never took place.A lawyer who worked on the report for Skadden, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty last year to lying to the special counsel about his communications with one of Mr. Manafort’s associates.And renewed scrutiny on the report, which an Obama State Department official panned as “incomplete” the day after its release and was subsequently called a “whitewash” by experts, has led to criticism of the firm’s willingness to rent its reputation to unsavory clients.In an interview last month, Ms. Tymoshenko, who is a leading candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, accused Skadden Arps of carrying water for the Yanukovych government.“It’s a pity that such a well-known company like Skadden even considered to take this case to deliver,” she said. “This is a dirty, dirty, dirty contract.”Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Matthew Goldstein from New York.

Opened Inquiry Into Whether Trump Was Secretly Working on Behalf of RussiaAdvertisementSupported byF.B.I. Opened Inquiry Into Whether Trump Was Secretly Working on Behalf of RussiaImageFollowing President Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau grew increasingly concerned about whether the president’s actions constituted anti-American activity.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Adam Goldman, Michael S. Schmidt and Nicholas FandosJan. 11, 2019WASHINGTON — In the days after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.The inquiry carried explosive implications. Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security. Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow’s influence.The investigation the F.B.I. opened into Mr. Trump also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether his firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.Agents and senior F.B.I. officials had grown suspicious of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off on opening an investigation into him, the people said, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. But the president’s activities before and after Mr. Comey’s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said.[Trump responds to the Times's report on the FBI investigation via Twitter.]The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. That inquiry is part of Mr. Mueller’s broader examination of how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired with them. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and some former law enforcement officials outside the investigation have questioned whether agents overstepped in opening it.The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A. Baker, who served as F.B.I. general counsel until late 2017. He privately testified in October before House investigators who were examining the F.B.I.’s handling of the full Russia inquiry.ImageThe F.B.I. investigated whether the firing of Mr. Comey was a national security threat.CreditErik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times. Mr. Baker did not explicitly acknowledge the existence of the investigation of Mr. Trump to congressional investigators.No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. An F.B.I. spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office both declined to comment.Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, sought to play down the significance of the investigation. “The fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing,” Mr. Giuliani said on Friday, though he acknowledged that he had no insight into the inquiry.The cloud of the Russia investigation has hung over Mr. Trump since even before he took office, though he has long vigorously denied any illicit connection to Moscow. The obstruction inquiry,
revealed by The Washington Post a few weeks after Mr. Mueller was appointed, represented a direct threat that he was unable to simply brush off as an overzealous examination of a handful of advisers. But few details have been made public about the counterintelligence aspect of the investigation.The decision to investigate Mr. Trump himself was an aggressive move by F.B.I. officials who were confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Mr. Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.”A vigorous debate has taken shape among some former law enforcement officials outside the case over whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a tumultuous period at the Justice Department. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.The F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.Mr. Trump had caught the attention of F.B.I. counterintelligence agents when he called on Russia during a campaign news conference in July 2016 to hack into the emails of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump had refused to criticize Russia on the campaign trail, praising President Vladimir V. Putin. And investigators had watched with alarm as the Republican Party softened its convention platform on the Ukraine crisis in a way that seemed to benefit Russia.How the Mueller Investigation Could Play Out for TrumpIf Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.Other factors fueled the F.B.I.’s concerns, according to the people familiar with the inquiry. Christopher Steele, a former British spy who worked as an F.B.I. informant, had compiled memos in mid-2016 containing unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail and bribe him.In the months before the 2016 election, the F.B.I. was also already investigating four of Mr. Trump’s associates over their ties to Russia. The constellation of events disquieted F.B.I. officials who were simultaneously watching as Russia’s campaign unfolded to undermine the presidential election by exploiting existing divisions among Americans.“In the Russian Federation and in President Putin himself, you have an individual whose aim is to disrupt the Western alliance and whose aim is to make Western democracy more fractious in order to weaken our ability, America’s ability and the West’s ability to spread our democratic ideals,” Lisa Page, a former bureau lawyer, told House investigators in private testimony reviewed by The Times.“That’s the goal, to make us less of a moral authority to spread democratic values,” she added. Parts of her testimony were first reported by The Epoch Times.And when a newly inaugurated Mr. Trump sought a loyalty pledge from Mr. Comey and later asked that he end an investigation into the president’s national security adviser, the requests set off discussions among F.B.I. officials about opening an inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had tried to obstruct that case.But law enforcement officials put off the decision to open the investigation until they had learned more, according to people familiar with their thinking. As for a counterintelligence inquiry, they concluded that they would need strong evidence to take the sensitive step of investigating the president, and they were also concerned that the existence of such an inquiry could be leaked to the news media, undermining the entire investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election.After Mr. Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, two more of Mr. Trump’s actions prompted them to quickly abandon those reservations.The first was a letter Mr. Trump wanted to send to Mr. Comey about his firing, but never did, in which he mentioned the Russia investigation. In the letter, Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Comey for previously telling him he was not a subject of the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Even after the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, wrote a more restrained draft of the letter and told Mr. Trump that he did not have to mention the Russia investigation — Mr. Comey’s poor handling of the Clinton email investigation would suffice as a fireable offense, he explained — Mr. Trump directed Mr. Rosenstein to mention the Russia investigation anyway.He disregarded the president’s order, irritating Mr. Trump. The president ultimately added a reference to the Russia investigation to the note he had delivered, thanking Mr. Comey for telling him three times that he was not under investigation.The second event that troubled investigators was an NBC News interview two days after Mr. Comey’s firing in which Mr. Trump appeared to say he had dismissed Mr. Comey because of the Russia inquiry.“I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it,” he said. “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”Mr. Trump’s aides have said that a fuller examination of his comments demonstrates that he did not fire Mr. Comey to end the Russia inquiry. “I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people,” Mr. Trump added. “He’s the wrong man for that position.”As F.B.I. officials debated whether to open the investigation, some of them pushed to move quickly before Mr. Trump appointed a director who might slow down or even end their investigation into Russia’s interference. Many involved in the case viewed Russia as the chief threat to American democratic values.“With respect to Western ideals and who it is and what it is we stand for as Americans, Russia poses the most dangerous threat to that way of life,” Ms. Page told investigators for a joint House Judiciary and Oversight Committee investigation into Moscow’s election interference.F.B.I. officials viewed their decision to move quickly as validated when a comment the president made to visiting Russian officials in the Oval Office shortly after he fired Mr. Comey was revealed days later.“I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Mr. Trump said, according to a document summarizing the meeting. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” Follow Adam Goldman, Michael S.

Vogel and Maggie HabermanJan. 8, 2019WASHINGTON — As a top official in President Trump’s campaign, Paul Manafort shared political polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday. The document provided the clearest evidence to date that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russians during the 2016 presidential race.Mr. Manafort’s lawyers made the disclosure by accident, through a formatting error in a document filed to respond to charges that he had lied to prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with their investigation into Russian interference in the election.The document also revealed that during the campaign, Mr. Manafort and his Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine. Throughout the campaign and the early days of the Trump administration, Russia and its allies were pushing various plans for Ukraine in the hope of gaining relief from American-led sanctions imposed after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.Prosecutors and the news media have already documented a string of encounters between Russian operatives and Trump campaign associates dating from the early months of Mr. Trump’s bid for the presidency, including the now-famous meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan with a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The accidental disclosure appeared to some experts to be perhaps most damning of all.“This is the closest thing we have seen to collusion,” Clint Watts, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said of the data-sharing. “The question now is, did the president know about it?”The document gave no indication of whether Mr. Trump was aware of the data transfer or how Mr. Kilimnik might have used the information. But from March to August 2016, when Mr. Manafort worked for the Trump campaign, Russia was engaged in a full-fledged operation using social media, stolen emails and other tactics to boost Mr. Trump, attack Mrs. Clinton and play on divisive issues such as race and guns. Polling data could conceivably have helped Russia hone those messages and target audiences to help swing votes to Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, transferred the data to Mr. Kilimnik in the spring of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation. Most of the data was public, but some of it was developed by a private polling firm working for the campaign, according to the person.Mr. Manafort asked Mr. Gates to tell Mr. Kilimnik to pass the data to two Ukrainian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, the person said. The oligarchs had financed Russian-aligned Ukrainian political parties that had hired Mr. Manafort as a political consultant.A representative for Mr. Akhmetov said he did not request or receive any data from Mr. Kilimnik and has had no contact with either Mr. Kilimnik or Mr. Manafort since before the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Lyovochkin did not respond to a request for comment.Why Mr. Manafort wanted them to see American polling data is unclear. He might have hoped that any proof that he was managing a winning candidate would help him collect money he claimed to be owed for his work on behalf of the Ukrainian parties.About the same time, Mr. Manafort was also trying to curry favor with Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian billionaire close to the Kremlin and an associate of Mr. Kilimnik. In July 2016, Mr. Manafort, then the Trump campaign chairman, told Mr. Kilimnik that he could offer Mr. Deripaska “private briefings,” according to emails reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Deripaska had claimed Mr. Manafort owed him millions from a failed business venture, and Mr. Manafort may have been trying to use his status in the campaign to hold him at bay.The surprise disclosures about Mr. Manafort were the latest in two years of steady revelations about contacts between associates of Mr. Trump’s and Russian officials or operatives. In another development on Tuesday, the Russian lawyer who met with senior campaign officials at Trump Tower in June 2016 was charged with obstruction of justice in an unrelated case. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said that the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, had pretended to a federal judge that she was purely a private defense lawyer when in fact she was working with the Russian government to thwart the civil prosecution of a Russian company.Of the various Russian intermediaries to the Trump campaign, Mr. Kilimnik appears to be one of the most important to Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. A Russian citizen and resident, he faces charges from Mr. Mueller’s team of tampering with witnesses who had information about Mr. Manafort, but Mr. Kilimnik is not expected to ever stand trial. He did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment on Tuesday.His relationship with Mr. Manafort dates back years. The two men worked together to promote a Russia-aligned politician, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who rose to Ukraine’s presidency, was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to Russia in 2014. The two men continued working together over the next three years as Mr. Manafort’s financial troubles grew and investigators began to investigate a fraud scheme that eventually led to his conviction for 10 felonies.In August 2016, apparently just before Mr. Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign, he and Mr. Kilimnik met to discuss a plan for Ukraine that seemed to further Russia’s interests. They also met several times afterward, including once in Madrid in early 2017. In an interview in February 2017 in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, Mr. Kilimnik suggested the plan would have involved reviving the political fortunes of Mr. Yanukovych, the ousted Ukrainian leader.For Russia, trying to influence the incoming Trump administration’s policy on Ukraine was of paramount importance. The economic sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea damaged the Russian economy, and various emissaries have tried to convince administration officials to broker a resolution to a long-running guerrilla war between Russia and Ukraine.In one previously reported case, for instance, an obscure Ukrainian lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, worked with two associates of Mr. Trump’s, Felix Sater and Michael D. Cohen, to deliver one Ukraine “peace plan” to the White House. The plan landed on the desk of Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, just before he was forced to resign.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Artemenko said that investigators working for Mr. Mueller had questioned him extensively about his efforts to promote that plan. Mr. Artemenko said he knew neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Kilimnik and stressed that his plan was different from theirs.Prosecutors have accused Mr. Manafort of lying not only about his interactions with Mr. Kilimnik, but about other matters, including his contacts with senior administration officials in early 2017 and a payment related to a pro-Trump political action committee to cover his legal expenses. In November, after a dozen meetings with Mr. Manafort, they broke off the plea agreement with him, citing what they said was a series of lies.In their filing, Mr. Manafort’s defense lawyers said that Mr. Manafort never intentionally misled federal authorities. Instead, they cast him as a sick man — troubled by “severe” gout, as well as by depression and anxiety — who made misstatements because of a faulty memory and lack of access to his own records.They nevertheless said that they would not seek a hearing to challenge the prosecutors’ accusations that he lied, a decision that brings Mr. Manafort one step closer to being sentenced for his crimes.The decision not to seek a hearing reflected the dearth of legal choices for Mr. Manafort, 69, who has been in jail in Northern Virginia since mid-June. One prosecution resulted in his jury conviction in August for bank fraud, tax fraud and other financial crimes. A second led to his guilty plea in September on two conspiracy charges, including one stemming from a witness-tampering scheme with Mr. Kilimnik. Mr. Manafort faces at least 10 years in prison.The plea agreement gives the prosecutors the power to almost unilaterally decide whether Mr. Manafort has violated it. Unless Mr. Manafort can show they acted in bad faith — a high bar — their judgment stands. The prosecutors could also decide to file new charges against Mr. Manafort for lying to them, but apparently they do not plan to do so, according to Tuesday’s filing.“They have him so deeply in the soup here that what both sides are almost saying is that this doesn’t matter,” said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor.Correction: Jan. 9, 2019A previous version of this article misidentified the people to whom Paul Manafort wanted a Russian associate to send polling data.

It was not clear, however, what Mr. Trump saw as an alternative. “I’m not looking to call a national emergency,” he said on Monday. “This is so simple you shouldn’t have to.”ImageSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in December after meeting with President Trump.CreditPablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated PressMr. Trump, advisers said, has refused to allow his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, or anyone else negotiating on his behalf to compromise on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. That has led to awkward moments in front of congressional leaders.In a meeting at the White House with lawmakers from both parties on Jan. 4, Mr. Trump castigated Mr. Mulvaney for proposing a compromise figure between Mr. Trump’s desired $5.7 billion for a wall and the Democrats’ offer of $1.3 billion for border security, as a way to end the shutdown.Using an expletive, the president blamed his acting chief of staff for messing up the negotiations. The salty exchange was first reported by Axios.Mr. Trump emerged on the South Lawn on Monday after spending a snowy weekend without leaving the White House grounds. It was a rare occurrence for a president who typically spends weekend afternoons during winter on his golf course in Palm Beach.But Mr. Trump’s physical presence in the capital has become one of the ways he has tried to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate with Democrats on funding the wall, even as he has staked out an intractable position on the issue. It is a point of pride he has highlighted on Twitter and in interviews, as he has become concerned about the perception that he is being outmaneuvered by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a veteran negotiator who even Mr. Trump has praised in the past.Redefining Representation: The Women of the 116th CongressJust over 100 years ago, the first woman was sworn into Congress. As of this month, a record 131 women are serving in the Legislature. The New York Times photographed them.“I haven’t left the White House in months,” Mr. Trump told Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host who is also a personal friend of the president’s, in a phone-in interview on her show Saturday night. In fact, Mr. Trump traveled to the Texas border earlier in the week.On Monday, Mr. Trump again highlighted his physical presence in Washington as a selling point. “I’ve been here all weekend,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of the Democrats were in Puerto Rico celebrating something. I don’t know, maybe they’re celebrating the shutdown.”While about 30 Democratic lawmakers, most of whom are members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, spent the weekend at an annual winter retreat in Puerto Rico, Ms. Pelosi spent the entire weekend in Washington, a spokesman said.Mr. Trump, advisers said, still believes he has the upper hand with Democrats. But people in the White House have become increasingly concerned as the shutdown drags on and public opinion polls have shown that the majority of the country pins the blame on Mr. Trump.About 53 percent of Americans see Mr. Trump and the Republicans as mainly at fault for the shutdown, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted between Jan. 8 and 11. Only 29 percent blamed Democrats in Congress for the partial government shutdown that has left 800,000 federal employees working without pay, or furloughed.Adding to Mr. Trump’s rigidity in the shutdown negotiations is the anticipation among White House officials that a report from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could be delivered to the Justice Department in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump is agitated by the prospect of Mr. Mueller’s report, according to people who have spoken with him, even as advisers have tried to downplay what might be in it.Related CoverageTrump Confronts the Prospect of a ‘Nonstop Political War’ for SurvivalJan. 13, 2019ImageTrump Pulls Back From Declaring a National Emergency to Fund a WallJan. 11, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsSupreme Court Won’t Rule on Legality of Acting Attorney General’s Appointment - The New York Times

Whitaker in 2018. Legal scholars are divided on whether Mr. Whitaker’s appointment was lawful.CreditCreditSamuel Corum for The New York TimesBy Adam LiptakJan. 14, 2019WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court declined on Monday to decide whether President Trump acted lawfully in appointing Matthew G. Whitaker to be the acting attorney general, denying an unusual motion asking the justices to address that question in the context of a case about a different issue. The court also turned down the case itself.The court’s order was two sentences long and gave no reasons. There were no noted dissents.The case, Michaels v. Whitaker, No. 18-496, concerned Barry Michaels, who was convicted of securities fraud in 1998 and wanted to buy a gun. He challenged a federal law banning gun ownership by people convicted of felonies on Second Amendment grounds.The request for a ruling on Mr. Whitaker’s appointment came in the form of a motion to change the name of the case to Michaels v. Rosenstein, on the theory that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein is the rightful acting attorney general because Mr. Whitaker’s appointment violated federal statutes and the Constitution.Legal scholars are divided on whether Mr. Whitaker’s appointment was lawful.The answer to the question could figure in the fate of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation had been supervised by Mr. Rosenstein and has passed to Mr. Whitaker, who has been critical of it.But it became less pressing with Mr. Trump’s nomination of William P. Barr to be attorney general.It would have been unusual for the Supreme Court to rule on a substantial constitutional and statutory question in the context of a motion to change the caption of a case.Mr. Michaels’s lawyers included Thomas C. Goldstein, a prominent Supreme Court litigator. He wrote that prompt action by the court was warranted.“If this court declines to resolve this question immediately and instead determines several months in the future that Mr. Whitaker’s appointment was always invalid,” Mr. Goldstein wrote, “then ‘unwinding’ all of those personal orders would be a fraught and disruptive exercise that could embroil the federal courts in innumerable collateral disputes.”In response, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote that Mr. Whitaker’s appointment was lawful and that a motion to change the name of the case was a “procedural gambit” that the justices should reject.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.White nationalism lost in federal court yesterday.Judge Jesse Furman blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to add a question to the 2020 census asking about citizenship status. Furman “found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated federal law by misleading the public — and his own department — about the reasons for adding the question,” Dara Lind of Vox writes.Ross claimed, laughably, that the citizenship question would help the Trump administration enforce voting rights. In truth, it was designed to intimidate Latinos — both legal and illegal — into not responding to the census. The resulting undercount would then reduce the political representation of immigrant-heavy regions and cause them to receive less federal funding.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The citizenship question, Paul Waldman writes in The Washington Post, is part of “a broader effort on the part of Republicans to put a thumb on the electoral scale in every way they possibly can, whether it’s extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression efforts targeted at minorities, or the use of the census to make Republican victories just that much more likely.”Yesterday’s ruling isn’t the final word. The Trump administration will likely appeal, and the appeal will likely reach the Supreme Court, where Republican-appointed justices hold a five-to-four majority.But there is some reason to hope the justices will avoid an obviously partisan decision. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two newest conservative justices, have previously taken a dim view of federal officials who exceed limits on their power, The Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson explains. “While it’s always possible that the Court’s conservatives will vote ideology over principle … their particular judicial philosophies do not bode well for the Trump administration’s brazen defiance of administrative law,” Michaelson writes.A side note: Given the combination of his census exploits, his lies about those exploits and his shady stock trades, Ross may now deserve consideration if my colleague Gail Collins revisits her analysis of the worst Trump Cabinet member. His case is helped by the fact that some of his even more corrupt colleagues have recently departed the administration.Barr’s barWilliam Barr’s answers about the Russia investigation weren’t great. Barr — the nominee for U.S. attorney general — told senators yesterday that he would not necessarily recuse himself from a case even if ethics officials found him to have a conflict of interest. And Barr refused to commit to a public release of Robert Mueller’s findings.Yet I was still more encouraged than alarmed by yesterday’s confirmation hearing. At this point, I have extremely low expectations for Cabinet officials selected by President Trump. Barr beat these expectations by saying he would allow Mueller to finish his investigation of Trump. He also came off as substantially more competent and professional than much of the Trump team.And once Mueller does finish his investigation, I think it’s unlikely that his findings will remain secret, regardless of what Barr tries to do. Mueller is a savvy political operator who understands how to use court filings and other means to inform the public of his work. Now that Democrats hold the House, they will also be able to help prevent the findings from remaining secret.“The idea an unclassified Mueller report won’t end up at least de facto public strikes me as totally ridiculous,” tweeted the Georgetown political scientist Matt Glassman yesterday. “To sit on this thing would be almost instantly unsustainable politically.”The crucial thing at this point is that Mueller be able to continue his work unimpeded. Given Barr’s past criticism of the investigation — which Andrew Cohen of the Brennan Center for Justice explains in Slate — he doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt. But his remarks yesterday were somewhat better than I had feared.The Brexit messA quick word on the big parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan: Both the cancel-Brexit crowd and the Brexit-without-conditions crowd are feeling hopeful that they can prevail. This confidence has meant neither side has been willing to support May’s more moderate — but still radical — version of Brexit.Britain’s political leaders are now sharply divided among these three broad camps, and none of them has a majority in Parliament. The next steps are uncertain. Any of the three sides could still prevail. If the Brexit-without-conditions side does, Britain could be in for a lot of pain.(And, yes, today’s newsletter is unusually long, because yesterday was unusually newsy.)If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Deripaska last June in Moscow.CreditCreditSergei Karpukhin/ReutersBy Kenneth P. VogelJan. 15, 2019WASHINGTON — A group of 11 Republican senators broke ranks with their leadership and the administration on Tuesday to side with Democrats in a showdown over sanctions on Russia, underscoring the political sensitivity of the issue amid questions about President Trump’s relationship with Moscow.The Republicans voted with Democrats seeking to keep sanctions in place on companies controlled by an influential Russian oligarch with connections to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The 11 Republican votes allowed Senate Democrats to advance a measure that would reverse a decision last month by the Treasury Department to lift sanctions that it imposed last year on companies controlled by the oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, including the aluminum giant Rusal.The Treasury Department’s decision would leave in place personal sanctions on Mr. Deripaska and require him to give up control over Rusal and two linked companies, EN+ and JSC EuroSibEnergo.The measure still needs to clear several more hurdles, and proponents need to attract at least two more Republican votes to win final passage in the Senate. But Tuesday’s vote was a symbolic crack in the Republican Party, and came despite opposition from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and a last-ditch plea by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The vote in some ways forced Republicans to choose between the party’s traditional foreign policy, which has long supported a tougher line on Russia, and Mr. Trump, whose warmer stance toward Russia has inflamed questions about Moscow’s efforts in 2016 to help elect him.The sanctions were announced by the Treasury Department last April on Mr. Deripaska, his companies and those of other Russian oligarchs in retaliation for the Russian meddling in the presidential election. The announcement was touted as evidence that the administration was taking a tough stance against Moscow despite Mr. Trump’s equivocation on Russian interference and his warm words for Mr. Putin.But the Treasury Department repeatedly delayed the full implementation of the sanctions against the three Deripaska companies amid an aggressive lobbying and legal campaign in Washington by the companies and their allies. They argued that the sanctions could have unintended negative effects on companies in the United States, Europe, Jamaica, Guinea and elsewhere by disrupting the supply of aluminum.The Treasury Department echoed those concerns in announcing last month that it would lift the sanctions against the three Deripaska companies as part of an agreement that it said would reduce Mr. Deripaska’s ownership and control of the companies.The move prompted howls of protest from Democrats and some Russia hawks, who accused the administration of going soft on Russia in the midst of the special counsel’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia’s election meddling. Mr. Deripaska has emerged as a bit character in the story lines around the investigation as a result of his payments to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, who has been convicted and pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Democrats urged the Treasury Department to postpone the final decision on sanctions relief for Mr. Deripaska’s companies until after Mr. Mueller’s investigation concludes.And the party’s congressional leaders began pushing resolutions in the Senate and the House this week to override the sanctions relief. The resolutions were introduced under a provision in a 2017 law that allows Congress to override certain sanctions-related decisions by the Treasury Department. Under the provision, both the House and the Senate would need to pass resolutions by a Thursday deadline to block the administration’s move to lift the sanctions. Failing congressional action, the sanctions would automatically be lifted.The Democrats’ efforts at first seemed to stand little chance, given efforts to stifle them by the administration and the Republicans who control the Senate.Mr. Mnuchin visited Republican senators on Tuesday before the vote to implore them to support the sanctions relief. The appearance followed a briefing to the House last week in which he argued that the deal his agency negotiated with Mr. Deripaska’s companies would punish the oligarch by separating him from the companies, without having economic ripple effects. The briefing left Democratic leaders unconvinced.And Tuesday’s Senate vote indicated that Mr. Mnuchin’s assurances did not assuage doubts among the party’s Russia skeptics that the deal with Mr. Deripaska’s companies sufficiently decreased his control.“I don’t like the way it’s structured,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who voted with Democrats and has been among the party’s leading critics of Russia.The measure passed 57 to 42, with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, missing the vote as she announced her first step to start a campaign for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.The measure will face another Senate vote — this one requiring 60 votes — as soon as Wednesday.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, who introduced the resolution, foreshadowed the way his party intended to frame the fight if it does not get its way.“We’re only a few Republican votes short of the U.S. Senate telling Putin he can’t run the show no matter what President Trump and his administration try to do,” Mr. Schumer said. “If Republican senators agree with Leader McConnell, who said that Putin is a ‘thug’ — they’ll vote yes tomorrow.”In addition to Mr. Rubio, the other Republican senators who voted with Democrats were John Boozman of Arkansas, Susan Collins of Maine, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Steve Daines of Montana, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Martha McSally of Arizona, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Ben Sasse of Nebraska.Mr. Daines said keeping the sanctions in place would help “keep pressure on the Kremlin for their aggressive actions towards Eastern Europe, the Middle East and around the world.”The vote was a particularly stinging defeat for Mr. Mnuchin, who for the second time in less than a week tried to defend the decision to ease the sanctions to lawmakers on Capitol Hill to no avail.After being criticized by House Democrats last week for wasting their time in a classified briefing on the sanctions that they said offered little information, Mr. Mnuchin told Republican senators on Tuesday that upholding the department’s decision should not be political and that doing so was important to maintaining the integrity of the sanctions regime.But the sales pitch was not enough to hold Republicans together.Alan Rappeport and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

Deripaska, may have been less punitive than advertised.The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.With the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election continuing to shadow President Trump, the administration’s decision to lift sanctions on Mr. Deripaska’s companies has become a political flash point. House Democrats won widespread Republican support last week for their efforts to block the sanctions relief deal. Democratic hopes of blocking the administration’s decision have been stifled by the Republican-controlled Senate.The Treasury Department announced the sanctions last April against Mr. Deripaska, six other Russian oligarchs and their companies, including Mr. Deripaska’s aluminum giant, Rusal, as well as the holding company that owns it, EN+, and another company it controls, EuroSibEnergo. Like other oligarchs, Mr. Deripaska is closely allied with the Kremlin.The sanctions were in retaliation for “a range of malign activity around the globe” by Russia, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said at the time.The personal sanctions on Mr. Deripaska went into effect immediately, but those on his companies were delayed several times, and Mr. Mnuchin struck a conciliatory tone toward the companies. He clarified that the goal of the sanctions was “to change the behavior” of Mr. Deripaska, and “not to put Rusal out of business,” given the company’s pivotal role as a global supplier of aluminum.Mr. Mnuchin indicated that the Treasury Department might be willing to lift the sanctions from Mr. Deripaska’s companies if he reduced his stake to less than 50 percent.ImageSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week to back the sanctions deal.CreditAlex Brandon/Associated PressLast month, Mr. Mnuchin announced that the department had reached an agreement to lift the sanctions on Mr. Deripaska’s companies in exchange for a commitment “to significantly diminish Deripaska’s ownership and sever his control.”The department laid out the broad contours of the agreement in a letter to Congress, which was released publicly. But the confidential document, which was not released publicly but was reviewed by The New York Times, describes the deal in considerably greater detail, including proprietary information about the corporate restructuring, much of it not previously reported.It shows that the sanctions relief deal will allow Mr. Deripaska to wipe out potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in debt by transferring some of his shares to VTB, a Russian government-owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent him large sums of money.The confidential document, titled “Terms of Removal,” also shows that the agreement would leave allies of Mr. Deripaska and the Kremlin with significant stakes in his companies. The document is signed by executives representing Mr. Deripaska’s three companies as well as the official in the Treasury Department who oversees the division that handled the negotiations.The new information could lend ammunition to criticism that the Trump administration either knowingly let a Kremlin-allied oligarch off easy, or was outmaneuvered by a sophisticated legal and lobbying campaign funded by his companies.Mr. Deripaska has attracted particular attention because he has been a bit character in the story lines around the Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Deripaska had a business relationship with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort has been convicted and pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team.In response to questions about the details outlined in the confidential document, the Treasury Department issued a statement broadly defending the deal, citing provisions that keep Mr. Deripaska and his allies from exerting voting control of some of their shares.“Deripaska’s control over these entities is severed by this delisting, and he can no longer use them to carry out illicit activities on behalf of the Kremlin,” the statement said. “En+, Rusal and ESE have committed to provide Treasury with an unprecedented level of transparency into their dealings to ensure that Deripaska does not reassert control. Treasury will be vigilant in ensuring these commitments are met, and failure to comply will bring swift consequences, including the reimposition of sanctions.”ImageVTB Bank, a Russian government-owned bank whose main building in Moscow is at center, will receive additional shares in the business empire of Mr. Deripaska.CreditSergei Karpukhin/ReutersYet Mr. Deripaska’s associates have privately expressed satisfaction with the deal. And representatives for EN+ suggested to at least one prospective outside buyer who expressed interest in Mr. Deripaska’s shares that the company would only consider selling to an independent investor as a fall back option if Treasury did not approve the restructuring agreement.The publicly released letter sent to Congress said the under the agreement to lift the corporate sanctions, Mr. Deripaska would reduce his ownership stake in EN+ from approximately 70 percent to 44.95 percent. That would include a “restructuring transaction” with a Swiss mining company with which he has worked closely, Glencore, and the transfer of one block of his EN+ stock to VTB Bank and another to a charitable foundation.The letter did not identify either the number of shares to be transferred, or the name of the foundation. And it stressed that “none of the transactions to be undertaken consistent with the agreement will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in return for his shares or from future dividends” issued by his companies, which “will be placed into a blocked account.”But the unreleased, confidential document contains raw numbers, names and other details that raise questions about the degree to which the deal is penalizing Mr. Deripaska.The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from stray dog rescue to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal’s biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them — in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.ImageAnother Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, owns a stake in Mr. Deripaska’s empire. He also faces sanctions from the United States.CreditPool photo by Alexander RyuminNotably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.Another Russian oligarch who faces sanctions by the United States and has attracted the interest of Mr. Mueller’s investigators, Viktor Vekselberg, also has a stake in Mr. Deripaska’s empire through a company called SUAL Partners Limited. Another investor in SUAL Partners is Len Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born billionaire who has British and American citizenship. He donated $1 million through another company he controls to the committee that funded Mr. Trump’s inaugural festivities, which Mr. Vekselberg attended and to which Mr. Blavatnik was invited.According to the confidential document, under the restructuring agreement approved by the Treasury Department, SUAL would own 22.5 percent of Rusal, while EN+ would own 56.88 percent of Rusal.The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.In its letter to Congress outlining the deal, Treasury stressed that independent trustees with “no personal or professional ties” to Mr. Deripaska will control the EN+ board votes associated with the shares owned by Mr. Deripaska’s foundation, his ex-wife, her father and the family-linked Orandy Capital, as well as those being transferred to VTB.The deal also requires Mr. Deripaska to hand over voting authority for 10 percent of his shares to “a voting trust obligated to vote in the same manner as the majority of shares held by shareholders other than Deripaska.”Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.“Score that a win for Putin,” tweeted Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Sanction Deal Could Benefit Russian Mogul.

Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer, said Mr. Trump recalled that the discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow were “going from the day I announced to the day I won.”CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman and Michael S. SchmidtJan. 20, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump was involved in discussions to build a skyscraper in Moscow throughout the entire 2016 presidential campaign, his personal lawyer said on Sunday, a longer and more significant role for Mr. Trump than he had previously acknowledged.The comments by his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani indicated that Mr. Trump’s efforts to complete a business deal in Russia waned only after Americans cast ballots in the presidential election.The new timetable means that Mr. Trump was seeking a deal at the time he was calling for an end to economic sanctions against Russia imposed by the Obama administration. He was seeking a deal when he gave interviews questioning the legitimacy of NATO, a favorite talking point of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. And he was seeking a deal when, in July 2016, he called on Russia to release hacked Democratic emails that Mr. Putin’s government was rumored at the time to have stolen.The Trump Tower Moscow discussions were “going on from the day I announced to the day I won,” Mr. Giuliani quoted Mr. Trump as saying during an interview with The New York Times. It was one of a flurry of interviews Mr. Giuliani did on Sunday amid fallout from a disputed report by BuzzFeed News that President Trump had personally directed his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie to Congress about the negotiations over the skyscraper.Mr. Giuliani denied that claim, and a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, called BuzzFeed’s report “inaccurate” in a rare statement.Mr. Giuliani also acknowledged that Mr. Trump might have talked to Mr. Cohen before his congressional testimony but he said his client had never instructed Mr. Cohen to lie. Mr. Trump acknowledged discussing the Moscow project with Mr. Cohen in written responses that the president gave Mr. Mueller’s investigators days before they revealed that Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty to lying to Congress.“There was no question that he was asked by the special counsel a question that said, ‘Did you talk to him before he testified?’” Mr. Giuliani said.“There were questions like, ‘Did you talk about the Moscow project with Michael Cohen?’ to which we answered yes.”Later in the day, Mr. Giuliani said he was merely allowing for the possibility that the president and Mr. Cohen could have discussed the Moscow project through the election but that no notes or call logs indicated specific conversations about Russia.“We’re at Cohen’s mercy for the dates,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the president “doesn’t remember the dates. He does remember conversations about Moscow. He does remember the letter of intent. He does remember, after that, fleeting conversations.”He added that he was trying to keep Mr. Trump from legal exposure if prosecutors uncover evidence of a conversation that the president has said he does not recall.Like so many other threads of the Russia saga, the story that the president’s aides have told about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations has changed repeatedly. First, they said that the discussions never moved beyond their infancy, barely involved Mr. Trump, and ended well before the Republican primaries. Then, when Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about the Tower negotiations, the special counsel’s office revealed they extended at least until the middle of 2016.When — and even if — the discussions officially ended remains unclear, and Mr. Giuliani did not provide clarity.Even after Mr. Trump secured a surprise victory in November 2016 — and as evidence was mounting that the Russians had carried out a sophisticated campaign to disrupt the presidential election — Mr. Trump’s top aides took part in numerous meetings and phone conversations with Russians that have been a focus of Mr. Mueller’s investigation.Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions and asked Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak, whether Mr. Trump’s aides could use phone lines at the Russian embassy to communicate with Moscow during the presidential transition. Michael T. Flynn, who would become President Trump’s first national security adviser, discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak numerous times in December 2016 as President Obama punished Russia for its campaign of election interference.Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty a year later to lying to F.B.I. agents about his communications with Mr. Kislyak.The tangled, yearslong negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow were emblematic of the process Mr. Trump used to stamp his name on luxury buildings around the world — developing relationships with foreign businessmen and government officials to navigate the byzantine world of international real estate.For the Moscow project, Mr. Trump appears to have relied on Mr. Cohen to be the lead negotiator, and interviews, emails and court documents show that Mr. Cohen made a vigorous effort to try to get the blessing of the Kremlin for the project and even tried to arrange a trip to Moscow for Mr. Trump.His partner in the effort was Felix Sater, a former felon who had also performed work for Mr. Trump and had deep contacts in Russian business and political circles. Mr. Sater cultivated this web of contacts for years, from when he was secretly working for American intelligence agencies during the 1990s — work that prompted federal authorities to reduce Mr. Sater’s penalty after a guilty plea in a securities fraud case.In late 2015, months after Mr. Trump announced his presidential candidacy, Mr. Sater sent an enthusiastic message to Mr. Cohen bragging about how he would tap his Russian connections for the tower project and “get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this.”“Buddy,” Mr. Sater wrote, “our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.”Mr. Sater later testified to the House Intelligence Committee that his boastful emails overstated his ties to the Kremlin, and his message about getting Mr. Trump elected meant only that he thought the Trump Tower deal might generate publicity for the campaign.One of the people Mr. Sater contacted was Evgeny Shmykov, a former general in Russian military intelligence who once worked with anti-Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Mr. Sater appears to have seen Mr. Shmykov as a conduit to get Russian government approval for the Trump project.According to emails reviewed by The Times, Mr. Sater sent an urgent message to Mr. Cohen in late 2015 saying that Mr. Shmykov was on the phone and he needed passport information for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump so they could receive visas.Mr. Sater said that, for diplomatic reasons, the Kremlin could not issue the visas. Instead, he said, a Russian bank could provide the documents as part of “a business meeting not political.”The Moscow trip for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen never materialized, but court documents released in November as part of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea showed that Mr. Cohen pursued the Moscow project well into 2016.He made numerous attempts to reach Mr. Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, who arranged for Mr. Cohen to speak to another Kremlin official. Mr. Cohen told prosecutors for the special counsel that, during a January 2016 conversation, the Kremlin official “asked detailed questions and took notes, stating that she would follow up with others in Russia.”Mr. Cohen told prosecutors that the discussions lasted at least until June 14, 2016, when he met with Mr. Sater in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York and told him he would not be traveling to Russia “at that time,” according to court documents. On the same day, The Washington Post reported that Russian operatives had infiltrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee — the first public evidence of Moscow’s campaign to disrupt the election.Now, based on Mr. Giuliani’s remarks on Sunday, it appears that the negotiations over the Moscow skyscraper deal continued even months beyond that.President Trump did not elaborate on his lawyer’s remarks, but in November said there was nothing wrong with him pursuing a deal to enlarge his business empire at the same time he hoped to become president of the United States.“There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?” the president said.Mr. Trump said he ultimately decided not to go through with the project — without saying how long the discussions lasted.But, he added, “There would have been nothing wrong if I did do it.”Mark Mazzetti and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Vogel, Scott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Iuliia MendelJan. 10, 2019WASHINGTON — Hours after he was sworn in as America’s 45th president, Donald J. Trump and his wife, Melania, swayed together to a rendition of the Frank Sinatra classic “My Way,” as hundreds of their wealthiest and most influential supporters held aloft smartphones to capture the Trumps’ first dance following the inauguration.Serhiy Kivalov, a Ukrainian lawmaker known for pro-Russian initiatives, took photos of the dance, as well as of his coveted tickets and passes to the soiree where it took place, the Liberty Ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, posting them on Facebook and declaring that “it was an honor” to attend.He was one of at least a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures who made their way to Washington for the inauguration, several of whom attended the Liberty Ball. Most had more on their dance cards than just parties.They attended meetings and orchestrated encounters at Trump International Hotel with influential Republican members of Congress and close allies of President Trump. Representing a range of views, including a contingent seen as sympathetic to Moscow, they positioned themselves as brokers who could help solve one of the thorniest foreign policy problems facing the new administration — the ugly military stalemate between Russia and Ukraine and the tough sanctions imposed on Moscow following its seizure of Crimea.The transition of power in Washington attracted officials and business executives from around the world seeking entree and influence with the new administration. While many parties and other gatherings during that period were open to anyone, packages for more exclusive events organized by Mr. Trump’s presidential inaugural committee started at $25,000 for two tickets to one of the official black tie balls and other events, according to a brochure listing inaugural committee “underwriter benefits.”Evidence of the Ukrainians’ presence eventually prompted interest from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and has spawned a number of related inquiries by federal prosecutors. The investigations are playing out against growing indications that some of the Ukrainians who came to Washington for the inaugural, or their allies, were promoting grand bargains, or “peace” plans, that aligned with Russia’s interests, including by lifting sanctions.Such a deal would not just have given the new administration additional flexibility to bring Moscow into American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, but could also have eased the way for a cast of characters with ties to Mr. Trump — some of whom in turn had ties to the Ukrainians who came to Washington — to move ahead on business deals that had been complicated by the sanctions.ImageAn image posted to Facebook on Jan. 21, 2017, shows Serhiy Kivalov, a lawmaker from Ukraine, attending the Liberty Ball, part of Mr. Trump’s inauguration.Federal prosecutors have asked witnesses about how some of the Ukrainians gained access to inauguration events, whom they met with while they were in the United States, and what they discussed — including questions about various peace plan proposals — according to people with direct knowledge of the questions and others who were briefed on the interviews.As recently as last month, prosecutors were asking witnesses about illegal foreign lobbying related to Ukraine. Another subject of questions has been whether foreigners from Ukraine and other countries used straw donors to disguise donations to the inaugural committee. Federal law prohibits foreigners from contributing to an inaugural committee, although they can attend events if Americans buy the tickets.Elements of the investigations have gotten new visibility in recent weeks.Lawyers for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was paid tens of millions of dollars over the last dozen years by Russia-aligned Ukrainian interests, inadvertently revealed on Tuesday that he had communicated about a Ukraine-Russia peace plan with a business associate believed to have ties to Russian intelligence.The associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, is a Russian citizen who has been charged by Mr. Mueller with obstruction of justice for trying to shape the testimony of witnesses to the events that led to charges of illegal foreign lobbying against Mr. Manafort.Mr. Kilimnik was said in the inadvertently disclosed portions of the court filing to have received political polling data from Mr. Manafort in 2016. Mr. Manafort relayed a request to have Mr. Kilimnik pass the polling data to two Ukrainian oligarchs who had arranged or provided financing for Russia-aligned Ukrainian political parties for which Mr. Manafort had worked. One of the oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin, attended the Liberty Ball, according to one person familiar with the guest list and another who saw him there.Last month, prosecutors made a move that was seen as signaling the continuing cooperation of Sam Patten, an American consultant who had worked with Mr. Kilimnik and Russia-aligned Ukrainians looking to build ties to the Trump administration.Mr. Patten had pleaded guilty in late August to charges including funneling $50,000 in money from an unnamed foreigner who matched the description of Mr. Lyovochkin but was described in court papers only as “a prominent Ukraine oligarch” to buy tickets to exclusive Trump inauguration events for the oligarch, Mr. Kilimnik and someone described only as “another Ukrainian.”ImageUkrainian soldiers looked toward incoming Russian troops in Belbek, Crimea, in 2014.

Artemenko, who came to the inauguration as a Ukrainian member of Parliament bearing a peace proposal that was later criticized as pro-Russian.Mr. Artemenko said he had testified before Mr. Mueller’s grand jury last summer and had answered questions from the Mueller team “about what is my purpose of this trip, how I can get there, and what I did, how I got invitations and tickets and stuff.”On Capitol Hill, investigators from the House Oversight Committee, now under Democratic control, are looking into Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, who was a central player in the effort to build a new relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.How active a role Mr. Flynn played in the discussions about a peace plan for Ukraine is unclear, but congressional investigators have been pursuing whether he or his former business partners might have gained financially if the sanctions on Russia were ended.The committee, whose chairman is Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, is continuing to pursue its investigation of Mr. Flynn’s business dealings and “his potential misuse of his public position when he was national security adviser,” a committee spokeswoman said.In 2017, a whistle-blower told committee investigators that Mr. Flynn had mentioned to a business associate around the time of the inauguration that the Russia sanctions would be “ripped up” as one of the administration’s first acts. Mr. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistle-blower.ImageAndrii V. Artemenko, a former Ukrainian lawmaker, said he had been interrogated by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.CreditValentyn Ogirenko/ReutersMr. Flynn had been part of a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but after his direct involvement ended, he remained close with people involved in the project.In a December 2017 letter to the Oversight Committee, an officer of the company that hired Mr. Flynn as an adviser on the project, ACU Strategic Partners, said that the allegations of the whistle-blower were “false and unfounded.”Mr. Flynn subsequently intersected with one of the Ukrainian efforts to resolve the problems with Russia.Mr. Artemenko, the former Ukrainian lawmaker, said in an interview that he did not attend any inaugural balls or other events that required paid tickets. Instead, he said he watched Mr. Trump’s inaugural address, which was free, and met with various Republicans to discuss his peace plan, which would have lifted sanctions against Russia and which he said had some support from the Kremlin.Days after the inauguration, Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York to discuss his peace plan with Michael D. Cohen, who was then Mr. Trump’s lawyer, and a former business partner of the president’s, Felix H. Sater, who had helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia. Mr. Cohen subsequently hand-delivered the peace plan to Mr. Flynn a week before Mr. Flynn was forced to resign after being caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador.Within days of the inauguration, the White House made inquiries to the State Department and Congress about what might be required to ease the sanctions. Resetting relations with the Russian government and Mr. Putin had been central to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy approach during the campaign, the transition and the first days of the new administration, and it is unclear what role, if any, the back-channel Ukrainian entreaties might have played.The official inquiries about an abrupt policy shift set off alarms at the State Department and in Congress.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.CreditJames Hill for The New York Times“I heard from various sources that there was a plan to summarily lift sanctions on Russia,” said Daniel Fried, a veteran diplomat who stayed on for the first several weeks of the Trump administration as the State Department’s coordinator for sanctions policy. “I was approached by people who were nervous that the United States was about to do something irretrievably stupid.”Several other officials, some of whom would speak only on the condition of anonymity, also recalled jarring questions from the new National Security Council under Mr. Flynn, including whether Ukraine was really part of Russia and whether Crimea wanted to be part of Russia.Even among Republicans, the idea of easing sanctions found little support. “If there’s any country in the world that doesn’t deserve sanctions relief, it’s Russia,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said in an interview with Politico a week after the inauguration.By March 2017, the White House’s sanctions relief trial balloon had wilted amid opposition from congressional leaders.But that has not stopped the prosecutorial scrutiny of those pushing plans to lift the sanctions around the inauguration, and their roles in prospective business deals that might have benefited from the lifting of the sanctions.Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including lying to congressional investigators about negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow. While Mr. Cohen had initially echoed Mr. Trump’s claim that talks about the Moscow project had ended before the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Cohen admitted in his guilty plea that they extended into the summer of 2016.By then, Russia was engaged in a surreptitious hacking and social media campaign to bolster Mr. Trump, who was publicly pressing for warmer relations with Russia, including signaling a willingness to consider lifting sanctions.ImageAt least a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures made their way to Washington for Mr. Trump’s inauguration.CreditDamon Winter/The New York TimesThe sanctions posed a potential obstacle for the Trump Tower Moscow project, in which Mr. Sater, who is Russian-American, had positioned himself as a key player. Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen discussed financing from two Russian banks, VTB and GenBank, but the sanctions prohibited American citizens and companies from doing business with either of them, according to reporting by The New York Times and BuzzFeed.Another prominent businessman who had worked with Mr. Trump years earlier to try to erect a Trump building in Moscow, the Ukrainian-Russian developer Pavel Fuks, also was in Washington for the inauguration.Mr. Fuks, who has since fallen out of favor in Moscow and was placed under sanctions by the Kremlin, stayed at Trump International Hotel, and spent time with Vitaliy Khomutynnik, a businessman and parliamentarian who had been a member of the Russia-aligned party for which Mr. Manafort worked. Mr. Fuks and Mr. Khomutynnik talked with Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Ed Royce, both influential California Republicans at the time.Mr. Khomutynnik’s party posted photos of him with the congressmen on Facebook, and suggested that he extracted assurances that American-Ukrainian relations would grow stronger under Mr. Trump, without detailing any specific policy discussions.Mr. McCarthy’s office said that the encounter was random, and that the conversation was brief and perfunctory, and noted that Mr. McCarthy has supported sanctions against Russia.In Ukraine, a parliamentarian affiliated with the president, Petro Poroshenko, who is generally regarded as pro-Western, accused rival politicians of paying as much as $200,000 for inaugural tickets.Mr. Kivalov, the Ukrainian lawmaker who posted photos of the Trumps’ dance, did not respond to requests for comment about how he got his tickets to the Liberty Ball. Borislav Bereza, a Ukrainian lawmaker who posted a photo of himself in a tuxedo at the ball, said he got his tickets free from someone “connected to Illinois,” though he said, “I don’t remember for sure.”He attributed the claims about Ukrainians’ paying for tickets to jealousy from those who were not invited, and in a Facebook post he characterized the ball as “a place where, over a glass of champagne, you are introduced to people who have influence in the new administration of the White House. These are the traditions of the United States.”Kenneth P. Vogel, Scott Shane and Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Iuliia Mendel from Kiev, Ukraine.

TrumpHe is demonstrably unfit for office. What are we waiting for?By David LeonhardtOpinion ColumnistJan. 5, 2019Image CreditCreditMike McQuade, photograph by Damon Winter/The New York TimesThe presidential oath of office contains 35 words and one core promise: to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Since virtually the moment Donald J. Trump took that oath two years ago, he has been violating it.He has repeatedly put his own interests above those of the country. He has used the presidency to promote his businesses. He has accepted financial gifts from foreign countries. He has lied to the American people about his relationship with a hostile foreign government. He has tolerated cabinet officials who use their position to enrich themselves.To shield himself from accountability for all of this — and for his unscrupulous presidential campaign — he has set out to undermine the American system of checks and balances. He has called for the prosecution of his political enemies and the protection of his allies. He has attempted to obstruct justice. He has tried to shake the public’s confidence in one democratic institution after another, including the press, federal law enforcement and the federal judiciary.The unrelenting chaos that Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it’s becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it?The easy answer is to wait — to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.ImagePresident Trump meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House on Wednesday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesSome of the biggest moderating influences have recently left the administration. The defense secretary who defended our alliances with NATO and South Korea is gone. So is the attorney general who refused to let Trump subvert a federal investigation into himself. The administration is increasingly filled with lackeys and enablers. Trump has become freer to turn his whims into policy — like, say, shutting down the government on the advice of Fox News hosts or pulling troops from Syria on the advice of a Turkish autocrat.The biggest risk may be that an external emergency — a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster — will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.For the country’s sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.Achieving this outcome won’t be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.But if removing him will not be easy, it’s not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. From the beginning, Trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. Although members of Congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.Since the midterm election showed the political costs that Trump inflicts on Republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. They have broken with him on foreign policy (in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. Trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more Russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. When support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.[Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter — with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]Before we get to the how of Trump’s removal, though, I want to spend a little more time on the why — because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. Unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of Congress no less.So let’s be clear. Trump’s ideology is not an impeachable offense. However much you may disagree with Trump’s tax policy — and I disagree vehemently — it is not a reason to remove him from office. Nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. Such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. These issues are not the “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” that the founders intended impeachment to address. Yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible. They insisted on including an impeachment clause in the Constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often. And they understood how much harm such a person could do. The country needed a way to address what Alexander Hamilton called “the abuse or violation of some public trust” and James Madison called the “incapacity, negligence or perfidy” of a president. The negligence and perfidy of President Trump — his high crimes and misdemeanors — can be separated into four categories. This list is conservative. It does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with Russia, which remains uncertain. It also does not include his lazy approach to the job, like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule. It instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath. Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.Regardless of party, Trump’s predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities. They released their tax returns, so that any potential conflicts would be public. They placed their assets in a blind trust, to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments.Trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity. He has continued to own and promote the Trump Organization. He has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars. ImageThe Trump International Hotel in Washington. CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesIf this pattern were merely petty corruption, without damage to the national interest, it might not warrant removal from office. But Trump’s focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy. Most worrisome, foreign officials and others have realized they can curry favor with the president by spending money at one of his properties. Saudi Arabia has showered the Trump Organization with business, and Trump has stood by the Saudis despite their brutal war in Yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic. A Chinese government-owned company reportedly gave a $500 million loan to a Trump-backed project in Indonesia; two days later, Trump announced that he was lifting sanctions on another well-connected Chinese company. These examples, and many more, flout Article 1 of the Constitution, which bans federal officeholders from accepting “emoluments” from any foreign country unless Congress approves the arrangement. Madison, when making the case for an impeachment clause, spoke of a president who “might betray his trust to foreign powers.”Then, of course, there is Russia. Even before Robert Mueller, the special counsel, completes his investigation, the known facts are damning enough in at least one way. Trump lied to the American people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and Vladimir Putin’s government. As president, Trump has taken steps — in Europe and Syria — that benefit Putin. To put it succinctly: The president of the United States lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy. ImagePresident Trump with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in July.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesCombine Trump’s actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials — including ones who have made shady stock trades, accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends — and the Trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in American history. It makes Warren G. Harding’s Teapot Dome scandal look like, well, a tempest in a teapot. Trump has violated campaign finance law.A Watergate grand jury famously described Richard Nixon as “an unindicted co-conspirator.” Trump now has his own indictment tag: “Individual-1.” Federal prosecutors in New York filed papers last month alleging that Trump — identified as Individual-1 — directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws. It happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when he instructed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay a combined $280,000 in hush money to two women with whom Trump evidently had affairs. Trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments, as required by law. In the two years since, Trump has lied publicly about them — initially saying he did not know about the payments, only to change his story later.ImagePresident Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen arriving at Federal Court in New York in December.CreditCorey Sipkin/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageMr. Cohen behind then-candidate Donald Trump during a campaign stop in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in 2016.CreditJonathan Ernst/ReutersIt’s worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office. But these payments were not most campaign finance violations. They involved large, secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that, prosecutors said, “deceived the voting public.” The seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason that the prosecutors filed criminal charges against Cohen, rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations.What should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behavior? The founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the Constitutional Convention. The most direct answer came from George Mason: A president who “practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance” should be subject to impeachment.Trump has obstructed justice.Whatever Mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump has obstructed justice to keep Mueller — and others — from getting to the truth.ImageProtesters gathered in front of the White House last November.CreditAndrew Harnik/Associated PressAgain and again, Trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades-old standards of presidential conduct. He pressured James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to let up on the Russia investigation, as a political favor. When Comey refused, Trump fired him. Trump also repeatedly pressured Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, to halt the investigation and ultimately forced Sessions to resign for not doing so. Trump has also publicly hounded several of the government’s top experts on Russian organized crime, including Andrew McCabe and Bruce Ohr. And Trump has repeatedly lied to the American people. He has claimed, outrageously, that the Justice Department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency. He has rejected, with no factual basis, the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about Russia’s role in the 2016 campaign. He reportedly helped his son Donald Trump Jr. draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. Obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president. It was the subject of the first Nixon article of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee. Among other things, that article accused him of making “false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.”Trump has subverted democracy.The Constitution that Trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances. It depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch. He is a citizen to whom, like all other citizens, the country’s laws apply. Trump rejects this principle. He has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests.It’s much more than just the Russia investigation. He has tried to delegitimize federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump has criticized the Justice Department for indicting Republican politicians during an election year. He has called for Comey, Hillary Clinton and other political opponents of his to be jailed.Trump has described journalists as “the enemy of the people” — an insult usually leveled by autocrats. He has rejected basic factual findings from the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office, research scientists and others. He has told bald lies about election fraud.Individually, these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office. Collectively, though, they exact a terrible toll on American society. They cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends — faith in elections, in the justice system, in the basic notion of truth.No other president since Nixon has engaged in behavior remotely like Trump’s. To accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it. Unpleasant though it is to remove a president, the costs and the risks of a continued Trump presidency are worse.What now?The most relevant precedent for the removal of Trump is Nixon, the only American president to be forced from office because of his conduct. And two aspects of Nixon’s departure tend to get overlooked today. One, he was never impeached. Two, most Republicans — both voters and elites — stuck by him until almost the very end. His approval rating among Republicans was still about 50 percent when, realizing in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed, he resigned.The current political dynamics have some similarities. Whether the House of Representatives, under Democratic control, impeaches Trump is not the big question. The question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of Republicans.ImageProtestors at Trump Tower in New York last year.CreditErik McGregor/Pacific Press, via LightRocket, via Getty ImagesI know that many of Trump’s critics have given up hoping that he ever will. They assume that Republican senators will go on occasionally criticizing him without confronting him. But it is a mistake to give up. The stakes are too large — and the chances of success are too real.Consider the following descriptions of Trump: “terribly unfit;” “erratic;” “reckless;” “impetuous;” “unstable;” “a pathological liar;” “dangerous to a democracy;” a concern to “anyone who cares about our nation.” Every one of these descriptions comes from a Republican member of Congress or of Trump’s own administration.They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.Democrats won’t persuade them by impeaching Trump. Doing so would probably rally the president’s supporters. It would shift the focus from Trump’s behavior toward a group of Democratic leaders whom Republicans are never going to like. A smarter approach is a series of sober-minded hearings to highlight Trump’s misconduct. Democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother Trump’s supporters, like corruption.If this approach works at all — or if Mueller’s findings shift opinion, or if a separate problem arises, like the economy — Trump’s Republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot. At his current approval rating of about 40 percent, Republicans were thumped in the midterms. Were his rating to fall further, a significant number of congressional Republicans would be facing long re-election odds in 2020.Two examples are Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, senators who, not coincidentally, have shown tentative signs of breaking with Trump on the government shutdown. The recent criticism from Mitt Romney — who alternates between critical and sycophantic, depending on his own political interests — is another sign of Trump’s weakness.For now, most Republicans worry that a full break with Trump will cause them to lose a primary, and it might. But sticking by him is no free lunch. Just ask the 27 Republican incumbents who were defeated last year and are now former members of Congress. By wide margins, suburban voters and younger voters find Trump abhorrent. The Republican Party needs to hold its own among these voters, starting in 2020.It’s not only that Trump is unfit to be president and that Republicans know it. It also may be the case that they will soon have a political self-interest in abandoning him. If they did, the end could come swiftly. The House could then impeach Trump, knowing the Senate might act to convict. Or negotiations could begin over whether Trump deserves to trade resignation for some version of immunity.Finally, there is the hope — naïve though it may seem — that some Republicans will choose to act on principle. There now exists a small club of former Trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom Trump has sullied, to greater or lesser degrees. It includes Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. Imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about Trump. Doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need. It would be an illustration of duty.Throughout his career, Trump has worked hard to invent his own reality, and largely succeeded. It has made him very rich and, against all odds, elected him president. But whatever happens in 2019, his false version of reality will not survive history, just as Nixon’s did not.

The admission is the latest twist in the onetime Trump loyalist’s deteriorating relationship with the president.CreditCreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesBy Maggie Haberman and Nicholas FandosJan. 10, 2019WASHINGTON — Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer who implicated him in a scheme to pay hush money to two women claiming to have had affairs with him, said on Thursday that he had agreed to testify before a House committee next month and give “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen’s decision to appear before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 7 sets the stage for a blockbuster public hearing that threatens to further damage the president’s image and could clarify the depth of his legal woes. Mr. Cohen, a consigliere to Mr. Trump when he was a real estate developer and presidential candidate as well as informally when he was president, was privy to the machinations of Mr. Trump’s inner circle and to key moments under scrutiny by both the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and federal prosecutors in New York.He could soon share many of them on national television under oath. But potential constraints emerged almost immediately on Thursday when the committee’s chairman warned that Mr. Cohen most likely would be barred by Mr. Mueller from discussing matters related to Russia.“In furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers,” Mr. Cohen said in a statement, “I have accepted the invitation by Chairman Elijah Cummings to appear publicly on Feb. 7. I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.”In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. In court, Mr. Cohen said that violation was the result of payments he made at the behest of his former client to a woman who was prepared to go public during the 2016 campaign about an affair with Mr. Trump years earlier.Since then, Mr. Cohen has spent more than 70 hours with federal prosecutors in Manhattan as well as with Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and Mr. Trump’s campaign. In November, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to an additional charge — lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016.That cooperation has earned him the ire of Mr. Trump, who has called Mr. Cohen a “weak person.” The president said he did nothing wrong regarding the campaign finance charge, and he accused his former lawyer of lying to prosecutors to try to get a reduced sentence. In court filings, prosecutors have not named Mr. Trump, referring to a “candidate for federal office” and “Individual-1.”Asked during a visit to the border in Texas whether he was concerned about Mr. Cohen’s plan to testify, Mr. Trump told reporters, “I’m not worried about it at all.”The subjects and level of detail that Mr. Cohen will be able to go into in public remain to be seen. Mr. Cummings said he was consulting Mr. Mueller’s office to ensure that he did not hinder its efforts, and that the special counsel’s team had indicated some areas — including interactions with Russia — that would most likely be off limits.How the Mueller Investigation Could Play Out for TrumpIf Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.“I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations,” Mr. Cummings said.Lawmakers of both parties have sought to protect Mr. Mueller since he was appointed. That is likely to be a key theme of the Senate confirmation hearing next week for Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, who could soon oversee the Mueller investigation. Democratic lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee sought assurances from Mr. Barr on Thursday that he would not interfere with the investigation as it wraps up. But they left private meetings with him saying that they would need a public pledge during his hearing.Mr. Cummings said in a brief interview on Thursday that he had known Mr. Cohen would testify for some time and had spoken with him when arranging the hearing.“He’ll have a chance to tell his side of the story, and we’ll have a chance to question him,” he said. “The American people deserve that.”In a CNN interview in December, Mr. Cummings compared Mr. Cohen’s appearance to that of John Dean, President Richard M. Nixon’s White House counsel, in 1973 before a special Senate committee investigating the Watergate scandal. Mr. Dean implicated himself, top administration officials and the president in a cover-up of the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters.“This is a watershed moment,” Mr. Cummings said, invoking Mr. Dean, who he said “changed the course of America” with his testimony.It was unclear whether Mr. Cohen’s agreement to testify before the Oversight Committee would preclude appearances, in public or private, before other House panels.The newly installed chairmen of at least two other panels have said they want to speak with Mr. Cohen about his work on behalf of Mr. Trump. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, said in an interview last week that he was in touch with Mr. Cohen’s lawyer about a possible appearance.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Schiff said he was glad to see Mr. Cohen would appear in public, but would press ahead in trying to secure a private appearance before his own committee “in the near future” to discuss matters related to Russia. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he too had an outstanding request for Mr. Cohen to come before his investigators.Democrats won back the House last year promising to hold Mr. Trump and his administration to account and have begun laying the groundwork for a long run of investigations targeting his administration’s policies and ethics lapses, Mr. Trump’s businesses and his campaign’s interactions with Russia. Mr. Cohen’s appearance in public, before national television cameras, will begin to fulfill that promise, but is likely to be only the first in a string of public testimony that could prove damaging to the president.Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, was not pleased with the announcement. Democrats, he said, had wasted no time in using the committee for “political theater rather than legitimate oversight.” He also pointed out that Mr. Cohen had already “admitted to providing intentionally false and misleading testimony to Congress” once before.

At 48, you’re basically a teenager in Democrat world, because some of the top House Democrats are close to 80. Will you be giving them advice on young-people stuff? Well, Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn are extremely hip in their own right, so I don’t believe they need any advice from me.In 2012, The Washington Post asked if you were Brooklyn’s Barack Obama. It’s a comparison you’ve heard a lot by now. How similar are you guys really? My mother has done a tremendous job of circulating talking points throughout the country. There is and will only ever be one Barack Obama, who was a phenomenal president. The only thing that I can definitively say we have in common is that we were both born on Aug. 4.Many people are already speculating that you’ll be a future speaker of the House. Is that kind of talk distracting? It’s not something that I really pay close attention to. During my time in public service, it’s become clear that you have to do the job that you currently have, do that job well and not get distracted. The rest tends to take care of itself.You represent Brooklyn, which has some of the fastest-gentrifying neighborhoods in the country. You also grew up there. When you see something like, say, an artisanal mayo shop opening in your neighborhood, how does that make you feel? What shocked me the most, to tell you the truth, was the moment a few years ago when I saw someone walking down Franklin Avenue carrying a surfboard in his hand, apparently on his way to the A train so he can go surf out on Rockaway Beach. Growing up in Crown Heights, it was not uncommon to hear gunshots going off every single day of the week during the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. Those days are gone, and it’s a much better place to be able to raise my sons, in the context of safety. Still, I would have never thought that I would have seen someone who looked like they were from Malibu walking on Franklin Avenue with a surfboard, without a care in the world.The Democrats are gearing up to unleash a number of investigations into the Trump administration. You’ve warned that the Democrats shouldn’t be overly aggressive in their oversight responsibilities. What would being overly aggressive look like? In my view, we have to remain focused on kitchen- table pocketbook issues that led us into the majority. If we were to go down the road of subpoenas flying out of the House of Representatives every other day over the next two years, that would be an example of overreaching in a fashion that could jeopardize our majority. We do have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch. However, we must do it in a way that is not overzealous.Based solely on what we know publicly now, do you think President Trump has committed impeachable offenses as president? The Mueller investigation has not been completed. I think we should all take a deep breath and allow Bob Mueller to be Bob Mueller and continue with his investigation.And what if he’s not allowed to complete that work? How confident are you that your Republican colleagues would do something about it? In the event that Trump provoked a constitutional crisis by terminating the Mueller investigation or suppressing its findings, certainly it’s my hope that my colleagues in the Senate would not conduct themselves as if they were members of a Trump-like cult but would function as a separate and coequal branch of government and push back hard against that type of overreach. But that’s a hypothetical, which I choose not to contemplate at this moment because it would really test the constitutional fabric of our democratic republic.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 54 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: Hakeem Jeffries Doesn’t Want To Be Called the Next Obama.

VogelJan. 17, 2019WASHINGTON — In what was most likely a largely symbolic vote, 136 House Republicans joined with Democrats on Thursday in an overwhelming show of disapproval of the Trump administration’s policy toward three Kremlin-aligned companies.The House voted 362 to 53 to block the Treasury Department from lifting sanctions against the companies, which are controlled by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska.Had a similar resolution also passed the Republican-controlled Senate, it would have blocked the Treasury Department’s move and led to the enforcement of the sanctions against the aluminum giant Rusal and two linked firms.But an effort by Senate Democrats failed on Wednesday to clear the 60-vote threshold required for passage, despite winning support from 11 Republicans.Thursday’s House vote, in which nearly 70 percent of House Republicans sided with Democrats and against the Trump administration, represented an even more dramatic display of Republican opposition to the move, signaling concerns within President Trump’s own party about his administration’s handling of a key aspect of its Russia policy.The congressional showdown over Russia sanctions comes at a time when Mr. Trump’s allies have increasingly struggled to address questions about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Mr. Trump, and whether Mr. Trump’s team coordinated with the effort.Democrats had urged the administration to delay its decision on the fate of the sanctions until the conclusion of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. They noted that Mr. Deripaska had emerged as a bit character in the story lines around the investigation as a result of his relationship with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort has been convicted of and pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team.Last April the Treasury Department announced sanctions on Mr. Deripaska, his companies and those of other Russian oligarchs in retaliation for the Russian meddling, casting the penalties as evidence that the administration was taking a tough stance against Moscow.While the sanctions went into effect against Mr. Deripaska personally, the sanctions against three of his companies were repeatedly delayed amid an aggressive lobbying and legal campaign by his companies and their allies. They argued that the corporate sanctions would have unintended economic ripple effects that would damage companies in the United States, Europe, Jamaica, Guinea and elsewhere by disrupting the supply of aluminum.The Treasury Department announced last month that it had negotiated a deal with Mr. Deripaska’s companies to lift the sanctions in exchange for a reduction of his control and ownership.But Democrats argued that the deal failed to do that, and merely shifted ownership and control to proxies of Mr. Deripaska and the Kremlin, including Mr. Deripaska’s charitable foundation, his former wife and the Russian bank VTB, which has also been put under sanctions.Unless the Senate revisits the measure, the Treasury Department is expected to lift the sanctions this month.The department quietly extended the deadline for carrying out the sanctions late Wednesday night, in a move that was seen as providing more time for Mr. Deripaska to sell his shares of the companies.Related CoverageMnuchin Defends Plan to Lift Sanctions on Russian Oligarch’s CompaniesJan. 10, 2019ImageRepublicans Break Ranks Over Move to Lift Sanctions on Russian Oligarch’s FirmsJan. 15, 2019ImageDemocrats Fall Short in Russia Sanctions VoteJan. 16, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsBarr: Trump’s Use of ‘Witch Hunt’ Is Understandable - Video - NYTimes.com

Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, said he had made hypothetical remarks about the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Maggie HabermanJan. 21, 2019President Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday walked back the timeline he had offered a day earlier on when negotiations ended with Russian officials about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow, calling his comments “hypothetical” and not intended to convey facts.The latest statement from the lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was described as a clarification of remarks he made to The New York Times in an interview on Sunday, as well as other remarks he made in interviews on Sunday television news shows.Mr. Giuliani originally quoted Mr. Trump as telling him the negotiations over a Moscow skyscraper continued through “the day I won.” He also said that the president recalled “fleeting conversations” about the deal after the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to pursue it.The confusion centers on how long Mr. Trump may have known of — or was apprised of — discussions about the Moscow tower proposal, which were led by his former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.The timeline of negotiations for the skyscraper is important because it shows that Mr. Trump’s company was involved in talks with an American adversary for a business deal through the general election, as he was demanding that President Barack Obama lift sanctions against Russia and urging its government to reveal emails from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.Even before the uproar over his comments, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that there were no call logs or annotations about conversations on the Moscow project that would provide accurate dates, and he described the president’s legal team as at Mr. Cohen’s “mercy.” As a result, he said, there could have been discussions to emerge later that Mr. Trump did not immediately recall.On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that Mr. Trump had said the discussions around the proposed tower were “going on from the day I announced to the day I won.” In television interviews the same day, he said that discussions about the tower might have continued up until November 2016 — the month Mr. Trump was elected president.But on Monday, Mr. Giuliani, in a widely issued statement, said that he was making hypothetical remarks.“My recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow ‘project’ were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the president,” Mr. Giuliani said.“My comments did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any such discussions,” he added. “The point is that the proposal was in the earliest stage and did not advance beyond a free nonbinding letter of intent.”Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty late last year to lying to Congress about the duration of the Moscow proposal; he had indicated initially that it stopped in January 2016.It was not the first time Mr. Giuliani has reversed himself in his comments about issues related to the investigation of Russian election interference that is being led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Last week, Mr. Giuliani backtracked from another surprising assertion that left open the possibility that Trump campaign aides might have coordinated with Russia in its election interference in 2016.“There was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form,” Mr. Giuliani said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating the president’s longstanding defense against accusations that his campaign secretly coordinated with Moscow to help swing the election. “Likewise, I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign.”He added, referring to discredited conspiracy theories that the president and his allies have long cited, “The only knowledge I have in this regard is the collusion of the Clinton campaign with Russia, which has so far been ignored.”A day earlier, Mr. Giuliani stopped short of defending Trump campaign aides, drawing speculation that he might have inside knowledge of possible coordination with Russia.“I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign,” he told CNN. He added: “I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack” the Democratic National Committee.When Mr. Giuliani was hired last April as the public face of Mr. Trump’s legal team, it was part of a strategy to be more aggressive in fighting back against Mr. Mueller. Some of the president’s closest allies believe that Mr. Giuliani was effective in helping change public opinion about the special counsel investigation — at least to some extent.Since then, however, Mr. Giuliani’s statements have included criticisms of the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan that he once led. That office, in the Justice Department’s Southern District of New York, last year secured guilty pleas by Mr. Cohen to a series of crimes, including a campaign finance-related charge that implicated Mr. Trump.Several people close to Mr. Trump have grown exasperated with Mr. Giuliani’s public appearances. They also expressed concern that he is increasing prosecutors’ anger with the president and potentially creating a misimpression about the Trump Tower project in Moscow.Mr. Giuliani’s appearances on the Sunday news shows followed an article on the website Buzzfeed last Friday, which reported that Mr. Mueller had amassed evidence that Mr. Trump “personally directed” Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the amount of time that the Moscow proposal was active.The special counsel’s office made the rare move of issuing a public statement about the article after it was published, calling it “inaccurate.”A person familiar with the discussions said that Mr. Trump’s lawyers sent a letter to the special counsel earlier in the day on Friday asking for a clarification. By then, several Democrats had discussed the prospect of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings if the article was true, creating a heightened degree of pressure on Mr. Mueller’s team.Democrats in Congress are preparing for the possibility of an impeachment case against Mr. Trump once Mr. Mueller completes his work. In the meantime, Mr. Cohen is scheduled to testify before Congress in an open hearing on Feb. 7.Since that date was announced, Mr. Trump has repeatedly urged prosecutors and the media to investigate Mr. Cohen’s family. Lanny Davis, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, has said his client fears for his safety and the safety of his family amid those threats.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Giuliani Calls Comments On Trump ‘Hypothetical’.

Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland, in July. Democrats have called on the interpreters from that and other meetings to testify about what was said.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Julian E. Barnes and Matthew RosenbergJan. 13, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump’s efforts to hide his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and new details about the F.B.I. inquiry into his ties to Moscow have intensified debate over his relationship with Russia, adding fuel to Democrats’ budding investigations of his presidency and potentially setting up a clash between the White House and Congress.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who now leads the Intelligence Committee as part of the new Democratic House majority, implored his Republican colleagues Sunday to support his effort to obtain notes or testimony from the interpreter in one of the private meetings between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.“Will they join us now?” Mr. Schiff wrote on Twitter. “Shouldn’t we find out whether our president is really putting ‘America first?’”The administration appears unlikely to acquiesce to such a demand without a fight.Mr. Trump has repeatedly withheld details of his conversations with Mr. Putin, according to current and former American officials, a practice that has left officials blind to the dynamic between the two leaders and intensified questions within the administration over the president’s actions.That development, first reported by The Washington Post, followed a report in The New York Times that the F.B.I. had earlier begun a counterintelligence investigation on Mr. Trump to see whether he had been influenced by Russia when he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017.On Sunday, congressional Democrats said the steps Mr. Trump took to keep his conversations secret brought forth uncomfortable questions about the relations between the two men and why the American president echoed some of Mr. Putin’s positions.“Why is he so chummy with Vladimir Putin, this man who is a former K.G.B. agent, never been a friend to the United States, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world and tries his damnedest to undermine our elections?” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Why is this President Trump’s best buddy? I don’t get it.”Mr. Trump went so far as to take the notes from the interpreter who worked with him during a private meeting with Mr. Putin at the 2017 Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany.Image“Why is this President Trump’s best buddy?” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked about Mr. Putin. “I don’t get it.”CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesA former senior administration official said a number of top figures in the administration sought in the hours and days after the meeting to find out details of what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had discussed. But Mr. Trump waved off their queries, leaving the officials to rely solely on a brief readout that Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state at the time, had provided to the news media, according to the former official.Several administration officials asked the interpreter what had been discussed. But the interpreter told them that the president had taken the notes after the meeting, and had instructed the translator not to discuss the meeting, the former official said.Last year both House and Senate Democrats called on Mr. Trump’s interpreters to testify on the president’s meetings with Mr. Putin, including the leaders’ July summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Trump’s news conference in Helsinki, in which he questioned his own intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election, prompted bipartisan criticism.Mr. Trump’s failure to allow other officials into the room or share notes of the meeting has become something of a Rorschach test inside the government.For opponents of the president, there are no innocent explanations for Mr. Trump’s actions, which are possible evidence that Mr. Trump has colluded with Russia, a question at the heart of the special counsel inquiry. For supporters, Mr. Trump’s actions are evidence that he must go to extreme lengths to prevent leaks and is a nontraditional politician pursuing new approaches to old problems.Republicans defended Mr. Trump on Sunday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that any notion the president was a threat to American security “is absolutely ludicrous.”Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, defended Mr. Trump’s choice to talk privately with Mr. Putin or other leaders.“I know what the president likes to do,” Mr. McCarthy said on “Face the Nation.” “He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship, like he does with other world leaders around.”The F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia was taken over by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. While it is not clear what Mr. Mueller has done with the investigation, there are some clues that he has pursued at least parts of it.While many of the questions Mr. Mueller submitted to Mr. Trump were focused on accusations of obstruction of justice against the president, others had to do with the president’s relationship with Russia.ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, defended Mr. Trump’s choice to talk privately with Mr. Putin or other leaders.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesMr. Mueller asked Mr. Trump whether he had any discussions during the campaign about any meetings with Mr. Putin and whether he spoke to others about American sanctions against Russia.While Mr. Trump did not answer Mr. Mueller’s questions about obstruction, he did answer the questions about Russia, although what the president said is not known.The revelation about the earlier F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation prompted Republicans to renew their criticism of the bureau.Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and fierce defender of Mr. Trump, told Fox News he was going to ask Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, if the bureau had begun a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump.Mr. Graham said there should be checks inside the bureau to prevent such an investigation.“I find it astonishing, and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the F.B.I.,” Mr. Graham said. “I don’t trust them as far as I throw them.”As Democrats press ahead in their investigation of Mr. Trump’s meetings with Mr. Putin, it is not clear what information they will be able to extract from the White House.There are no reports inside the government on what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed in their meetings, current and former officials said.Without official detailed notes about Mr. Trump’s conversations, senior officials in the administration have had to rely on intelligence reports about what the Russians were saying to one another after the meeting. There are limits to what officials could glean from the intelligence, current and former officials said. And the Russians could hardly be considered reliable narrators, even with one another.While that frustrated some in the government, the former senior administration official said he was not unsympathetic to Mr. Trump’s predicament. The official said the president feared that whatever he said to Mr. Putin would be twisted by critics.But because access to meetings and transcripts was tightened after early leaks, some officials believed Mr. Trump’s decision to take the notes was too extreme and raised questions about what he was trying to keep private, the former official said.Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Democrats Want Notes From Trump-Putin Talk.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|William Barr Hearing: Senators Press Barr on Criminal Justice OverhaulAdvertisementSupported byWilliam Barr Hearing: Senators Press Barr on Criminal Justice OverhaulBy The New York TimesWilliam P. Barr appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday for the first day of his confirmation hearing for attorney general. Mr. Barr pledged to allow the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to finish his investigation and promised to withstand political pressure from President Trump or other forces, saying his age, 68, and experience freed him to act independently. Mr. Barr unexpectedly qualified some of his unusually expansive views of executive power. He emphasized legal limits on the presidency and law enforcement independence. Mr. Barr defended as “entirely proper” an unsolicited memo he wrote criticizing Mr. Mueller’s examination of whether the president obstructed justice. VideoWilliam P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, said “it is in the best interest of everyone” that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, be allowed to finish his investigation. He also pledged not to allow the president to “correct and put spin on” a Mueller report before it was released publicly.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Timeskey momentBarr pledged to allow Mueller to finish his work.Mr. Barr used his opening remarks to the committee to clarify that he has no intention of firing Mr. Mueller before his work is done and to indicate that he would provide “as much transparency as I can consistent with the law” around the investigation’s results. The rule of law, he insisted, should be above and outside of the politics that divide the nation.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said. He added: “I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish.”Mr. Mueller is believed to be in the final stages of his inquiry, which he took over from the F.B.I. in May 2017 after agents opened it nearly two and a half years ago.“The country needs a credible resolution of these issues,” Mr. Barr said.The fate of Mr. Mueller’s findings — an expected report — was a recurring topic. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller’s report to the attorney general will be “confidential,” but the attorney general will then produce his own report to Congress based on that material. He said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand-jury secrecy rules, but that he would not let the White House edit or change it, as the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested may happen.“That will not happen,” Mr. Barr said.— Nicholas Fandos7:39 P.M.Barr recalibrated his claim comparing Uranium One to election interference. Throughout the hearing, Mr. Barr espoused surprisingly more moderate views than he has previously, and not only about presidential power and law-enforcement independence. He also found himself backpedaling a bit when pressed about his defense of Mr. Trump's push for an investigation into Hillary Clinton. Mr. Barr had said in 2017 that he saw far more basis to investigate the Obama administration’s approval of the sale of a Canadian mining company to a Russian state-owned corporation than to investigate possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia’s election interference.The sale, which was approved while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, has been the subject of a conspiracy theory about Mrs. Clinton and her family’s foundation that circulates in some conservative circles despite being debunked.Mr. Barr initially suggested his comment, which appeared in a New York Times article, had been mischaracterized. The reporter who wrote the article, Peter Baker, tweeted Mr. Barr’s 2017 email containing the comment in full, putting to rest the possibility of misinterpretation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, later read aloud from the tweeted email during the hearing, noting that Mr. Barr had testified earlier about the seriousness of Russia’s election meddling and pressing him about why he would assert that the Uranium One sale deserved more scrutiny. Mr. Barr hemmed and hawed, acknowledging that he had “no specific information about Uranium One that would say that it had not been handled appropriately” and that he did not mean the Clinton Foundation merited a criminal investigation.He suggested that he been “using it really as an example of the kinds of things that were floating around and some people felt had to be looked at” too, to make the point that calling for investigations into political opponents was bad: “I don’t subscribe to this ‘lock her up’ stuff,” he said, referring to a popular chant at Mr. Trump’s political rallies about jailing Mrs. Clinton.— Charlie Savage5:51 P.M.Barr backed the Justice Department view on indicting a sitting president.The Justice Department has held for decades time that indicting or criminally prosecuting a president while in office would violate the Constitution by undermining his ability to do his job. Despite a spirited legal debate about the validity of those opinions, Mr. Barr said he saw no reason to revisit them.“I actually haven’t read those opinions in a long time, but I see no reason to change them,” he said, in response to prompt by Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he believed the president could be indicted while in office and a trial postponed until his time there ended.— Nicholas Fandos5:32 P.M.A preview of what’s to come? Barr calls Trump’s use of ‘witch hunt’ understandable.VideoWilliam P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, said he gets the president’s position on the Mueller investigation. “Someone like you or me who doesn’t know the facts,” he said, might not use the same term as someone who feels he has been “falsely accused.”CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesDemocrats tried repeatedly to get Mr. Barr to chastise Mr. Trump for his attacks on federal law enforcement and condemn his fanciful use of facts. Mr. Barr did not take the bait, and his response may offer an early glimpse of how he might navigate one of the most uncomfortable positions in the government — overseeing and defending an investigation loathed by the president who nominated him.Even as he offered a consistent defense of Mr. Mueller (“I have the utmost respect for Bob”) and pledged to defend his investigation, Mr. Barr pointedly declined to criticize the president directing unrelenting attacks on investigators and elements of the Justice Department itself. And he said he was not concerned by what Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, called “the way Donald Trump undermines the institutions in our society that help us to maintain a moral consensus” with false information.Instead, Mr. Barr suggested that the president’s position was a reasonable one, at least as it pertained to the Mueller inquiry.“It’s understandable that if someone felt they were falsely accused they would view an investigation as something like a witch hunt where someone like you or me who doesn’t know the facts, you know, might not use that term,” Mr. Barr said.— Nicholas Fandos5:06 P.M.Resounding bipartisan support — for Barr’s grandson.Senators of both parties extended career guidance, praise and even snacks to Liam Daly, Mr. Barr’s young grandson who sat through the hourslong hearing.Liam’s parents are both Justice Department leaders, and he was deeply engaged in the confirmation process.“You are doing great so far,” he wrote in a note to Mr. Barr that was captured by a Reuters photographer. “I am having so much fun.”After Mr. Barr said that Russia posed a threat to the United States, Liam offered a subtle adjustment. “I think Russia’s people are fine,” he wrote to his grandfather. “The government is the problem.”Liam, 8, is also an avid reader of the children’s edition of The New York Times, a Justice Department official confirmed; Mr. Barr’s wife bought him a subscription. Liam found a recent article on the Supreme Court interesting, the official said.— Katie Benner4:10 P.M.Matthew who? The acting attorney general gets a pass.Senators have asked Mr. Barr about the last attorney general. They have called out former top F.B.I. officials by name. And they have spent an inordinate amount of time playfully counseling his grandson by name. But they have hardly mentioned the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker.Mr. Whitaker had proven to be a lightning rod for scrutiny since he took over the Justice Department when former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired late last year. He ignored the advice of ethics experts at the department and decided to take a direct role overseeing the Mueller investigation, an inquiry of which he has been highly critical, and Democrats argue that his temporary appointment was legally dubious in the first place.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced on Tuesday that they had reached an agreement for Mr. Whitaker to testify in public on Feb. 8. The committee’s chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he expected Mr. Whitaker to appear “whether or not the current lapse in appropriations has been resolved, and whether or not the Senate has confirmed a new attorney general.”— Nicholas Fandos4:03 P.M.‘The primary rival of the United States is China.’Mr. Barr took a hawkish stance on China that comports with the Trump administration’s view, calling it “the primary rival of the United States” and praising former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for cracking down on Chinese intellectual property theft and espionage.While he was general counsel of Verizon, Mr. Barr said, he was well aware of the potential national security threat posed by the Chinese telecommunications and tech equipment companies Huawei and ZTE. The intelligence community has long warned that firms were too close to the Chinese government and that they could use their products to monitor communications on behalf of Beijing.— Katie Benner3:35 P.M.Barr rules out waterboarding and other ‘enhanced interrogation techniques.’Under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Barr pledged to obey and uphold a 2015 law that restricts interrogators to the techniques listed in the Army Field Manual.“That was an important change because I think it gave clarity to the law and I will support that,” Mr. Barr said.Ms. Feinstein, who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee when it produced a lengthy investigative report about the C.I.A.’s torture program under the Bush administration, noted that it had relied upon secret memos by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel blessing techniques like extended sleep deprivation and the suffocation tactic known as waterboarding despite anti-torture laws.She also noted that in 2005, Mr. Barr had defended President Bush’s purported legal right to withhold Geneva Convention protections from terrorism detainees and to submit them to coercive interrogation, including “inflicting pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk” so long as it does not involve “the gratuitous barbarity involved in torture.”Pressed by Ms. Feinstein about whether waterboarding counted as torture, Mr. Barr said he did not know if it counted as such under the law in 2005, but that because of the newer law, “right now it’s prohibited, so, you know, the law has definitively dealt with that.”— Charlie Savage3:22 P.M.Senators pressed Barr on his views on criminal justice.Their tones were starkly different, but a coalition of liberal and conservative senators who teamed up last year to push into law major revisions to federal sentencing and prison laws pressed to make sure Mr. Barr understood that times had changed since he was last in office.“During your previous tenure as attorney general, you literally wrote the book on mass incarceration or wrote this report,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, referencing a 1992 Justice Department memorandum, “The Case for More Incarceration.” Mr. Booker urged Mr. Barr to say that the spike in incarceration caused by those policies had disproportionately affected black Americans.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sought assurances that Mr. Barr that he would implement the new bill, which lowers mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, promotes anti-recidivism programs, and expands early release.The short answer was yes, but Mr. Barr bristled at the suggestion he was hostile to the bill. He said he viewed tough-on-crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s, when he was last in office, as responsible for the ensuing drop in violent crime.“I don’t think comparing the policies that were in effect in 1992 to the situation now is really fair,” he told Mr. Grassley. He added, “I think the time was right to take stock and make changes to our penal system based on our current experience.”— Nicholas FandosImageSenator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, questioned Mr. Barr.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times2:44 p.m.Barr draws a distinction between special counsel and other politically charged investigations.Democratic senators wanted other assurances of noninterference, too, particularly for regular federal prosecutors who be separately investigating Mr. Trump or building cases that could be damaging to his interests. Here, Mr. Barr drew a distinction between the special counsel’s investigation, which is governed by special rules, and matters considered through the department’s normal channels.“I have the responsibility to use my judgment and discretion that are inherent in the office of attorney general to supervise,” he said, referring to cases brought through the usual order. To let individual U.S. attorney’s work without supervision or make assurances about individual investigations would be an abdication of that responsibility, he said.Mr. Barr said that he would not stand for efforts to interfere or scuttle investigations within the department for political reasons, but offered a caveat about presidential power.“I would not stand by and allow, you know, an investigation to be stopped if I thought it was a lawful investigation,” he said. “I wouldn’t stand by for that, but the president is free to fire his, you know, officials that he’s appointed.”Democrats had at least one high-profile case in mind. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have built a case that has implicated Mr. Trump in a scheme to pay hush money to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him.“The point is,” Mr. Barr said, “if someone tried to stop a bona fide, lawful investigation to cover up wrongdoing, I would resign.”— Nicholas Fandos1:19 P.M.Barr leaves the open the possibility that he would be willing to allow journalists to be jailed.Asked whether he would consider jailing journalists “for doing their jobs,” Mr. Barr paused before explaining that he could conceive of situations “as a last resort” where a news organization or journalist needs to be held accountable for “putting out stuff that they know will harm the country.”The Justice Department has cracked down in recent years on government employees who share classified information with reporters. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department prosecuted more leaks than all previous administrations combined. Reporters are loathe to reveal sources, and some have been jailed for refusing a judge’s orders to do so.Mr. Barr’s hesitation may have been because of the Justice Department’s long pursuit of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over the site’s publication of troves of secret government papers. Obama-era lawyers debated whether to charge him but held off because they could never decide on a clear answer to the question of how his work differed from that of traditional news organizations.But prosecutors have secretly charged him, they mistakenly revealed last year, raising questions of whether they set aside concerns about setting a precedent that would chill press freedoms because of WikiLeaks’ release of stolen Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives hacked during the 2016 election. — Katie BennerFrom the archivesThen and nowImageMr. Barr during his confirmation hearing for attorney general in 1991.CreditRon Sachs/Consolidated News Pictures, via Getty ImagesImageNearly three decades later, Mr. Barr is once again being considered by the Senate for attorney general.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times1 P.M.Barr supports a border wall as ‘common-sense’ immigration enforcement.Mr. Barr said he agrees with the president about the need to change the nation’s immigration laws, including his demand for a border wall that has prompted the nation’s longest government shutdown.“We need money right now for border security — including barriers and walls and slats and other things,” Mr. Barr said, “anything that makes sense in different areas of the border.”Tuesday marked the 25th day of the partial government shutdown with little indication that Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats were any closer to a compromise on funding for a border wall.Mr. Barr said he would like to see an agreement between lawmakers and the president that recognizes the need for border security, “and part of that common-sense matter needs barriers.”— Eileen SullivanImageMr. Barr is certain to face questions on presidential power.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times11:45 A.M.Barr said he will withstand political pressure. Asked what he would do if confronted with a situation where he might have to resign, Mr. Barr cited his age and his previous stint as attorney general to say he will be unshackled from politics to make the right decision, regardless of whether it is politically prudent for his career or for the president.“It might give me pause if I was 45 or 50 years old, but it doesn’t give me pause right now,” said Mr. Barr, 68.He added: “I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong by anybody whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president. I’m going to do what I think is right.”— Michael S. SchmidtImageSenators Charles E. Grassley, Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein listen to Mr. Barr.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times11:20 A.M.Barr qualified some of his sweeping view of presidential power.Mr. Barr has long advanced an unusually expansive view of executive authority. He has portrayed the president, not the attorney general, as the nation’s top law-enforcement official, and suggested that Congress cannot bar a president from using his executive powers — like to pardon someone or “start or stop a law enforcement proceeding” — in a corrupt way.This has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash Mr. Trump, who is not known for his self-restraint. But in several ways on Tuesday, Mr. Barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings, putting greater emphasis on the Justice Department’s independence and legal limits on the presidency.For example, Mr. Barr said that if a president directed the Justice Department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family, that would violate the Constitution. And asked by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, Mr. Barr said “that would be a crime.”— Charlie Savage10:38 A.M.Barr defended his obstruction of justice memo.ImageMr. Barr faced questions about a memo he wrote in June that was critical of one line of investigation by the special counsel.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesMr. Barr defended as “entirely proper” his decision to write an unsolicited, lengthy memo to the Trump administration legal team in June arguing that Mr. Mueller should not be permitted to investigate the president for violating criminal obstruction-of-justice laws based on how he chose to exercise his constitutional powers, like to fire a subordinate or order an investigation closed.Mr. Barr stressed that he was “in the dark” about what Mr. Mueller’s obstruction theory was, and said that he was merely speculating. He emphasized that his concern was the “ramifications down the road” of establishing such a rule.“One theory in particular that appeared to be under consideration under a specific statute concerned me because I thought it would involve stretching the statute beyond what was intended and would do it in a way that would have serious adverse consequences for all agencies that are involved in the administration of justice, especially the Department of Justice,” he said. “And I thought it would have a chilling effect going forward over time.”— Charlie Savage10:12 A.M.Feinstein: Will you say ‘no’ if Trump tries to use law enforcement for political ends?Ms. Feinstein read excerpts from Mr. Barr’s writings on a president’s purported power to control all law-enforcement activity and said she intended to press him on whether he would resist political interference from Mr. Trump, noting his calls for new criminal inquiries into Democrats like Hillary Clinton.“It’s important that the next attorney general be able to strongly resist pressure, whether from the administration or Congress to conduct investigations for political purposes,” she said. “You must have the integrity, the strength and the fortitude to tell the president ‘no,’ regardless of the consequences.”In his opening statement, Mr. Barr appeared to embrace that principle.“The attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice, the enforcement of the law, is above and away from politics,” he said. “Nothing could be more destructive of our system of government, of the rule of law, or the Department of Justice as an institution than any toleration of political interference with the enforcement of the law.”— Charlie Savage10:02 A.M.‘Somebody needs to make money in the family.’ImageMr. Barr introduced members of his family during his opening statement. He noted most of his children are government lawyers.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesMr. Barr briefly spoke of his commitment to public service and the Justice Department. He noted that most of his children are government lawyers, including one in a top position at the Justice Department. One of his three daughters coordinates the department’s response to the opioid crisis, and a son-in-law also works in the department’s national security division.“Somebody needs to make money in the family,” joked Mr. Graham.— Katie BennerEven with a divided Senate, Barr’s confirmation odds look good.When Mr. Barr was nominated to serve as attorney general the first time in 1991, the Democratic Senate unanimously confirmed him by voice vote. He should not expect such a smooth ride this time around, but with Republicans in control of the chamber by a 53-to-47 majority, his confirmation appears to be on track.Two wild cards could scramble the usual partisan divide. A handful of moderate Republicans facing re-election fights in 2020 or simply skeptical of Mr. Trump’s intentions could theoretically swing against Mr. Barr if he fails to convince them that he would stand up for the special counsel. If these senators — Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah and others — banded together with a united Democratic caucus, they could kill the confirmation.But Democrats may also be motivated to quickly move Mr. Barr through confirmation. They have been highly critical of the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist whom they view as a direct threat to Mr. Mueller, and want him out of office as quickly as possible. If they view Mr. Barr as sincere in his public assurances about the investigation, it is a swap many Democrats might eagerly make.— Nicholas FandosTrump Says He Alone Can Do It.

Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, issued a warning after President Trump spoke about his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos and Maggie HabermanJan. 13, 2019WASHINGTON — Three newly empowered Democratic House committee chairmen, alarmed by statements over the weekend by President Trump about his former lawyer’s planned testimony before Congress, cautioned on Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness’s testimony could be construed as a crime.The warning, a stark and unusual message from some of Congress’s most influential Democrats, underscores the increasing legal and political peril facing Mr. Trump. Democrats are beginning their own investigations of him as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, appears to move toward a conclusion in his investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump.In a Fox News interview on Saturday night, Mr. Trump accused the former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, of lying about him to win leniency from federal prosecutors and spoke cryptically of the existence of damaging information against Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law. Mr. Cohen, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, has accused Mr. Trump of directing him to make illegal hush payments during the campaign.“Our nation’s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress,” the chairmen wrote. “The president should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress’s independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress.”The message seemed to imply that if Democrats in the House were to ever try to build an impeachment case against Mr. Trump, attempts to interfere with their work could be used as evidence.One of the chairmen who signed the letter, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the Oversight and Reform Committee, announced last week that Mr. Cohen would testify publicly for the first time next month about his work on behalf of Mr. Trump. The hearing promises to be a blockbuster session that could further erode Mr. Trump’s public image and clarify the extent of his legal exposure.In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. He later pleaded guilty
to an additional charge of lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016. He acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s associates pursued the project well into 2016, as the Kremlin was escalating its efforts to interfere in the American election on his behalf.In court, he said Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him. He worked closely alongside Mr. Trump during his time as a businessman and candidate, and has spent more than 70 hours with federal prosecutors in Manhattan as well as with Mr. Mueller’s team.As Mr. Trump’s attacks on him have intensified, Mr. Cohen has told friends that he is worried for his safety, though no public evidence of any such threats has emerged.Mr. Trump’s comments about Mr. Cohen on Saturday, made during a friendly interview with Jeanine Pirro of Fox News, were his first extended remarks on the matter since Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony was announced. Asked by Ms. Pirro if he was “worried” about the testimony, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen “weak” and asserted — in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in Manhattan — that Mr. Cohen had “no information” on him.“He’s in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that I know nothing about,” Mr. Trump said. “And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I’ll tell — I’ll give you some information on the president.”Mr. Trump then implied that Mr. Cohen ought to be sharing information instead on his father-in-law, whose name he said he did not know.“But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that’s the one that people want to look at,” he said, adding, “That’s the money in the family.” Pressed by Ms. Pirro for more details, Mr. Trump said, “I don’t know, but you’ll find out, and you’ll look into it because nobody knows what’s going on over there.”Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. The year before his daughter’s marriage to Mr. Cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. He was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.Saturday was not the first time Mr. Trump has targeted Mr. Cohen’s family. After Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said Mr. Cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.As they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to Mr. Cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. That threat helped push Mr. Cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.Prosecutors have made no move toward his wife since Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea in August.The statement from the three chairmen was also signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman. Both men are investigating the president for various reasons, and Mr. Nadler’s committee would be the body to weigh a possible impeachment.Mr. Nadler has said he will wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his work before seriously considering impeachment, but he told The New York Times last month that the campaign finance fraud laid out by prosecutors in New York was likely to meet the criteria for an impeachable offense and warranted congressional investigation.He has also issued repeated warnings about Mr. Trump’s attacks on federal law enforcement officials, including Mr. Mueller.In 1974, the Judiciary Committee included obstruction of congressional investigations and proceedings among a litany of offenses for which it voted to impeach President Richard M. Nixon. He resigned from office before the full House voted on the impeachment articles.Correction: Jan. 14, 2019A previous version of this article misstated Mr. Cohen’s business relationship with his father-in-law.

Barr has long espoused an unfettered vision of executive power. He may soon serve a president not known for self-restraint.ImageWilliam P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, has long maintained an expansive view of executive power.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageJan. 14, 2019WASHINGTON — The meeting of President George Bush’s cabinet on Jan. 8, 1991, was even more high-stakes than usual. Iraq had invaded Kuwait. Half a million American troops were deployed and ready to attack. But many lawmakers were demanding a vote before any war.Rejecting mainstream constitutional views, William P. Barr, the deputy attorney general, told Mr. Bush that he wielded unfettered power to start a major land war on his own — not only without congressional permission, but even if Congress voted against it.“Mr. President, there’s no doubt that you have the authority to launch an attack,” Mr. Barr said, as he later recalled.Ultimately, Mr. Bush was cautious about invoking that maximalist theory of executive power and asked lawmakers for support anyway — a prudent step that Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Bush soon elevated to attorney general, also recommended. Congress’s vote ensured the Persian Gulf war was lawful.Nearly three decades later, President Trump has nominated Mr. Barr to return as attorney general. But unlike the self-restrained Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump revels in pushing limits — a temperament that, when combined with Mr. Barr’s unusually permissive understanding of presidential power, could play out very differently for the rule of law than it did last time.“There are concerns about his independence, given his longstanding and expansive views of executive power,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, which will hold Mr. Barr’s confirmation hearing starting Tuesday. “So the question is, Is he right for this time, and can he really be independent of this president and the White House?”ImageMr. Barr, then the attorney general, and President George Bush in the Oval Office in 1992.CreditBarry Thumma/Associated PressMr. Trump ousted his administration’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, in November, after long excoriating him for having followed ethics officials’ advice that he recuse himself from overseeing what became the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump said that he needed an attorney general who would protect him and that he would not have appointed Mr. Sessions if he had known he would recuse himself. The two-day hearing for Mr. Barr, 68, will play out against the backdrop of swelling rule-of-law turmoil, from Mr. Trump’s pressuring the Justice Department to curtail investigations into his associates and to open them into his opponents to his threat to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress on border-wall funds, to coming oversight fights with House Democrats.Democrats have demanded that Mr. Barr protect Mr. Mueller as he completes the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry on behalf of Moscow. Democrats have also focused on whether Mr. Barr would turn over to Congress any report Mr. Mueller compiles.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the new Judiciary Committee chairman, told reporters after meeting with Mr. Barr last week that the nominee had said he saw no reason to fire Mr. Mueller and had pledged to “err on the side of transparency” about any report. But neither statement addressed what he would do if Mr. Trump ordered him to act otherwise.Mr. Barr is likely to be confirmed because Republicans control the Senate and because defeating him would leave in place the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist whose installation in that role Democrats see as illegitimate and a threat to Mr. Mueller. Ethics officials advised Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself from the Russia case, but he refused.But Mr. Barr has already drawn scrutiny over the revelation last month that he sent an apparently unsolicited 19-page memo to the Trump legal team in June arguing that Mr. Mueller should not be permitted to investigate Mr. Trump for criminal obstruction of justice.Mr. Barr’s argument derived from his broad view of executive power: The Constitution, he claimed, does not permit Congress to make it a crime for the president to exercise his executive powers corruptly — even if he were to fire a subordinate, pardon someone or use what Mr. Barr termed his “complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding” to cover up crimes by himself or his associates.The claim that the framers of the Constitution empowered presidents to impede investigations for corrupt ends goes too far, many legal scholars say. But Supreme Court precedents offer few definitive guideposts, giving the attorney general broad latitude.“The interpretive approach of Justice Department lawyers to the Constitution is very important because many separation-of-powers issues never wind up in court,” said Peter Shane, an Ohio State University law professor. “Barr’s method is not uniquely his, but it does represent a particularly aggressive school of executive power thought.”Mr. Barr started his career as a C.I.A. analyst before becoming an agency legislative affairs official in the mid-1970s, during the post-Watergate and post-Vietnam War era when a congressional investigation dragged decades of intelligence abuses into the light over the executive branch’s objections.After going to law school, he joined the Reagan White House and worked on domestic policy with C. Boyden Gray, the counsel to then-Vice President George Bush. At the time, the administration was battling Democrats in Congress over its push for deregulation. The conflicts helped spur the Reagan legal team to develop new executive power theories that would diminish the influence of Congress.Their legal policy innovations intensified in Mr. Reagan’s second term, after Mr. Barr had returned to private practice and senior administration officials were caught steering aid to anti-Marxist militants in Nicaragua despite a law forbidding such assistance. The scandal, known as Iran-contra, set off investigations by Congress and an independent counsel.Amid the fallout, the Reagan legal team called into question the legitimacy of both the law barring aid and one allowing for prosecutors the president could not fire. The president’s lawyers saw them as congressional encroachments on the president’s rightful powers, though the Supreme Court upheld the independent counsel law in 1988.The next year, when Mr. Barr returned to public service in the new Bush administration, he took up the executive power mission as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, the powerful agency within the Justice Department that evaluates the legality of proposed executive branch actions. Mr. Gray, who had become White House counsel under Mr. Bush, “was intent on getting someone in that position who believed in executive authority,” Mr. Barr later recalled.ImageA Marine patrol near Kuwait City in 1991. Mr. Barr argued that Mr. Bush could unilaterally launch the gulf war without Congress, though he advised the president to seek lawmakers' approval. Mr. Bush eventually did.CreditJohn Gaps III/Associated PressNormally, the Office of Legal Counsel waits to be asked a specific legal question about a particular dispute before weighing in. But among his first major acts was to write an apparently unsolicited 10-page memo to top lawyers across the executive branch, urging vigilance against any attempts by Congress to limit presidential power.“Only by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursions can executive branch prerogatives be preserved,” he wrote.Mr. Barr denounced lawmakers’ pursuit of sensitive administration information for oversight investigations and the creation of legal limits on the president’s power to fire certain officials in order to give them a degree of independence. “The power to remove is the power to control,” he wrote.As Mr. Bush’s term progressed, Mr. Barr not only argued that the president could unilaterally launch the gulf war without Congress — echoing a move by President Harry S. Truman, to enduring legal controversy, in the Korean War four decades earlier — but also sought to push the boundaries of presidential flexibility in many other ways, large and small.In 1990, for example, Mr. Barr asserted that the Bush administration could lawfully choose to disregard a law in which Congress, as a condition of funding a diplomatic delegation, required that a representative from a congressional panel be included. Arguing that Congress had no authority in the area of foreign affairs, he asserted that it was therefore “self-evidently” true that lawmakers could not enact a law influencing the president’s choices of diplomatic agents.That same year, he argued more broadly in a panel discussion that even with the power of the purse, lawmakers lack the authority to influence policy by placing conditions on appropriations for government activities that fall under the president’s executive powers. Ultimately, Congress only has the power to provide a “lump sum” to the president in those cases, he said.ImageA portion of a memo written by Mr. Barr.After Mr. Bush lost the 1992 election and before he left office, he pardoned half a dozen officials caught up in the Iran-contra affair just before one, Caspar Weinberger, was about to go to trial. Foreshadowing the controversy over Mr. Trump’s dangling of potential pardons in the Russia investigation, the prosecutor accused Mr. Bush of a cover-up that could have implicated his own conduct. Mr. Barr later said that he had personally urged Mr. Bush to pardon the officials because he thought they had been “unjustly treated.”In the years after the Bush administration ended, Mr. Barr became a top lawyer for the telecommunications company that evolved into Verizon, working mainly on business and regulatory issues. But he also continued to play a role in legal policy debates over executive power and national security, especially after the Sept. 11 attacks.After Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act to loosen restrictions on government surveillance that grew out of the 1970s oversight investigations, he testified that the new statute had been a good first step but did not go far enough.In 2005, after the George W. Bush administration’s detainee abuses started coming to light, he defended Mr. Bush’s power to declare that prisoners in the war on terror were not protected by the Geneva Conventions and so could be lawfully subjected to coercive questioning.ImageMr. Barr suggested that the Bush administration prosecute the Sept. 11 attacks through a military commissions system.CreditAndres Leighton/Associated Press“Generally, under the laws of war, absent treaty, there is nothing wrong with coercive interrogation, applying pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk,” he said, pausing, then adding, “as long as it doesn’t cross the line and involve the gratuitous barbarity that’s involved in torture.”Later that year, Congress tightened laws against treating detainees in cruel or degrading ways, but Mr. Bush claimed he had constitutional power to do so anyway. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the Geneva Conventions did require humane treatment of terrorism detainees, contrary to the Bush legal team theories that Mr. Barr had echoed.Mr. Barr also repeatedly defended Mr. Bush’s decision to create the ill-fated system of military commissions instead of civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects. In fact, it was Mr. Barr who privately suggested to the Bush White House that it create a tribunals system, an idea he had considered as attorney general during the investigation of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Two Libyan suspects were indicted in civilian court in 1991.Mr. Barr has recounted a story about that case that may resonate with Democrats’ expressed concerns about whether he will maintain Justice Department independence against political interference by Mr. Trump. When prosecutors were preparing to indict the Pan Am 103 suspects, Mr. Bush cautiously asked his attorney general “would it be O.K.” to brief the National Security Council on the situation. Taken aback at Mr. Bush’s hands-off attitude, Mr. Barr made clear that he saw the president as excessively deferential — and invoked the notion, popular among executive power maximalists, that the president, not the attorney general, is the prosecutor in chief.“Would it be O.K.? Well, I work for you; you’re the top law enforcement officer. Of course it’s O.K.,” Mr. Barr recalled marveling. “The attitude was, You have to be very careful with pending matters of justice.”A Memo and a Recusal Decision Underscore Potential Threats to the Mueller InquiryDec. 20, 2018Trump Will Nominate William Barr as Attorney GeneralDec. 7, 2018Charlie Savage is a Washington-based national security and legal policy correspondent.

VogelJan. 16, 2019ImageThe Treasury Department has moved to ease sanctions against the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska’s companies.CreditCreditSergei Karpukhin/ReutersWASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Wednesday narrowly staved off an effort by Democrats to deal the Trump administration’s Russia sanctions policy an embarrassing rebuke.Eleven Republicans joined Democrats in a vote to enforce sanctions against the corporate empire of an influential ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but the effort fell three votes short of the 60-vote threshold required to advance the measure. The vote was 57-42, with one Democratic senator not voting.The sanctions against companies controlled by the influential oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, now seem destined to be lifted this week as part of a deal negotiated by the Treasury Department to reduce Mr. Deripaska’s ownership and control of the aluminum giant Rusal and two linked companies.Sanctions against Mr. Deripaska personally, which had gone into effect last April, remain in force and would not have been affected by the Treasury Department decision or the Senate measure. Mr. Deripaska’s companies waged an aggressive lobbying and legal campaign against the sanctions last year. The administration first delayed putting sanctions on the companies into effect and then announced last month it would lift them entirely.The Republicans who voted against the administration plan were adhering to what had once been party orthodoxy: taking a hard line against Moscow. The Republicans who voted in favor of lifting the sanctions did so at a time when President Trump’s warmer stance toward Russia has inflamed questions about the Kremlin’s efforts to help elect him.ImageSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, had worked to derail the congressional measure.CreditYuri Gripas/ReutersDemocrats had argued that the deal announced last month between the Treasury Department and Mr. Deripaska’s companies amounted to letting Russia off easy at a moment when serious questions remained about the relationship between Mr. Trump, his team and Russia.Democrats had urged the administration to delay its decision on the fate of the sanctions until the conclusion of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling on behalf of Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, and whether Mr. Trump’s team assisted the Russians. Mr. Deripaska has emerged as a bit character in the story lines around the investigation as a result of his relationship with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, who has been convicted and pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team.The sanctions were announced by the Treasury Department last April on Mr. Deripaska, his companies and those of other Russian oligarchs in retaliation for the Russian meddling in the presidential election. The announcement was heralded as evidence that the administration was taking a tough stance against Moscow.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had argued that the deal to lift the sanctions penalized Mr. Deripaska personally, while avoiding unintended economic ripple effects that could damage companies in the United States, Europe, Jamaica, Guinea and elsewhere by disrupting the supply of aluminum.Mr. Mnuchin had defended the deal in meetings with lawmakers, and Mr. McConnell on the floor of the Senate accused Democrats of politicizing the sanctions on Tuesday.Eleven Republican senators voted with Democrats on a procedural vote on Tuesday to advance the measure, which cleared a 51-vote threshold, setting up Wednesday’s vote, which required 60 votes to keep the legislation alive. The same Republicans supported the measure again on Wednesday.The Republican senators who voted with Democrats were John Boozman of Arkansas; Susan Collins of Maine; Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Steve Daines of Montana; Cory Gardner of Colorado; Josh Hawley of Missouri; John Kennedy of Louisiana; Martha McSally of Arizona; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Marco Rubio of Florida; and Ben Sasse of Nebraska.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Democrats Fall Short in Sanctions Vote.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Donald Trump: The Russia FileAdvertisementOpinionSupported byDonald Trump: The Russia FileAmericans deserve to know what the president and Vladimir Putin are talking about.By The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Jan. 14, 2019ImageCreditCreditGiulia SagramolaIf, beleaguered or bemused by the onrush of scandal and political antics, you’re searching for some index of just how truly not-normal American governance has become, you might consider this: Standing on the White House lawn on Monday morning, his own government shut down around him, the president of the United States was asked by reporters if he was working for Russia.He said that he was not. “Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question, because it's a whole big fat hoax,” President Trump said. Yet the reporters were right to ask, given Mr. Trump’s bizarre pattern of behavior toward a Russian regime that the Republican Party quite recently regarded as America’s chief rival. Indeed, it’s unnerving that more people — particularly in the leadership of the Republican Party — aren’t alarmed by Mr. Trump’s secretive communications with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and reliance on his word over the conclusions of American intelligence agencies.The Times reported last week that the F.B.I. started a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump in 2017 after he fired James Comey, the bureau’s director, to determine whether Russia had influenced him. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that the president has concealed details about his meetings with Mr. Putin even from officials of his own administration — going so far, on at least one occasion, as to confiscate his interpreter's notes.These revelations joined a long list of suspicious incidents and connections between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.The Russian government interfered in the 2016 election in order to get Mr. Trump elected, of course. America’s intelligence community agrees on that. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is examining what happened before and after Election Day between the campaign and Mr. Putin’s government. But Mr. Trump’s behavior simply since he’s been in office hasn’t given any peace of mind even to those willing to give him the benefit of the doubt — at least, those outside the Republican leadership.In the past month, the president announced that American troops would pull out of the conflict in Syria, something that the Russians have long called for. Mr. Trump subsequently said the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan in 1979, parroting Russian revisionist history by claiming it was seeking to quell terrorism. This month, it was revealed that federal prosecutors had accused Mr. Trump’s former campaign chief Paul Manafort of sharing political polling data in 2016 with an associate linked to Russian intelligence, the most direct evidence to date that the campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russia.Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is pushing to end sanctions against companies owned by Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch closely tied to Mr. Putin. Those sanctions were put in place in 2018 in retaliation for Russian meddling with the election.Despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that he has been “much tougher on Russia” than previous presidents, he sure has a strange way of showing it. Throughout his time in the White House Mr. Trump has praised leaders aligned with Mr. Putin, like Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary. He has praised Mr. Putin outright. At the same time, the president has fired broadside after broadside at the twin pillars of stability in Western Europe: the European Union and NATO. He reportedly suggested that France leave the bloc and repeatedly called into question whether the United States would stand by its commitments to the military alliance. Weakening Western unity, as evidenced by those organizations, has long animated Russian foreign policy.Some of these moves are consistent with Mr. Trump’s isolationism and pronounced yen for authoritarians, and perhaps also with his demonstrated ignorance of history.It’s harder to come up with a rational excuse for Mr. Trump’s secrecy about his dealings with Mr. Putin, or for why, in 2017, he shared highly classified information from Israel with the Russian foreign minister in a meeting in the Oval Office while also boasting about relieving heat from the investigation into his possible Russia ties by firing the F.B.I. director. Mr. Trump has also sided with Mr. Putin and against the conclusions of American intelligence agencies by denying that the Russian government tampered with the election.While Mr. Trump has plenty of kind words for a foreign leader who doesn’t have America’s best interests at heart, he seems to be willing to heap no end of abuse on his fellow Americans, particularly those in the F.B.I. and the Justice Department who have sworn to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.On Monday, Mr. Trump lashed out at F.B.I. agents for opening the counterintelligence investigation against him, calling them “known scoundrels.”With the House of Representatives newly under Democratic control, Mr. Trump might finally receive meaningful oversight that could help either uncover wrongdoing or put Americans’ minds at ease about their president.On Sunday, the new Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, urged his Republican colleagues to back his effort to obtain notes or testimony from the interpreter present at the meetings between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. “Shouldn’t we find out whether our president is really putting ‘America first?’” Mr. Schiff tweeted. This is not a new or unexplored possibility, even among Republicans at one time. “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” Kevin McCarthy, who was then House majority leader, told his fellow Republicans at a closed-door meeting, The Washington Post first reported, shortly before Mr. Trump won his party’s nomination for the White House in 2016. Dana Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman from California who lost his bid for re-election in November, was such a staunch supporter of Moscow on Capitol Hill that the F.B.I. concluded that Russian spies were trying to recruit him. Mr. McCarthy said later that his line about Mr. Trump being paid by Moscow was a quip that landed flat. What’s no laughing matter is the unwillingness of the Republican Party to cast a critical eye upon a sitting president who has so flouted accepted practice for dealing with any foreign leader — not to mention one as adversarial as Vladimir Putin.

Sign up for our newsletter, Watching.]With the partial government shutdown continuing to stretch on, “Saturday Night Live” proposed its own solution to the standoff: a game show parody.The first new “S.N.L.” of 2019 opened with a special “government shutdown edition” of “Deal or No Deal,” whose only contestant was President Trump — played by Alec Baldwin in his recurring role — looking for a compromise that would end the impasse.As the host Steve Harvey (played by Kenan Thompson) explained to Baldwin, “Earlier today you went on TV and you told the American people that you wanted to make a deal.” He added, “So we decided to do this in the only format that you can understand: a TV game show with women holding briefcases.”After rejecting the immigration deal that Congress offered in December, Baldwin made a counterproposal: “I want $5 billion for my border wall,” he said, “and in exchange I’ll extend DACA, and I’ll release the kids from cages so they can be free-range kids.”Baldwin considered other offers contained in briefcases held by various members of Congress. He started with Nancy Pelosi (Kate McKinnon), whose briefcase contained a note that read, “$1 billion + you say ‘Nancy’s my mommy.’”As Baldwin and McKinnon bickered further, Thompson said, “This is like watching two grandparents fight over the thermostat.”Baldwin next turned to Chuck Schumer (Alex Moffat), who opened a briefcase that said, “Whatever you want.”McKinnon reminded him: “Chuck, we’re not doing that anymore. Remember, we’re projecting strength?” she said. Moffat turned over another card that read, “$15 + Pastrami on Rye.”Baldwin further approached Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett), Maxine Waters (Leslie Jones) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villaseñor), who quipped, “Trump and the G.O.P are just terrified of me because I’m under 100 and I know how to use Instagram.”Finally, Baldwin turned to a Clemson football player (Pete Davidson) who wasn’t holding a briefcase but instead carried a White Castle box with a note inside that read, “Hamberders.”Baldwin settled his dispute for a hamburger, and Thompson observed, “Well, I guess that makes as much sense as anything else that’s going on these days.”In other memorable moments from the show:Return of Pete Davidson of the WeekHours before the last “S.N.L.” episode of 2018, Pete Davidson published a troubling Instagram message in which he wrote, in part, “I don’t really want to be on this earth anymore. I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last.” (The New York Police Department subsequently sent an officer to NBC to check on Davidson, who has talked about being given a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.)This week, Davidson appeared in several sketches as well as this “Weekend Update” deskside segment where, at first, it appeared he was going to address last month’s worrisome events. “As you know,” Davidson said, “I’ve had a really crazy month, and I want to talk about something that really matters to me.”Colin Jost asked, “Mental health?”Davidson answered, “No, the new Clint Eastwood movie ‘The Mule.’”Davidson then brought out John Mulaney, the comedian and “S.N.L.” alumnus, and the two of them then really did make a lot of jokes about “The Mule.”But at one point in the bit, Mulaney said, “I’ve been spending time with Pete, to try to show him that you can have a life in comedy that is not insane; a sober domestic life.”Davidson replied, “Yeah, and after observing John’s life, I publicly threatened suicide.”After a few laughs, Mulaney turned to Davidson and said, “You are loved by many. And we are glad you are O.K.”“Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Parody of the WeekYou can’t have an “S.N.L.” episode hosted by Rachel Brosnahan without poking a little fun at her hit Amazon series, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” In this take on the show, Leslie Jones plays Rita Mae Johnson, a floor-sweeper at the Gaslight Café who, with a little encouragement from Mrs. Maisel, becomes an exceptionally foul-mouthed stand-up comic named “The Raunchiest Miss Rita.”We can’t reproduce any of her jokes here, but we will endorse this sketch’s impersonations of the “Mrs. Maisel” co-stars Alex Borstein (Aidy Bryant) and Tony Shalhoub (Kyle Mooney).Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the shutdown and a BuzzFeed News report that was disputed by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Jost:President Trump, the man who said he would own the shutdown, clearly does not care about the people who are working unpaid, who can’t afford basic things like food. But why would he care? He’s a billionaire who controls all the hamburgers in the world. Then after Scrooge McDonald’s was done hosting his burger orgy, he went on television today and made a new proposal to end the shutdown. And that proposal was basically, “You give me $5.7 billion and I’ll give you back the Dreamers.”Am I the only one who thinks that sounds like a hostage negotiation? I can’t wait to see his written proposal. [A ransom note appears on screen.] By the way, these protections he’s offering aren’t even real laws, they’re just vague promises he’s making. And I trust a promise from Donald Trump as much as I trust R. Kelly in a Claire’s boutique.Che:Yeah, I agree. That speech sucked. First of all, he didn’t even say hi. He just started talking, like we was already talking. I found that to be rude. Then he said he’s going to stop half the crime and 90 percent of the heroin with something called slats. Which as you can see is a wall without all the wall. Hear that, Mexico? Good luck trying to crack this code. What are you going to do, pass your drugs and small children through those giant slats? Imagine you’re a Coast Guard or TSA or any of the thousands of government workers that are actually stopping drugs and crime from getting into this country, and you haven’t been paid in a month. And the president gets on TV — doesn’t say sorry, doesn’t even say hi — but instead, he’s like, “Hey, what do you all think about slats?”Jost:BuzzFeed published a story that said Robert Mueller had evidence of Trump committing an impeachable crime. But the details were so sketchy that even Mueller’s team had to be like, “Sorry, fake news.” How disappointing was that? You know how many suburban moms had to retract their group texts to the family reading, “We got him!!!” The crazy part is that the White House is now celebrating that Mueller disputed only this one aspect of the investigation, while there’s still like 100 other crimes still on the table. If you got tested for every STD, and your doctor said, “Well, the good news is, you don’t have chlamydia,” you wouldn’t be like, “That’s all I need to hear, doc — no condoms for this guy.”Che:Look, BuzzFeed, I think it’s great — we all think it’s great that you all want to help. But this isn’t really what we need from you. Y’all are BuzzFeed, you do memes and lists. Everybody’s got that aunt who has roaches, and every Thanksgiving, she’s like, “Hey, y’all, what should I bring?” And we’re like, “Uh, ice. You bring the ice, because we don’t want to be picking raisins out of the turkey.” That’s you, BuzzFeed, you bring the Ice. As Dr. King once said, “Don’t go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you’re used to.” There’s no shame in that. We all play a role. Look, sometimes, kids come up to me and they’ll say, “Michael Che, I get all my news from you.” And I say, “Don’t do that.” I bring the ice.Weekend Update Deskside Bit of the WeekPlaying Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts and 2020 presidential hopeful, Kate McKinnon sought to establish herself as a fighter: “I’m like if ‘Monday Night Raw’ was hosted by Terry Gross,” she said. McKinnon also took potshots at potential Democratic rivals like Kirsten Gillibrand (whom she called “Kirsten Stole-My-Brand”) and rued her decision to take a DNA test to prove that her family had origins in the Cherokee and Delaware tribes:“I did the DNA test,” she said, “and the test came back 100 percent bad idea. Who knew race science wasn’t a good PR strategy?”Fake Commercial of the WeekIf you’ve kept up with the conversation around a recent Gillette advertisement that asks consumers to give more thought to patterns of toxic male behavior and turns the razor company’s slogan into a moral question — “Is this the best a man can get?” — you’ll have the proper context for this “S.N.L.” parody: a fake commercial for Kool-Aid, in which men engage in toxic conduct — say, bursting into a business meeting and interrupting a female colleague — while under the influence of the popular flavored drink. As a solemn voice-over reminds viewers, “The Kool-Aid boys watching today will be the Kool-Aid men of tomorrow.”Related Coverage‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ Is Back, and Stephanie Beatriz Is Making the Most of ItJan. 18, 2019Image‘Schitt’s Creek’ Brings Love, Canadian StyleJan. 15, 2019Image‘S.N.L.’: Pete Davidson Largely Absent From Last Show of YearDec. 16, 2018ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsF.B.I., Shutdown, Syria, Jayme Closs: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times

Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.ImageCreditAl Drago/The New York Times1. The F.B.I. opened an inquiry into whether President Trump was secretly working with Russia after he fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.The inquiry carried explosive implications. Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security.The special counsel, Robert Mueller, took over the inquiry when he was appointed days after F.B.I. officials opened it. The investigation also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.The inquiry into Mr. Trump is part of Mr. Mueller’s broader examination of how Russia interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter.No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials.ImageCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times2. At midnight, the partial government shutdown became the longest in American history.Our White House correspondents analyzed the mood in Washington.Officially, Republicans blame Democrats. Privately, many concede, the stalemate over President Trump’s demand for a border wall has been made exponentially worse by how the White House played its cards on Capitol Hill, where two years of contradictory statements and actions have built up a profound lack of trust.“It’s always difficult when the person you’re negotiating with changes their mind — including my wife,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas._____ImageCreditMichael B. Thomas for The New York Times3. The shutdown is being felt by Americans in widely varying ways, hitting some hard and missing others completely.“It has been terrible,” said Andrea Caviedes, a single mother who is furloughed from the Agriculture Department. “My rent bill is due, my electric bill is due, my water bill is due, and I have medical expenses.” Ms. Caviedes, above right, serves on her church’s stage production team in her spare time.To her friend Ximena Gumpel, it’s a blip on the nightly news: “You kind of push it aside and figure it will pass, that it’s just political bickering,” she said.The partial shutdown is starting to affect air travel as a growing number of security agents are refusing to work for no pay. Another industry being held hostage by the shutdown: craft brewing._____ImageCreditDelil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images4. The U.S. began withdrawing equipment from Syria — but no troops yet — as part of President Trump’s order to wind down military operations there.Officials said the number of American troops might actually increase in Syria, to help protect the final withdrawal — an operation that is still expected to take at least four to six months. Above, a convoy of U.S. military vehicles in Syria in December.As recently as Sunday, the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, said the pullout was conditional. Then early Friday, a vaguely worded statement from the American military headquarters in Baghdad said the withdrawal process had begun.The surprise announcement came amid continuing confusion over plans to disengage from one of the Middle East’s most complex conflicts._____ImageCreditSakchai Lalit/Associated Press5. An 18-year-old woman who fled Saudi Arabia fearing for her life has been granted asylum in Canada, officials said.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, above right, had rallied support from an airport hotel room in Thailand to avoid being deported, saying she feared that her relatives might kill her.The phenomenon of women trying to flee Saudi Arabia is not new. But the number of young women considering and taking the enormous risk appears to have grown in recent years, rights groups say, as women frustrated by social and legal constraints at home turn to social media to help plan, and sometimes document, their efforts to escape.In Saudi Arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. “It is male guardianship that made us flee from Saudi Arabia,” said one woman who ran away as a teenager. “That is the biggest reason that the girls flee.”_____ImageCreditEric Gaillard/Reuters6. Poland has arrested two telecommunications executives, including a Chinese employee of Huawei, and charged them with spying for Beijing.The arrest of the Huawei employee is almost certain to escalate tensions between Western countries and China over the company, which the authorities in the United States have accused of acting as an arm of the Chinese government and making equipment designed for spying.In December, the daughter of Huawei’s founder was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S. It was unclear whether the arrests in Poland had been requested by the U.S., but a senior Western diplomat said the Justice Department had been working with the Polish government.Huawei has long denied spying for the Chinese government._____ImageCreditBarron County Sheriff's Department, via Associated Press7.

Inquiry Into Trump and Russia“The American people need to know whether their president is a Russian asset,” says a reader. Jan. 14, 2019Image CreditCreditJuan Mabromata/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesTo the Editor:Re “F.B.I. Investigated if Trump Worked for the Russians” (front page, Jan. 12):The F.B.I. had enough evidence to open up a counterintelligence investigation of the president of the United States. This is a mind-boggling pronouncement. That the investigators considered the president a possible “threat to national security” is in and of itself a startling proposition. We should all take stock of the state of our nation. The American people need to know whether their president is a Russian asset. We need to know that our nation is secure. We need to know if the president, whether wittingly or unwittingly, is acting against American interests and in the national interests of Russia. Did he conspire with a foreign entity to manipulate our electorate?We need answers, and we need them now. Our nation is in peril, and we cannot wait patiently for investigations to play out. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to assuage our fears, or confirm them, by giving us a clear conclusion to his investigations in the very near future. Ellen Silverman PopperWhitestone, QueensTo the Editor:Why are people surprised that the F.B.I. investigated whether President Trump was working for the Russians? Of course the agency would be suspicious, and it is its job to investigate when suspicious.From my perspective, as someone who knows about spies and counterintelligence only from newspapers, books, movies and TV, Mr. Trump has been doing everything that Vladimir Putin would want him to do, right from the start. The list is too long for this letter, but it has been obvious — everything from asking the Russians to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails, to firing James Comey, to picking fights with our allies, to private meetings with Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump is the Manchurian candidate for real. And the next question is, why has Senator Mitch McConnell let him get away with this? Elly SidelNorwalk, Conn.To the Editor:Every meeting attended by the president should be recorded digitally and by a transcriptionist. This should not be an option to be accepted or rejected at will by a potentially duplicitous individual. This way we would have a record of a commander in chief calling certain countries, well, you know what, or making promises to foreign countries to suspend sanctions imposed by Congress.There would be no dispute. And no doubt about who slipped classified information to Russian visitors in the Oval Office. And never again would questions arise about an international summit without an accurate American interpreter and recording of the discussion. Let’s see this new Congress put some teeth into some real security measures that will protect our country and bring truth to the table.Janet Mines KringsJersey CityA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: The F.B.I.

Blockbuster findings? Don’t expect them anytime soon.ImageRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, plans to narrow the panel’s Russia investigation.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Nicholas FandosJan. 9, 2019WASHINGTON — Democrats, transitioning into the House majority, have quietly sent dozens of letters in recent weeks seeking documents and testimony from President Trump’s businesses, his campaign and his administration, setting the table for investigations that could reach the center of his presidency.Clear targets have emerged in the process, and some others appear to have fallen away, at least for now. Family separation and detention policies at the border have jumped to the forefront. So has the acting attorney general’s oversight of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But Democrats, after slamming House Republicans for their inadequate inquiry, do not plan to reopen a full-scale Russian interference investigation. They have also chosen to hold off on an immediate request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns.For eager liberals coming off two years of Republican oversight paralysis, the next few weeks may feel something like a game of hurry up and wait. Arranging witnesses and wrangling sensitive government documents take time, and most House committees have yet to be populated with lawmakers, not to mention much of the legion of lawyers who will do a lot of the work of investigations. The Intelligence Committee did not technically have a chairman until last week.“Those people who are expecting some kind of Hollywood movie here are going to be disappointed because it is going be very orderly,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee.Here is what Democrats will focus on first.Immigration policy and the special counsel’s investigations.ImageUndocumented immigrant families were dropped off in July at a bus station in McAllen, Tex., after being released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesThe impasse over Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall and the death late last month of an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala in United States custody have catapulted the administration’s divisive policies at the border to the top of House Democrats’ agenda. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, and a handful of other chairmen plan to examine immigration policies.Their interest and detailed questions could prove problematic for Mr. Trump’s efforts to make a case for his border wall, shining a light on gaps in the current policy and trying to highlight the human toll on migrants.“We are calling on D.H.S. to preserve any and all evidence related to these horrible incidents,” the chairmen wrote. “We as a country can and must do better.”Mr. Nadler has already invited Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to be the committee’s first public hearing witness, and indicated on Wednesday that he would subpoena Mr. Whitaker if necessary to compel an appearance before the end of the month. Democrats are intent on pressing Mr. Whitaker on his involvement in the ousting of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his role in the oversight of the special counsel investigation and other policy matters, including the administration’s decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general.Mr. Nadler has indicated that he intends to wait for Mr. Mueller to conclude his work before seriously considering an impeachment inquiry — a prospect weighing heavily on Democrats that could swamp other oversight efforts. But he said in December that the committee would begin investigating facts presented by federal prosecutors that strongly point to Mr. Trump’s involvement in hush-money payments just before the 2016 election to two women who claim to have had affairs with him, a violation of campaign finance law. They will also look at what Democrats view as “improper” communications between the president and federal law enforcement.On Russia, targeted questions rather than a full inquiry.ImageThe House Intelligence Committee plans to investigate meetings held at Trump Tower in Manhattan as well as Mr. Trump’s business ties.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesAfter seething over Republican use of the House Intelligence Committee to turn an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election into an attempt to discredit the president’s investigators, Democrats plan to quickly flip the lens back on to Mr. Trump and his campaign itself. But the panel’s leaders have cautioned that their approach will be narrower than once predicted.“We are conscious of the fact that the Senate continues to do their work, Mueller continues to do his work, and at this point in the game, I would not expect the committee to announce an omnibus investigation,” Mr. Himes said. “The time has passed for that.”Instead, Democrats will initially pursue at least two questions — one discreet, the other potentially very complicated — that Republicans in control of the committee would not touch. The panel’s new chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said it was initiating a request for phone records of the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to clarify whom he called while arranging a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer. Phone records already in the hands of congressional investigators show a call was placed to a blocked number, and Donald Trump Jr. told investigators that he did not remember who he had called. Democrats believe the blocked number may have belonged to his father, and could prove that the president had prior knowledge of the Russian offer to share dirt on his opponent, Hillary Clinton.The committee would also like to request financial records related to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Russia and other foreign powers. Intelligence Committee Democrats appear to be circling around two well-known but still mysterious transactions: Mr. Trump’s sale of a Palm Beach, Fla., mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 and loans to the Trump Organization from Deutsche Bank.In the real estate case, Mr. Trump bought a Palm Beach estate for $41 million in 2004 and, only four years later, amid a national housing crisis, sold it to the Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, for $95 million. Democrats say the deal stinks of potential money laundering. Loans from Deutsche Bank — hundreds of millions of dollars extended by a bank later accused in an unrelated case of laundering Russian money during a time when few other major banks would lend to Mr. Trump’s businesses — also raise concerns that Russia could have financial leverage over the president.Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, under Representative Maxine Waters of California, have also been asking questions about the Deutsche loans since early 2017, and plan to press their investigation ahead with the full powers of the majority.Democrats are prepared to subpoena the records if necessary. Mr. Schiff said staff had already begun informal conversations with institutions, potential witnesses and their lawyers about records requests, but because the panel has not technically been appointed yet, formal requests must wait — most likely until the end of January.Mr. Schiff declined to name specific witnesses except Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization’s dealings with Russia and to buying the silence of two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump.Wait, but what about Trump’s tax returns?ImageDemocrats will try to obtain Mr. Trump’s tax returns. CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesDemocrats tried more than a dozen times over the past two years to obtain Mr. Trump’s tax returns. But now that they finally have the opportunity to do so — thanks to an obscure 1920s tax code provision — the relevant Democratic committee chairman appears to be in no rush.In an effort to parry Republican accusations of overreach, the House Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, has decided instead to try to first build a public case for why the returns ought to become public before he lodges a formal request. He plans to convene a hearing this month focused on presidential tax returns in conjunction with sweeping anticorruption legislation that includes language requiring all presidents and candidates to make their returns public.Ultimately, Mr. Neal and Democrats do not need new laws. Sometime after the hearings — probably in February — Mr. Neal plans to invoke Section 6103 in the tax code, which allows chairmen of the House and Senate tax writing committees to request from the Treasury Department tax returns or related information on any tax filer. In theory, committee investigators could then privately study the returns for any compromising or illegal financial dealings. The committee would have to vote to make any of the information public.Whether the administration will put up a fight remains unclear. Mr. Trump has said publicly that he does not care if Democrats pursue the documents; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said he will defer to legal counsel. There is, however, scant precedent for this particular case: Mr. Trump is the first president or major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his returns.The low-hanging fruit: hurricane response, security clearances and government jets.ImageA flooded neighborhood in San Juan, P.R., after Hurricane Maria in September 2017. CreditVictor J. Blue for The New York TimesRepresentative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, had a stern and straightforward message when he sent off 51 oversight letters to cabinet secretaries and Trump Organization lawyers shortly before Christmas: Consider this “a basic first step” and not a voluntary one.As he stands up the House’s marquee investigative committee, Mr. Cummings has deliberately chosen to begin with targets that Republicans once agreed should be studied, but failed to follow up on. They include records related to the administration’s response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated American territories in the Caribbean; Ivanka Trump’s use of a private email account for government business; the use of government jets for personal travel; misconduct by the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt; and the Flint, Mich., water crisis.Laying the groundwork to look for potential violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders, he wrote to the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the company’s procedures for identifying foreign payments. In each, Mr. Cummings said he expected the documents by Friday.
Subpoenas could follow if they are not produced. But much of the committee’s investigative work is likely to remain private in the coming weeks. Other targets appear to be imminent. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, said she and Mr. Cummings agreed they would study what she called the Trump administration’s attempts to manipulate the 2020 census for political gain.“Our whole democracy is based on representation,” Ms. Maloney said, “and if there is a conscious effort to undercount representation, that is an attack fundamentally on our democracy.” Nicholas Fandos is a reporter in the Washington bureau covering Congress.

The government shutdown lives on, but there have been hints of movement.President Trump is still insisting on $5.7 billion for his wall on the southern border, and he announced Saturday that he would extend deportation protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for the wall money.But it looked unlikely that Democrats, who had added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to their funding bills to try to get him to relent, would budge. Eight hundred thousand federal employees are still going without pay.Separately, the president is set to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for a second time, in late February. Their dialogue has eased tensions but hasn’t led to progress in eliminating North Korea’s nuclear arsenal._____ImageCreditStephanie Keith for The New York Times2. Robert Mueller is among the quietest figures in Washington.That changed briefly when the special counsel’s team issued a rare public statement disputing a BuzzFeed News report that said President Trump had directed Michael Cohen, above, his longtime fixer, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.The explosive report had led to a flurry of talk among Democrats about possible impeachment proceedings if the details proved to be accurate.This all came against the backdrop of confirmation hearings for William Barr, the president’s nominee for attorney general. Mr. Barr vowed to let Mr. Mueller finish his inquiry, and he seems all but assured of confirmation._____ImageCreditLeon Neal/Getty Images3. Britain is paralyzed over Brexit.Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a humiliating defeat over her plan to withdraw from the European Union.

BuzzFeed’s Controversial Cohen Story Raises Question: Did Trump Want to Be President? - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion| BuzzFeed’s Controversial Cohen Story Raises Question: Did Trump Want to Be President?AdvertisementOpinionSupported by BuzzFeed’s Controversial Cohen Story Raises Question: Did Trump Want to Be President?His campaign was a marketing venture. That’s why he didn’t want to put business on hold.By Frank BruniOpinion ColumnistJan. 18, 2019ImageCreditCreditBen WisemanThis article has been updated to reflect news developments.Donald Trump hungered for applause — the more frequent and louder, the better. He found that campaign rallies were a source of it like none that he had ever savored.He thrilled to the appearance of his name not just in gold letters on tall buildings but also in newspaper headlines and on television screens. A presidential bid delivered those goods, too.And he wanted ratings. Always, he wanted ratings. “The Apprentice” was a bygone badge. It was time for a bigger, brasher showcase. Running for president offered precisely that.There are several profoundly unsettling takeaways from a breathlessly discussed report by BuzzFeed News that Trump continued to push for a Trump Tower in Moscow deep into his 2016 campaign and later instructed his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about that. A spokesman for Robert Mueller, the special counsel, said late Friday that there were inaccuracies in BuzzFeed’s account.But I’m struck in particular by how the indisputable parts of the BuzzFeed article underscore what many Trump observers have long believed, an insight that explains so much about his eccentric campaign and unethical governance: He never really expected to be president. More than that, he never really hoped to be.That’s why he didn’t put business matters on hold or disentangle himself from glaring conflicts of interest. That’s why he refused to yoke himself to the sorts of rules that his predecessors had endeavored to follow.That’s why he indulged in behavior that would come back to haunt him in the White House: He never planned on moving there. He wasn’t supposed to come under this kind of glare or have to lie this much (though lying comes easily to him). If victory had really been the point, he might not have left himself so exposed.The BuzzFeed report, published late Thursday, cites two unnamed law enforcement sources, and other news organizations have approached the scoop with varying degrees of caution and have been unable to corroborate it. If the account holds up, it’s arguably the clearest evidence yet that Trump obstructed justice, recommending perjury in an effort to cloak his interests in Russia as Mueller investigated that very matter.Regardless of the report’s veracity, we already know that Cohen pursued the Moscow project through June 2016 but falsely told lawmakers that he’d wrapped up that work the previous January: Last November he pleaded guilty to lying under oath.We also know that Trump didn’t want his candidacy to foil lucrative deals and dilute his wealth. He publicly defended the fact that the Moscow project didn’t end when his campaign began, telling reporters, “There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?” Sacrifice isn’t his strong suit.He had neither the requisite knowledge nor experience to serve as president. Now we know he wasn’t prepared psychologically, either. His campaign wasn’t a rehearsal for civic leadership. It was a brand-burnishing interregnum, a time-limited adventure in egomania.“Donald Trump never thought he was going to be president,” the Trump biographer Timothy O’Brien, who wrote “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,” told me. “He began this thing as a marketing venture, and I don’t think the people around him thought he was going to win, either. They all jointly saw this thing as a big food fest.”Paul Manafort would cycle back into commercial viability and political relevance. Jared Kushner would find a financial savior for 666 Fifth Avenue, his family’s towering albatross. Ivanka Trump would add weight to her cottony image. And her father, well, he’d be exponentially more famous, and there’s never fame enough.“It had nothing to do with public policy,” O’Brien said. “It had everything to do with short-term opportunism.”Major books about Trump’s campaign and election explore variations of the theme that victory surprised Trump and his enablers and caught them flat-footed. Michael Lewis’s most recent best seller, “The Fifth Risk,” begins with a damning account of the Trump team’s failure to carry out a coherent transition and fill key jobs in government.In “Fire and Fury,” Michael Wolff writes that “Trump refused to spend any time considering, however hypothetically, transition matters, saying it was ‘bad luck’ — but really meaning it was a waste of time.”“He wasn’t going to win,” Wolff continues. “Or losing was winning. Trump would be the most famous man in the world — a martyr to crooked Hillary Clinton.”“Losing would work out for everybody,” he adds.Michael D’Antonio, the author of “The Truth About Trump,” told me: “His past is not a past someone brings into the presidency, and he’s not so stupid that he wouldn’t have understood that. And I think he naturally feared the kind of examination that he’s undergone since the election.”But because he wasn’t going to win, it wouldn’t matter that he’d paid off women with whom he’d had affairs, that he’d dispatched Cohen on so many unsavory errands, that he’d surrounded himself with such shady characters, that he refused to release his tax returns, that he forged ahead with the Trump International Hotel in Washington, that he vulgarly insulted the very lawmakers a president would need to collaborate with and that he surrendered any claim to moral authority by trafficking in racism and xenophobia. There would be no consequences because there would be no crown.“This was a publicity gambit,” D’Antonio said. “It’s almost as if he believed that his candidacy was a joke, so under that circumstance, rigging polls and shouting about locking her up and issuing these racially charged lies about immigrants was O.K., because he wasn’t going to be president anyway. What he was doing was trying out ideas for his persona.”Through that lens, this presidency and its shortcomings make complete sense. Trump couldn’t assemble and manage a top-notch cabinet because he’d never readied himself for that task. He couldn’t let go of any of the engines of his wealth because he’d never prioritized public service above it. He couldn’t say what the country needed him to after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., because he had no interest in the role of statesman and had never intended to play it. Rare is the person who finds a whole new skill set at his stage of the game, and rarer still is the person who finds a whole new set of principles.“I think he’s well aware of his lack of intellectual sophistication and patience and maturity and competence, which is why he’s always speaking to those faults in public venues,” O’Brien said. “He knows deep down inside that he’s not up to the demands of the office.”Two years into his presidency, the rest of us know it, too.RelatedMueller Statement Disputes Report That Trump Directed Cohen to LieJan. 18, 2019I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.

By Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. ZelizerMr. Kruse and Mr. Zelizer are the authors of “Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.” Jan. 9, 2019ImagePresident Trump has illustrated that even a feeble commander in chief can impose his will on the nation.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesFor all his bluster, Donald Trump is generally seen by presidential observers as a shockingly weak president. Brought to office in an election in which he lost the popular vote, his approval ratings have remained consistently low. Even with his party in control of the White House and Congress for two years, beyond a typical Republican tax cut, Mr. Trump failed to secure a signature legislative accomplishment. The president may seem weak, but the presidency remains strong. Mr. Trump has illustrated that even a feeble commander in chief can impose his will on the nation if he lacks any sense of restraint or respect for political norms and guardrails. True, Mr. Trump has not been able to run roughshod over Congress or ignore the constraints of the federal courts. But he has been able to inflict extensive damage on our political institutions and public culture. He has used his power to aggravate, rather than calm, the fault lines that have divided our country.His “wall” government shutdown is the latest example of his misuse of executive power. To end this essentially pointless standoff of his own making, he is exploring the use of national emergency powers to build a wall Congress and a majority of the public don’t want.The Trump administration has provided a new example of an old concept: the “imperial presidency.” That term, famously used by the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1973 to describe the excesses and abuses of the Nixon White House, fell out of use almost as soon as President Richard Nixon fell from grace. The reckoning of Watergate and the first-ever resignation of a president seemed to show that the executive branch was not as uncontrollable as it had once seemed. Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.The National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president’s power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.Despite these reforms, four decades later, the “imperial presidency” still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?The most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support. Since the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one’s own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.Republicans have done much in the same vein, in moments of divided and united government alike. Republicans have also gone a step further to protect the party’s electoral interests through the use of, for instance, strict voter-ID laws. Aggressive presidents also depend on a partisan media to do their work without too much pushback. President Trump has demonstrated how this could be turned into a powerful tool for the White House. Mr. Trump has routinely repeated stories seen on the “Fox & Friends” morning program and leaned on conservative cable hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs for advice as well. Indeed, the line between the Trump White House and conservative media outlets has become blurred beyond recognition. The former CNBC host Larry Kudlow now serves as head of the National Economic Council, while the former “Fox & Friends” host Heather Nauert has been nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Bill Shine, a former executive at Fox News, now runs the White House Communications Office. The imperial presidency is, in many ways, propped up by media partisans who insist that the naked emperor has glorious new clothes.Mr. Trump has revealed that the president can act “imperially” because norms matter as much as rules and procedure. The reformers of the 1970s missed the ways in which reforms simply cannot restrain a president who doesn’t care about institutions. The most important source of presidential restraint has been the character of the person in office. For all his flaws, Mr. Nixon was unwilling to tear down the government to save himself. Mr. Trump has revealed that when a president is willing to cross what seemed to be clear lines, no one is there to hold him back.With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the Mueller investigation seemingly coming to a conclusion as well, Mr. Trump will likely be held to account, in one form or another. But it’s important to remember that the “imperial presidency” will outlive any one president unless more is done to institute real checks and balances on the office itself.Congress has the most effective means of putting new limits on the White House through oversight. Many of the tools that Congress needs are right in front of it — holding serious hearings about the material in a Mueller report or making sure that legislation like the National Emergency Act is enforced — but it must use them.If Mr. Trump invokes emergency power to build a wall, Congress needs to respond by passing legislation that will take back some of the power it granted in 1976.Most important, reforming presidential power will fall on the shoulders of voters. In the end, the most effective check on presidential power is to elect presidents who will exercise their authority with some restraint and respect our democratic institutions. That is the choice voters will have in 2020.Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E.

She said that she was told: “It’s O.K. No problem.”CreditCreditChristopher Gregory for The New York TimesBy Miriam JordanJan. 3, 2019Leer en españolA former employee of the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey said that her name was removed from a list of workers to be vetted by the Secret Service after she reminded management that she was unlawfully in the United States, the latest worker to assert that supervisors at the elite resort were aware that some members of their work force were undocumented.The Bedminster golf club has recently terminated several workers who were determined to be ineligible to work in the country, according to several people familiar with the matter, following a New York Times report that revealed that immigrants who presented false documents were knowingly kept on the payroll, sometimes for years.A lawyer representing the women has met with investigators from the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, presenting what he said was evidence that managers at the golf club knew that some workers were in the country illegally, and that at least one supervisor helped an employee obtain forged working documents.In the latest revelation, Emma Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador who prepared food at the club, said that members of the kitchen staff were asked in 2016, as Donald J. Trump was in the midst of his campaign for the White House, to write their names, addresses and other details, including their Social Security numbers, on a list of employees that would be submitted to the Secret Service for clearance.The golf club has been a favorite place for vacation and business meetings for Mr. Trump.“When I learned this is for the Secret Service to see the records of everyone because they are giving protection to Mr. Trump, I rushed to human resources,” Ms. Torres said in an interview. “I thought, God, what will I do?” Ms. Torres said she had used a fake Social Security number when she applied for her job.She said that she told a human resources employee, whose name she does not know, that she did not have legal status. She said that the woman replied, “‘It’s O.K. No problem.’ She scratched me off the list.”The woman then asked Ms. Torres for names of other kitchen workers who might be undocumented, which Ms. Torres said she provided.There is no evidence that Mr. Trump knew of the unlawful status of employees at the club. But halting illegal immigration, by stanching the influx across the border, and deporting immigrants living inside the country have been core priorities of his administration. Mr. Trump has demanded $5 billion in funding to erect a wall along the United States-Mexico border to help block the flow of immigrants, leading to a stalemate with Democrats that has resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government.In a statement to the Times on Dec. 7, the Trump Organization, which owns the New Jersey golf club, pledged to terminate any workers it found to have been hired using fraudulent documents, which are typically a made-up Social Security number and green card.Managers at the golf club and at Trump International did not respond to requests for comment on Ms. Torres’s account. A Secret Service spokeswoman, Cathy L. Milhoan, said she could not discuss what measures the agency took to vet employees at the golf club. “The U.S. Secret Service does not comment on our protective operations to include the administration of our name check program,” she said in a statement.Ms. Torres said she believes the undocumented workers she identified to management also had their names removed from the list given to the Secret Service, but all of them, she said, remained on staff at the resort.At least one other undocumented employee at the resort, Victorina Morales, a native of Guatemala who had been illegally in the United States since 1999, said she was given a Secret Service pin to wear when the president was in residence at the club. Secret Service officials said the pin did not signify that she had passed any security clearance.Ms. Torres, 43, said she was hired to work at the resort in early 2015 using a falsified Social Security number and permanent resident card. She had informed a manager during her job interview that both were phony, she said, and the documents were photocopied for club files when she started working there.After a few months working as a housekeeper, Ms. Torres said she complained to management about what she felt was abusive treatment by the housekeeping supervisor and was moved to the kitchen, where she started as a dishwasher. She said she worked her way up to assistant to the chef, earning $14.50 an hour.Among other tasks, Ms. Torres noted that she made sandwiches for Secret Service agents when they began visiting the property. She also prepared food for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump had praised her work and tipped her when she was in housekeeping, Ms. Torres recalled. But she and other former employees who have spoken with The Times said they grew increasingly uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s derogatory comments about immigrants during his campaign. “When he won the election, fear took over me,” Ms. Torres said. “I felt I was in the lion’s den. I had to leave.”Ms. Torres quit in early 2017, after finding another job.Since The Times’s initial report that the golf club employed undocumented immigrants, three additional immigrants have come forward, saying that they used fraudulent documents to secure jobs there and that management was aware of their illegal status.Ms. Morales was still working at the club when The Times published its report, but has not returned to work since. She said that when her initial fraudulent green card expired, a manager at the club arranged for her to be driven to a place where she could obtain new counterfeit documents. She said he lent her money to purchase them.Since the article was published, the Trump Organization has been quietly scrambling to bring its golf club work force into compliance, according to former employees who have been in contact with colleagues at the club. Checking whether employees are authorized to work in the United States has resulted in the termination of about a dozen people, according to these workers and another source familiar with the organization’s workings, though management at the club has not confirmed their accounts.More broadly, the company is reviewing its staff at many properties to ensure they are authorized to work in the country, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A lawyer representing some of the undocumented former employees, Anibal Romero, contacted the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Office of the Special Counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in October. Mr. Mueller’s office then referred the case to the F.B.I., said Mr. Romero, who said that both state and federal authorities contacted him in November. Mr. Romero said that he handed over, among other material, the false documents that a manager had helped Ms. Morales obtain.Neither state nor federal authorities have confirmed that they are conducting a full-scale investigation into the matter.A spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general said that “as a general matter, our office does not confirm or deny investigations.” A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment.Ben Protess contributed reporting.

By Penn BullockJan. 9, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. President Trump’s address to the American people, new details in the Russia investigation and a 210-foot “fatberg.” Here’s the latest: ImagePresident Trump addressing the nation from the Oval Office.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesA prime-time clash over the U.S. shutdownOn the 18th day of the partial government shutdown, President Trump gave a national address from the White House, citing misleading statistics to declare that there is a “humanitarian and security crisis” on the southern border and demanding billions of dollars in funding for a wall, which he claimed would be “indirectly paid for” by Mexico. That was one of many assertions we fact-checked in a live briefing on the address.In a Democratic rebuttal moments later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, joined by Senator Chuck Schumer, said that Mr. Trump “must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.” On the ground: Americans living near the border show little enthusiasm for a wall. Looking ahead: Mr. Trump will travel to the Texas border on Thursday. But privately, he has dismissed his own new strategy of persuading the American people as pointless, and the shutdown is set to drag on. For many federal workers, that means no paychecks. So far, polls show Mr. Trump taking most of the blame for the shutdown, and Senate Republicans are increasingly anxious. Video: Watch his address and Democrats’ response. (And here are the full transcripts.)ImagePaul Manafort arriving at a federal courthouse in Washington in June.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesAccidental revelations in the Russia investigationPaul Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with an associate tied to Russian intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert Mueller. That was inadvertently made public in court filings by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, who did not directly dispute that the sharing happened but said their client had not intended to mislead Mr. Mueller about it, blaming a memory lapse. They also revealed that Mr. Manafort “may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan” with the Russian associate “on more than one occasion.”What’s next: His lawyers said Mr. Manafort would not pursue a formal challenge to prosecutors’ assertions that he lied in breach of a cooperation agreement, a decision that brings him one step closer to being sentenced for 10 felonies.Also: Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with President Trump’s campaign team at Trump Tower in 2016, was charged in New York in a separate case that showed her deep ties to the Kremlin.ImageTrucks driving to the British port of Dover in a test of how a “no deal” withdrawal from the E.U. might affect traffic. CreditNeil Hall/EPA, via ShutterstockU.K.’s mixed signals on no-deal Brexit: Keep calm and panicAhead of a momentous debate in the British Parliament over Prime Minister Theresa May’s unpopular plan for leaving the E.U., her government has been preparing for a possible “no deal” withdrawal.But it has offered contradictory messages: that such an exit would be a calamity for Britain, and that it would not be, because the government is prepared.Details: As part of its preparations, in the past week the government has awarded a $17.5 million ferry service contract to a company with no ferries, as well as conducting an exercise — dismissed by truck drivers who took part as “window dressing” — to test whether Britain could handle a no-deal scenario’s expected snarls for cross-channel trade. Another angle: Backing farmers’ fears, the environment minister warned of huge tariffs and resulting devastation for British agriculture in a no-deal exit.ImageSupporters of Spain's far-right Vox party in Seville, celebrating the results of regional elections in Andalusia last month.CreditGogo Lobato/Associated PressThe far right gains a toehold in SpainIn December, the nationalist, anti-immigrant Vox party of Spain won parliamentary seats for the first time. Big picture: Vox remains a small player. It wants to replace border fences around Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa, with walls, and reclaim Gibraltar from Britain. It has consulted with President Trump’s former campaign manager Stephen Bannon, who is trying to build an international far-right movement. And its popularity has grown with a backlash against Catalan separatism, which is rekindling Spanish nationalism long after the Franco era. Looking ahead: Some analysts say the party’s appeal could spread beyond its stronghold in the southern region of Andalusia, and it will be an important wild card in E.U. parliamentary elections in May.In Germany: A lawmaker from the far-right Alternative for Germany party suffered serious injuries when he was attacked by three men, the police said.Here’s what else is happeningTurkey: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused to meet with John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, after Mr. Bolton said Turkey must agree to protect Syria’s Kurds — making an agreement between the two countries ahead of an announced U.S. withdrawal from Syria more difficult.Emissions: U.S. carbon dioxide output rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate. The uptick came even as a near-record number of coal plants across the country closed last year.ImageDavid Dragicevic at a protest in Banja Luka, Bosnia, on Dec. 30.

China: In an effort to placate President Trump and end a trade war with the U.S., China has offered real concessions — alongside nebulous promises that may not be enough. Iran: The E.U. penalized the country over allegations that its intelligence service orchestrated a series of assassination plots in Europe in recent years, including the killing of two Iranians in the Netherlands. Diplomacy: The Trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the E.U. delegation to the U.S. last year without telling the bloc, a European official said on Tuesday. The reclassification is understood to have been reversed, at least temporarily. Germany: The government revealed that a 20-year-old student was responsible for hacking into the online accounts of hundreds of lawmakers and personalities whose political stances he disliked, cracking passwords as weak as “1234.”Fatberg: A 210-foot mass of oils, fats and wet wipes — longer than the Tower of Pisa is tall — has been discovered under a sleepy coastal town in Britain.Smarter Living Tips for a more fulfilling life.ImageCreditJulia Gartland for The New York TimesRecipe of the day: Smoky bacon, red cabbage and a bit of cream make for a delicious pasta dinner.A simple way to remember things?

And he refused to directly answer.The question, which came from a friendly interviewer, not one of the “fake media” journalists he disparages, was “the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he declared. But it is a question that has hung over his presidency now for two years.If the now 23-day government shutdown standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress has seemed ugly, it may eventually seem tame in light of what is to come. The border wall fight is just the preliminary skirmish in this new era of divided government. The real battle has yet to begin.With Democrats now in charge of the House, the special counsel believed to be wrapping up his investigation, news media outlets competing for scoops and the first articles of impeachment already filed, Mr. Trump faces the prospect of an all-out political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison.The last few days have offered plenty of foreshadowing. The newly empowered Democrats summoned the president’s longtime personal lawyer to testify after he implicated Mr. Trump in an illegal scheme to arrange hush payments before the 2016 election for women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Legal papers disclosed that Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate tied by prosecutors to Russian intelligence.New reports over the weekend added to the sense of siege at the White House. The New York Times reported that after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in 2017, the bureau opened an investigation into whether the president was working for the Russians. And The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump has gone out of his way as president to hide the details of his discussions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even from members of his own administration.What all this adds up to remains unclear. Whether it will lead to a full-blown impeachment inquiry in the House has yet to be decided. But it underscores the chance that with candidates already lining up to take him on in 2020, Washington will spend the months to come debating the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency and the direction of the country.“The reality,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former special assistant to Mr. Trump, is “that the next two years are going to be nonstop political war.”The White House has begun recruiting soldiers. The new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, has hired 17 new lawyers, according to The Post, as he prepares for a barrage of subpoenas from House Democratic committee chairmen.But Mr. Trump’s inner circle has shrunk, and he has fewer advisers around him whom he trusts. His White House chief of staff is still serving in an acting capacity, and the West Wing is depleted by the shutdown. As he himself wrote on Twitter this weekend, “There’s almost nobody in the W.H. but me.”Mr. Surabian said the rest of the party must recognize the threat and rally behind the president. “Republicans need to understand that Democrats in Congress, beholden to the ‘resistance,’ aren’t interested in bipartisanship, they’re out for blood,” he said. “It’s a war we can win,” he added, “but only with fortitude, unity, coherent messaging and a willingness to fight back.”Democrats, for their part, say they are out for accountability, not blood, intent on forcing a president who went largely unchecked by a Republican Congress during his first two years in office to come clean on the many scandals that have erupted involving his business, taxes, campaign and administration.They plan to get started in the coming days. On Tuesday, they will grill former Attorney General William P. Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office again, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Barr wrote a private memo last year criticizing Mr. Mueller’s investigation, and Democrats will use his confirmation hearings to press him on whether the special counsel will be allowed to finish his work and report it to Congress.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, also plans to force a vote in the Senate this week on the Trump administration’s plans to lifts sanctions on the companies of Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to Mr. Putin’s government, if he reduces his ownership stakes. Democrats plan to use the issue to argue that Mr. Trump has been soft on Russia.Even committees that are not usually in the investigation business are jumping into the fray. Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The New Yorker last week that he was eliminating the subcommittee on terrorism in favor of a subcommittee aimed at investigating Mr. Trump’s foreign policy.Lost in all this may be any chance of bipartisan policymaking. At stake in the current fight is just $5.7 billion for Mr. Trump’s promised border wall, roughly one-eighth of one percent of the total federal budget. If one-eighth of one percent of the total budget can prompt the longest government shutdown in American history, then the potential for further clashes over the remaining 99.87 percent seems considerable. On issues like health care, taxes, climate change, guns and national security, the two sides start this era of divided government far apart.“That’s the flashing yellow light here,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former top White House aide to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. “If you can’t do Government 101, what makes you think you’re going to do Advanced Placement Government like finding the money for an infrastructure bill?”Julian Epstein, who was the counsel for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during Mr. Clinton’s impeachment fight 20 years ago, said big issues like a shrinking middle class largely untrained for the 21st-century economy would go unaddressed during the battles to come.“The political class is now addicted to Manichaean conflict as a way of life,” Mr. Epstein said. “It’s become the mother’s milk — for base voters in both parties who together make up a minority share of voters, for cable television and for social media.”Given the investigations, Mr. Trump may prefer a battle over the wall as more favorable ground to fight even with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay. Polls suggest he is not winning with the broader public but has rallied his base in the fight.More Americans blame Mr. Trump for the government shutdown than blame Democrats, and most oppose a border wall, according to a new survey by The Post and ABC News. But support for a wall has grown over the last year from 34 percent to 42 percent, fueled largely by Republicans, while opposition has slipped from 63 percent to 54 percent.Negotiations have broken down. While Mr. Trump had gambled that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, would back down, she has made clear that she has no interest in compromise. She and Mr. Schumer have insisted that Mr. Trump reopen the government while negotiations over a border wall proceed, which the president has refused to do. Mr. Trump walked out of their talks last week after he asked Ms. Pelosi if she would support his wall if he reopened the government and she said no.“It’s all about their own sense of strength,” said John Feehery, a former senior House Republican aide. “Pelosi wants to be validated. She wants to be seen as a strong leader. Trump feels like he has to govern through strength. This is strength versus strength. Unfortunately, the people in the middle are the government workers who can’t afford to lose a paycheck.”Instead of talks to end the shutdown, the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for Mr. Putin. He insisted that he has actually been tougher on Russia than his predecessors and that the F.B.I. was led by “losers that tried to do a number on your President.”He picked up the telephone on Saturday night to call into the Fox News show hosted by Jeanine Pirro, who participated in a campaign rally with him last fall. She asked him about the F.B.I. investigation reported by The Times with a tone of scorn.“I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?” Ms. Pirro asked.“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he answered. “I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you’d see that they found absolutely nothing.”She then cited the Post article about his efforts to conceal details of his private meetings with Mr. Putin. “We had a great conversation,” he said. “We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things, and it was a great conversation. I’m not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn’t care less.”Ms. Pirro expressed sympathy for the battles he was waging.“You’ve got such fight in you, it’s unbelievable,” she said.“Well,” he answered, “I guess I have good genes.”Correction: Jan. 14, 2019An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s schedule during the shutdown. Her staff said she was in Washington over the weekend. The article said she had left town.

Here, there is smoke and mirrors.By Roger CohenOpinion ColumnistJan. 11, 2019ImagePresident Trump, according to this columnist, just can't help himself.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesWatching the Trump show from the distance afforded by my brief leave of absence has been like watching a frenzy of ants. It’s hypnotic, in part because it appears devoid of meaning. Keep your eye on the bouncing ball, goes the adage. But what if the ball is a blur?When Trump was in business, his shtick was stiffing contractors. If confronted, he would try some bombast and storm out of meetings, as he did the other day with congressional leaders, ending talks on the partial government shutdown caused by a crisis he has manufactured. His shtick now is stiffing all Americans. The technique is the same: Keep reality at a distance through hyperactive fakery.I have been fascinated by Trump’s compulsion. Like birds feasting on mangled flesh in the middle of the road, he cannot help it. Like travelers beset with reflex gluttony in airline lounges, he cannot help it. Like the sulking child denied a video, he cannot help it.Like the dog that returns to its vomit, he cannot help it. Like a puppet on a string, he cannot help it. Like the scorpion that stings the frog ferrying it across the torrent, he cannot help it. It’s his nature, you see.A manufactured crisis, I said. It’s worth recalling the 5,200 troops ordered to the southern border before the midterm elections to confront the “caravan of migrants.” This was an exercise in manipulative illusion.Monthly crossings over the southern border have declined in recent years. The number of migrants apprehended has also fallen over the past decade, with a recent tick upward. There is no humanitarian crisis, just as not a single mile of additional wall has been built since Trump took office. But absent this noise, what does reality offer the president? Robert Mueller, Nancy Pelosi and Michael Cohen, the specters of his insomnia.One of the books I read while away included Harry G. Frankfurt’s seminal essay, “On Bullshit.” Here I must excuse myself with readers who may find the bull word offensive. Please look away from the rest of this column. There really is no alternative to it, for Donald Trump is the Michelangelo of bullshit artists.The essential distinction that Frankfurt, a professor of philosophy emeritus at Princeton University, makes is between lies and bull. As he writes, “It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction.”It is a habit “unconstrained by a concern with truth” whose essence is “not of falsity but of fakery.” The addict of bull “does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.” He is “trying to get away with something.” His “focus is panoramic rather than particular,” and he shuns “the more austere and rigorous demands of lying.”Frankfurt’s conclusion may be read as an ominous verdict on this president. The bull merchant “does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.”It has been said that Trump’s extraordinary election victory owed much to his intuitions about the anger in the heartland. There is some truth in this. But his essential intuition was into the readiness of Americans, suspended between the real and the virtual, for a post-truth presidency.Quinta Jurecic, in an important essay for the Lawfare Blog, set out the dangers inherent in this shift before Trump took office. In the essay, “On Bullshit and the Oath of Office: The ‘LOL Nothing Matters’ Presidency,” she cited Frankfurt and argued that Trump’s “foundational disrespect for meaning and consequence” — that is to say, for reality and the very concept of law — would make it “impossible for Donald Trump to faithfully execute the laws of this nation and the duties of the oath of office and to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.”The president’s apparent readiness to “do national emergency,” as he put it, over a manufactured border crisis amounts to a perfect illustration of this danger. The Reichstag fire was at least a fire. Here there is only smoke and mirrors.I would add one element to the reflections of Frankfurt and Jurecic on bull. There may be something amusing, or at least innocuous, about the bullshit artists encountered in a lifetime. They may be waved away. But in Trump the element of sadistic cruelty in his personality (mocking the disabled, for example), and the sheer gall of his fakery, make of him a malignant, rather than a benign, bullshit artist. He happens to occupy the world’s most powerful office.Trump cannot help himself, I said. He can’t and won’t. But as citizens, “we have a duty to insist that words have meaning,” as Jurecic writes. If they don’t, neither does the Republic. That’s what the ants told me as I gazed at them, troubled and fixated.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Roger Cohen has been a columnist for The Times since 2009.

In her speech, Ms. Pelosi emphasized the significance of presiding over the most diverse group of lawmakers in U.S. history.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Julie Hirschfeld DavisJan. 3, 2019WASHINGTON — Ebullient Democrats assumed control of the House on Thursday and elected Representative Nancy Pelosi of California speaker, returning her to a historic distinction as the first woman to hold the post. They then moved to defy President Trump and passed bills that would open government agencies shuttered by an impasse over his insistence on funding for a border wall. Both measures are almost certain to die in the Senate.On the first day of divided government in a reordered Washington, Ms. Pelosi, now second in line to the presidency, and Mr. Trump clashed from their respective ends of Pennsylvania Avenue almost from dawn until dusk.The California Democrat began her day by suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted. Late in the day, Mr. Trump made an attention-getting appearance in the White House briefing room with a belligerent demand for a wall on the border with Mexico, drawing a rebuke from the newly installed House speaker, who said she would give no more than a dollar to fund what she branded “an immorality.”In between, as the start of the new House showcased a younger and more diverse majority in the staid corridors of the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi pledged to run a “unifying” Congress that would bridge partisan divides and heal rifts in a polarized country.“Our nation is at a historic moment,” she declared. “I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying, that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this country, and across divisions across our nation.”ImageMs. Pelosi posed for pictures with her family on the Speaker’s balcony before the start of the 116th Congress.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesIn ascending to the speakership, Ms. Pelosi finds herself at the fulcrum of a bitterly divided body politic, poised to do battle with and demand accountability from an increasingly combative Mr. Trump in ways that the Republican Congress of the past two years refused to. With Mr. Trump, his presidential campaign and his businesses all under federal and state investigations, Ms. Pelosi’s approach to confronting him — both through investigation and legislation — will probably define the 116th Congress.She wasted no time in doing so on Thursday, hours after being sworn in. The late-night, nearly party-line votes on reopening the government began a pattern in an era of divided control, with a Democratic House passing legislation that has no chance of being signed by the Republican president, and the Republican Senate running interference to protect Mr. Trump. The White House had also issued an official statement threatening a veto.“Let’s not waste the time,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.Mr. Trump used his abrupt appearance in the White House briefing room — his first since taking office — to talk about the importance of the wall; he was flanked by border agents who echoed his message.The president congratulated Ms. Pelosi on her election and said he had high aspirations for the new Congress. But he turned immediately to making the case for a wall that Democrats have uniformly rejected, saying, “Without a wall, you cannot have border security.” Mr. Trump also used social media to press his message, posting on his Instagram account a photograph of his face with the text “The Wall Is Coming,” a take on an advertisement for the cable TV series “Game of Thrones” that bore the ominous slogan “Winter Is Coming.”As afternoon turned to evening and the votes to reopen the government approached, Ms. Pelosi told reporters sarcastically, in response to a question, that she would give him $1 — but only that — for the wall.Meet the New Freshmen in CongressThe congressional freshman class of 2019 includes the most racially diverse and most female group of representatives ever elected to the House.“We’re not doing a wall,” Ms. Pelosi said sternly outside the House chamber. “Does anybody have any doubt that we’re not doing a wall? So that’s that.”That capped a day that began with a warning shot to Mr. Trump, suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted.“I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law,” Ms. Pelosi said in an interview on NBC.In a statement that served as a two-pronged warning, both to her left flank and to the president, she said that the House would not move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump, but would not shy away from doing so if it were warranted.“We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,” Ms. Pelosi said, referring to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. “We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we’ll just have to see how it comes.”VideoThe 116th Congress, with the House in Democratic control, came to order on Thursday. Lawmakers voted to elect Representative Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York Times[Read here for all of the day’s events.]By early afternoon, partisan politics were put aside, if only briefly, for a transition of power from Republicans to Democrats, as a majority of lawmakers rose in turn from their seats on the House floor to utter Ms. Pelosi’s name and formally award her the gavel she gave up in 2011.Ms. Pelosi ascended to the marble dais in the center of the House chamber with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming Republican leader, who handed her the wooden gavel.ImageRepresentative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, hugged her son after being sworn into Congress.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times“To the speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi,” he said, “I extend to you the gavel.” The room erupted into applause as she held it aloft.Moments later, with a “Come on, kids!” Ms. Pelosi invited the children and grandchildren of representatives on the floor of the House to surround her as she took the oath of office, becoming the first person since Representative Sam Rayburn more than 60 years ago to reclaim the speakership after losing it.“I now call the House to order on behalf of all of America’s children,” Ms. Pelosi said after she was sworn in.But even in its pledges of unity and a new bipartisan spirit, Ms. Pelosi managed some subtle swipes at the president and his party. At one point while discussing immigration, she quoted President Ronald Reagan.“He said, ‘If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership role in the world will soon be lost,’” Ms. Pelosi said, drawing a standing ovation from Democrats in the well of the House, but grim-faced silence from most of those seated on the Republican side.“You don’t applaud for Ronald Reagan?” she scoffed.The scene was strikingly different on the other side of the chamber, where some Democrats wore the traditional clothing of their communities — a Palestinian thobe, a Muslim hijab or head scarf, a Pueblo dress. It was a visual change in a chamber that has for centuries been overwhelmingly white and male.ImageMs. Pelosi hugged other members of Congress after being elected speaker.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesAs promised, Democrats approved bills intended to reopen the government and to remake rules of the House. One of the spending bills would fund most shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30 and the other is a stopgap measure to restart the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks.Earlier, they approved a suite of new rules that will set the tone for their majority, including a measure — opposed by liberal members — to require that any policy mandating new funding be accompanied with corresponding tax increases or spending cuts. Another change would automatically raise the statutory limit on the national debt when the House approves a budget, avoiding politically difficult votes each time the ceiling is reached, which dogged Republicans and led to a series of fiscal cliffhangers during their years in the majority.Also included were revisions to ensure that bipartisan proposals could be more easily considered, pushed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers billing themselves the Problem Solvers Caucus.Ms. Pelosi’s election was not without dissent. Having spent more than 15 years at the helm of her party and been demonized by Republicans during the midterm congressional elections as the face of far-left radicalism, Ms. Pelosi, 78, spent the weeks after Democrats won putting down a rebellion over her leadership in Democratic ranks and consolidating support through a combination of deal-cutting and cajoling.She suffered more than a dozen defections: the freshman representatives Anthony Brindisi of New York, Jason Crow of Colorado, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah, Max Rose of New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jared Golden of Maine, as well as Representatives Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Kathleen Rice of New York.Many of the newly elected members had campaigned calling for change in Washington and for a new generation of leadership for their party, and had promised not to vote for Ms. Pelosi. As part of a final deal to shore up support, Ms. Pelosi agreed to limit her speakership to four years.ImageWorkers placed a new sign above Ms. Pelosi’s office door.CreditPete Marovich for The New York TimesBut two of the ringleaders of the squelched effort to depose Ms. Pelosi, Representatives Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, ultimately voted for her.With her re-election, the biggest Republican super PAC — and the one that arguably tried the hardest in 2018 to link Democratic candidates to Ms. Pelosi — practically celebrated. “Democratic candidates spent the last two years promising voters that they’d be different — they wouldn’t stand for the same old leadership and the same old way of doing business in Washington,” the super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, said in a statement. “Yet with the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them.”The National Republican Congressional Committee, the party’s House campaign arm, wasted no time in targeting Democrats in competitive districts who voted for Ms. Pelosi, sending voters in their districts texts immediately after the vote, saying that their representatives “are once again ignoring your voice.”“Fight back NOW!” the texts read.The swift political broadsides drew condemnation from Ms. Pelosi’s team.“They threw everything but the kitchen sink at Nancy Pelosi, and her strategy powered by her fund-raising turned 43 red seats blue,” said Drew Hammill, her spokesman. “They wasted tens of millions failing from coast to coast in a tired strategy that did nothing to save their majority.”But amid that partisan acrimony, the spirit of a new generation of Democrats was in evidence in the well of the House. Several lawmakers bounced or rocked infants as they cast their votes for speaker, while Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, at 29 the youngest person to be elected to the House, made a heart sign with her hands at loved ones in the gallery above. Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, voted for Ms. Pelosi for the “future of our children,” she said, while her own two children dabbed beside her.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Trump’s Pick for Attorney General Faces Heat Over Opposition to Whistle-Blower LawAdvertisementSupported byTrump’s Pick for Attorney General Faces Heat Over Opposition to Whistle-Blower LawImageSenator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, met with William P. Barr last week.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesBy Robert PearJan. 14, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, has expressed extreme hostility to whistle-blower protections in federal law that allow private citizens to win financial rewards for exposing fraud in federal programs.Mr. Barr’s views on executive power and the investigation of President Trump by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will hold much of the spotlight Tuesday, but he will also come under sharp pressure to renounce his position on whistle-blower protections at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.That is because the whistle-blower law is strongly supported by a Republican whose vote he needs, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.“I’m confident that he understands the significance of this law to fight fraud and guard taxpayer dollars,” Mr. Grassley said Monday, promising to press the nominee at Tuesday’s hearing.As an assistant attorney general in the first Bush administration in 1989, Mr. Barr wrote a lengthy legal opinion asserting that the law was unconstitutional. The law poses “a devastating threat” to presidential authority and replaces the prosecutorial discretion of the Justice Department with “the mercenary motives of private bounty hunters,” he wrote.Mr. Barr acknowledged that the law, which allows private citizens to sue on behalf of the government, had roots that went back to 14th century England and the earliest days of the American Republic. But he said that George Washington and other framers of the Constitution would probably not have accepted it if they had “fully understood its implications.”When he wrote the opinion, Mr. Barr was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that provides legal advice to the president and the attorney general.He was assailing the False Claims Act, which authorizes any person to file a lawsuit “in the name of the government” to recover damages and penalties from anyone who has knowingly submitted a false or fraudulent request for payment of federal dollars.If confirmed, Mr. Barr would be in charge of administering and enforcing the law and working with whistle-blowers.But first, he must navigate through a committee full of supporters of the law he has called “an abomination.”Besides Mr. Grassley, the whistle-blower law has been backed strongly by Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, both Democrats. Another member of the panel, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, used her state’s False Claims Act to pursue fraud in Medicaid and the mortgage industry when she was attorney general of California.Mr. Barr’s objections to the False Claims Act were consistent with his expansive view of presidential power.“The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the authority to enforce the laws is a core power vested in the Executive,” Mr. Barr wrote. “The False Claims Act effectively strips this power away from the Executive and vests it in private individuals, depriving the Executive of sufficient supervision and control over the exercise of these sovereign powers.”The False Claims Act, also known as Lincoln’s law, was adopted in 1863 in response to rampant fraud by contractors who cheated the government by selling the Union Army sick mules, lame horses and sawdust instead of gunpowder.In 1986, Congress strengthened the law by increasing incentives for whistle-blowers to file lawsuits alleging false claims. As a reward, a whistle-blower can receive up to 30 percent of any amounts recovered, with the balance going to the Treasury.In the three decades since adoption of that law, championed by Mr. Grassley, the government has recovered more than $59 billion. Last year, for example, the Justice Department obtained more than $2.8 billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government. Of that amount, $2.5 billion came from the health care industry, including drug and medical device manufacturers, hospitals, doctors and home health care companies.Mr. Barr’s opposition to the law continued after he left the Justice Department.The Supreme Court upheld the whistle-blower provisions of the law in 2000, in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. But a year later, in an interview for an oral history of the presidency of George H.W. Bush, Mr. Barr described the whistle-blower law as “an abomination” and repeated some of the objections raised in his 1989 opinion.Mr. Barr argued that the whistle-blower law was unconstitutional for several reasons: It violates a provision of the Constitution specifying how federal officials are to be appointed. Whistle-blowers have not personally suffered an injury and therefore do not have a right, or standing, to be in court. And the law violates the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers among the three branches of government.Mr. Barr said he was particularly upset because, under the law, whistle-blowers could second-guess the attorney general, challenging litigation decisions by the government and its efforts to dismiss or settle a case.Lawyers for whistle-blowers said Mr. Barr fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of the False Claims Act and the 1986 amendments, adopted to address widespread fraud by federal contractors.“For more than three decades, the False Claims Act has served the Department of Justice and the American taxpayer extraordinarily well,” said Robert Patten, the president and chief executive of Taxpayers Against Fraud, a nonprofit group that supports the law. In a letter to members of the Judiciary Committee, he urged them to pin down Mr. Barr’s current views of the law.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Candidate Will Be Pushed to Renounce Opposition to Whistle-Blower Law.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Cash-strapped government workers
are worried about buying food and making rent. Trash and human feces (seriously!) are piling up in national parks. Even the Secret Service is feeling stressed.And yet, 19 days into what’s become the country’s second-longest government shutdown, there’s no compromise in sight, and no additional negotiations scheduled.The problem, of course, is politics. The shutdown hinges on a border wall battle that’s become about so much more than a wall. In many ways, President Trump’s fight for his “big, beautiful wall” is a metaphor for the current politics of Washington.You have a broadly unpopular Republican president, already operating under a cloud of investigations, obsessed with keeping his promises to his supporters ahead of what’s expected to be a tough re-election race. And you have a Democratic opposition equally driven by their voters to oppose him at every turn.Those politics are the undercurrent for all the talks about the shutdown, and they’re fundamentally at odds with each other. And each sides sees political benefit to holding out and resisting any sort of compromise.Here’s what Democrats see:• Midterm wins. Democrats won control of the House despite efforts by the president to turn the final weeks of the campaign into a referendum on undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump couldn’t get his wall funded when he controlled both houses of Congress. Why should they give now, Democrats argue, if his own party wouldn’t?• The base. Yes, some Democrats have backed border fencing in the past. But Mr. Trump’s hard-line policies, which Democrats see as racist and xenophobic, have pushed the party to the left. And it’s harder to cut deals when the debate becomes about morality.• The dealmaker has no clothes. Storming out a meeting after saying “bye-bye” isn’t a good look for any president, Democrats believe, but particularly one who ran on his ability to negotiate. The broader impact of the shutdown cuts through the theatrics the president typically uses to get out of tricky situations.• Jumpy Republicans. On Wednesday night, eight House Republicans broke with the president and voted for a Democratic bill that would reopen the Treasury Department. At least four G.O.P. Senators have expressed some support for reopening the government. The most jittery of all? Republicans up for re-election in purple states.What the White House sees:• The other base. Mr. Trump measures his political success by whether he keeps his supporters happy. That’s part of why he rejected a deal on the shutdown negotiated by his own aides and G.O.P. leaders after conservatives voiced opposition. And his base wants that wall.• Mueller? Mueller? The constant focus on the shutdown provides Mr. Trump and the White House with a break from the story line that really makes them nervous: the special counsel investigation.What Republicans see: • Opposition to Mr. Trump never pays. There are 19 Senate Republicans up for re-election next year in red states. A lesson many took away from the president’s support of primary challengers during 2018 midterms was that Republican establishment doesn’t win by contradicting Mr. Trump.• A longer timeline. The decisions by the White House to pay out food stamps through February and process tax refunds means Republicans have a bit more breathing room. Particularly in poorer districts, extending these programs provides essential cash infusions to large parts of their voting base.• The elusive deal. Senate Republicans have grown increasingly aggravated with the lack of clarity from the White House, leaving them unsure about whether Mr. Trump would even sign a deal they managed to cut with Democrats. That’s part of why the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has kept his distance from the talks. “It’s always difficult,” Senator John Cornyn told The Washington Post, “when the person you’re negotiating with is someone who changes his mind.”But don’t forget this:Elections are not won or lost on shutdowns.In 1995 and 1996, Americans blamed the Republican Congress for shutdowns. The party held onto its majorities in the 1996 election. In 2013, Americans once again blamed Republicans for the shutdown. In the midterms that followed the next year, the party gained seats in the House and won back the Senate.Have you been personally affected by the shutdown? Tell us about it: OnPolitics@nytimes.com.

We decided to check in with Linda Qiu, The Times’s fact checker, and test the veracity of some of the president’s recent talk about the border.Lisa: In his prime-time address on Tuesday, the president said the southern border was at a crisis point. What do you make of that? Have things gotten considerably worse down there? Linda: Mr. Trump said the word “crisis” six times in that nine-minute address! But there’s not really a good case for a border crisis. Illegal border crossings have been declining for about two decades. I’ll bore you with some numbers now: From the 1980s to mid-2000s, apprehensions at the southwest border were between 1 million and 1.6 million annually. Last year, the number was just under 400,000. Now, there has been an uptick in monthly crossings in October and November, to about 50,000 apprehensions each month. But compare that to 2000, when the monthly number was between 70,000 and 220,000.It’s also interesting to me that Mr. Trump has sort of stopped trying to use data to support his arguments. Instead, he’s talking more about “Angel Families” — people whose loved ones were killed by undocumented immigrants — as he did in the speech on Tuesday night and during a round-table today. (And some of these families really appreciate the president advocating on their behalf!) But certainly, it’s more beneficial for him to highlight these specific tragedies than talk about the body of research that shows that immigration does not lead to more crime, and that immigrants are actually less like to commit crimes than native-born Americans.So at the end of the day, it’s an emotional appeal, rather than a statistical or empirical argument about any “crisis.”Lisa: The appeal to emotions reminds me of the migrant caravan, which the president helped turn into a national story ahead of the midterm elections. What happened to the caravan? Did the migrants ever come to the U.S.?Linda: Some migrants certainly did try. Remember that televised clash in late November? Hundreds of migrants attempted to run toward a border crossing in San Diego, and Customs and Border Protection closed the border and fired tear gas into the crowd. Our colleagues who have been traveling with the caravan also reported in December that about 2,000 have made appointments with immigration officials to petition for asylum — which is perfectly legal — and they’re facing long waiting times. A lot of migrants have also decided to just stay in Mexico for the time being. And some have attempted to cross the border illegally.Now that Washington is at an impasse over the president’s border wall, Mr. Trump has been talking caravans again. This time he’s warning of a new caravan forming in Honduras. And I imagine this won’t be the last time we hear him talking ominously about groups of migrants coming to the southern border.For more, check out Linda’s Fact-Check of the Day.

The message: She’s a unifier in a time of deep polarization and division.“We’re at an inflection moment, not only in the history of our country but the history of our world,” Ms. Harris said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “There are a lot of people who rightly feel displaced. They are wondering: Where do they belong? Are they relevant? Are they seen? Are we thinking about them?”“We need leadership has a vision of the future in which everyone can see themselves,” she said.Though Ms. Harris is expected to announce her presidential candidacy in the coming weeks, a source close to the senator said there’s no imminent plans on when that will happen. Ms. Harris will be in New York City Friday, for a book event at the famed 92nd Street Y on the Upper East Side.This week she also tweeted a call for nationalized legal marijuana and said incarcerated persons who were convicted on nonviolent marijuana-related charges should have their records expunged.Ms. Harris has, at times, come under fire from social justice activists who say her tenure as California attorney general did not match her progressive rhetoric. It is one of several challenges facing Ms. Harris’s candidacy, which will be one of the first viable campaigns for president launched by a nonwhite woman.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________What to read tonight• Scientists have found that the oceans are heating up 40 percent faster than a U.N. panel estimated five years ago, and that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.• Video games as a varsity sport?

But there’s a stronger case for waiting for the 2020 election.By Michael TomaskyContributing Opinion WriterJan. 13, 2019ImageThe White House as President Trump prepared to address the nation from the Oval Office about border security last week.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesLast weekend, a smart friend of mine raised an interesting question: Would political opponents of Donald Trump rather see him removed from office via impeachment and conviction, or would we rather see him voted out of office in 2020?The question has the makings of a parlor game that could occupy the passions of anti-Trump Americans for months. Strong cases can be made for both sides of the argument. I come down on the side of the ballot box, and firmly so, because it has more historical authority and legitimacy — and for one other reason that I’ll reveal in a bit.The impeachment side of the argument, though, isn’t to be dismissed out of hand. It’s true that impeachment is a political process, and getting enough Republicans to support removing a president from their party would take a formidable list of offenses. But to a lot of us, the list is already quite formidable — Mr. Trump has, by any common-sense definition, obstructed justice repeatedly in public. Many House Democrats are raring to go with what they have; Representative Brad Sherman of California has already introduced his own articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.And there is likely to be much more. For the moment, let’s presume that several months from now, Robert Mueller has given us evidence of obstruction, cooperation with Russians during the 2016 campaign and compelling evidence that Russian banks on some level “own” Mr. Trump. And that’s leaving aside everything investigators may be learning about the Trump Organization from Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg.Let’s also assume that House Democrats will have done their work and, at a minimum, documented numerous and ghastly Trump family violations of the emoluments clause. Remember also on that front that two lawsuits are working their way through the federal courts, so let’s imagine that they are allowed to proceed as well. This is to say nothing of the instances of more banal forms of corruption Democrats may have unearthed through their own investigations this year that could rightly be called high crimes and misdemeanors. In sum, let us say that by next football season, the president’s goose will be well and truly cooked, and House impeachment proceedings seem amply justified.There will then hang the question of whether 20 Senate Republicans — at least, assuming that all 47 Democrats would vote to convict — would actually agree to remove Mr. Trump from office. That seems exceedingly unlikely.But whether they would or would not, many would argue that Democrats would still have a constitutional responsibility to exercise. Impeachment is the only remedy the founders provided for removing from office someone who is clearly unfit to hold it. If all of what I stipulated above happens and the Democrats don’t act, aren’t they saying the Constitution is meaningless? If you can’t impeach a president whose very election is found to have been illegitimate, then whom can you impeach? And how do you recover, as a country, from such a bitterly partisan episode? Those are good questions. But they have an obvious answer. While impeachment is clearly a valid exercise of power, so is another method of removal, also prescribed by the Constitution: an election. This is how Americans like to ditch presidents and parties they don’t like — presidential power has changed hands 44 times in this country’s history.In addition, nine incumbent presidents have lost re-election, including three in the last half-century, and all have peacefully (if not always gracefully) yielded power. In contrast, only two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, have been impeached by the House, though both were acquitted in the Senate. Richard Nixon, facing certain and imminent impeachment, resigned.That’s a historical record that suggests that an electoral outcome will be much more widely accepted. Mr. Trump’s partisans will whine about the unfairness of it all in either case — they’ll blame “voter fraud,” or George Soros, or the “fake news media.” But if the voters have rebuffed the president, the whining will sound to most Americans like just that.There’s one more reason I’d prefer to see Mr. Trump laid low via the ballot. It will do more long-term damage to the Republican Party.If Mr. Trump is removed via impeachment and conviction — that is, with those 20 Republican votes — Republicans can say, “See, we’ve come to our senses; got that out of our system.” But if they renominate Mr. Trump and stick with him through November 2020 and the voters clearly say no, not again, Republicans are left sitting in the wreckage. They will be trying to air out the Trump stench for a generation, maybe two, which is precisely the fate they deserve.True, this carries the risk that Mr. Trump might win in 2020. But the impeachment process carries the (considerable) risk that a Senate conviction will fall short, which would enable Mr. Trump to seek re-election as the victim of those vicious Democrats and of the enemy of the people, the press. Nothing in life is risk free.But risk’s opposite is reward, and in this case the far greater reward — for liberals and Democrats, yes, but also for our democracy itself — is the one that would come on the night of Nov. 3, 2020, when perhaps a record number of voters will cast their ballots and a decisive majority will say to Mr. Trump: Go home.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Michael Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast, editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas and a contributing opinion writer.

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The partial government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, making it the longest in American history.Privately, many Republicans say the stalemate over the border wall has been made exponentially worse by White House ineptitude on Capitol Hill. On Friday, the president stepped back from declaring a national emergency under pressure from congressional Republicans, but there is still no end in sight.On Tuesday night, President Trump used his first prime-time Oval Office address — one that was filled with misleading assertions — to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall.A day after storming out of a meeting in the White House with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump traveled to the southern border on Thursday to bolster his case for a wall, and he canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.As effects of the shutdown pile up, more Americans are feeling the bite. The nation’s air travel system could be at risk; farmers that stood with Mr. Trump during the election are at a breaking point; and 800,000 federal employees still haven’t received a paycheck.Additional Reading•

A formatting error by Paul Manafort’s lawyer revealed that Mr. Manafort, a former manager of the Trump campaign, shared polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.House Democrats summoned Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a classified briefing about the government’s plans to end sanctions on companies linked to a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Mnuchin told lawmakers that the White House played no formal role in the decision, and he said later that he would consider delaying the lifting of the sanctions so skeptics in Congress could have more time to review it.Additional Reading• Prosecutors Examining Ukrainians Who Flocked to Trump Inaugural•

Mr. Bolton — who found himself scrambling after Mr. Trump’s announcement — is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to the president’s sudden move.The president’s withdrawal plan fell into further disarray on Tuesday after Turkey’s leader rebuffed Mr. Bolton, angrily dismissing his demand that Turkey agree to protect America’s Kurdish allies.Regardless of the turmoil, the American military began withdrawing some equipment (but no troops yet) from Syria on Friday.Additional Reading• Pompeo Speech Lays Out Vision for Mideast, Taking Shots at Obama• Trump and Pompeo Embrace Autocrats and Disparage Opponents at Home•

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|If Trump Were a Fictional Character ...AdvertisementOpinionSupported bylettersIf Trump Were a Fictional Character ...Readers, inspired by a Bret Stephens column, offer their own ideas, turning to Sinclair Lewis, Cervantes, Voltaire and others. Jan. 19, 2019Image CreditCreditScott MenchinTo the Editor:Re “When Fiction Most Becomes Trump” (column, Dec. 28):Bret Stephens cleverly analyzes how Shakespeare might tell the improbable tale of Donald Trump as both comedy and tragedy. Mr. Stephens compares Mr. Trump to Falstaff, although Mr. Trump and his caustic tweets hardly compare to Falstaff’s insults hurled toward Prince Hal: “you starveling, you elfskin, you dried neat’s tongue, you bull’s pizzle, you stockfish! ... You tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile standing tuck.”Image CreditScott MenchinIn his tragic examples, Mr. Stephens could have mentioned King Lear, who through the fog of his dementia still fancies himself “every inch a king.” One hopes that Mr. Trump will not descend into King Lear-ean madness, although one does wonder which acting cabinet chief will respond if King Donald asks, “Who is it that can tell me who I am?”Methinks we’ll know that we’re in the final act of this tragedy when King Donald tweets about filial ingratitude. But will he throw his own children under the bus? That is the question.Eileen DeboldPiscataway, N.J. Image CreditScott MenchinTo the Editor:Bret Stephens is right that the greatest writers throughout history could have featured Donald Trump as a villain in their works. One novelist who brought to life a fictional demagogue was Sinclair Lewis, the first American recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. In his 1935 tale of a dictatorship in America, “It Can’t Happen Here,” Lewis imagined America under the iron heel of an authoritarian president named Buzz Windrip, a homegrown fascist who rallies his base with bellicose speeches, soaring promises and shifting facts.Windrip and his supporters are challenged by a small-town newspaper editor, Doremus Jessup, who speaks words in fiction that still are relevant in fact today: “Where in all history has there ever been a people so ripe for a dictatorship as ours!”If Sinclair Lewis were alive today, he would find plenty of material in Mr. Trump and the people who continue to support his presidency.Ed TantAthens, Ga.To the Editor:In his short satirical tale “Zadig, or the Book of Fate,” Voltaire describes the fictitious great lord Irax: “The peacocks are not more vain, the doves not more voluptuous.” He is, we are told, “corrupted by vanity and voluptuousness” and “breathed nothing but false glory and false pleasures.” Zadig, the prime minister of the kingdom, undertakes to rectify the bad behavior. He does this with the cooperation of a vast entourage of the court’s sycophants and via such an uninterrupted litany of praise for Irax for all the good qualities he lacked, that after five days Irax, exhausted and chastened, begged for it to stop.President Trump does not appear to be exhausted or chastened.Jerry KavanaghPearl River, N.Y.To the Editor:In a time when the classics are nearly all forgotten by the average reader, I was heartened to read Bret Stephens’s imaginative column about how the classic writers might have portrayed Donald Trump and his minions. Missing, however, was the wonderful “Don Quixote,” by Cervantes. Written at the turn of the 17th century, “Don Quixote” conjures a character who can only be seen as a premonition of the leadership we live with today. It is the story of a man who thinks he is something he is not and who cannot tell the difference between reality and illusion. When confronted with the evidence of his illusions, he simply dismisses the reality as enchantments. While Don Quixote the character lacks the malevolence of Donald Trump the president, his misstatements and actions still cause embarrassment to himself (that he does not recognize) and sometimes tragedy for others. Cervantes wrote of Don Quixote, “He accommodated every thing he saw, with incredible facility, to the extravagant ravings of his disordered judgment.”If that doesn’t sound like Donald Trump, I don’t know what does!Jeffrey E. GreenSomerville, Mass.ImageCreditScott MenchinTo the Editor:Shakespearean comedy captures the unremitting follies of Donald Trump’s presidency at least as well the histories and tragedies that Bret Stephens cites. The virtuosically awful play-within-the-play staged by the “mechanicals” in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is especially apt.It features a redundancy-prone character named Wall and a fumbling cast that can’t keep its lines straight. Center stage is Bottom, who so craves attention that he tries to play all the parts, overplays his own outrageously, and doesn’t even notice when (in a prank by meddling fairies) his human head is replaced by that of an ass. Watching the performance bemusedly is Duke Theseus (Robert Mueller?).In the Bard’s words: “Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall, / Show me thy chink[!].” Jamie FumoTallahassee, Fla.The writer is a professor of English at Florida State University.To the Editor:Bret Stephens’s discussion of fictional analogies to President Trump unfortunately omits perhaps the most prescient and powerful example: Alfred Jarry’s proto-Absurdist, scatological farce “King Ubu.” Jarry’s 1896 satire of absolute power combined with absolute greed is the perfect mirror for our own Trumpian age. Ubu is a petulant, overgrown child craving attention and satisfaction of his appetites at any cost. Accompanied by his unscrupulous queen, Ubu combines primeval innocence and terrifying brutality, destroying followers and suspected rivals with equal alacrity. He is a cartoon villain come to life, devoid of psychological complexity and rational thought, his humanity reduced to a series of urges, appetites and desires. Jarry’s subversiveness has long been hailed as a brilliant precursor to the Theater of the Absurd, in which logic was rendered meaningless on stage. It is time now to understand the play as a precursor to our increasingly dangerous times, in which order and reason have been gleefully breached in the name of absolute, unbridled power and obsessive greed.Henry I.

Putin of Russia spoke with President Trump at a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, in July.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBy Noah WeilandJan. 21, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump boasted recently that he has been “FAR tougher” on Russia than other American presidents. But while the Trump administration has cracked down on Russian diplomats, government officials and oligarchs, Mr. Trump himself largely has taken a far more generous stance toward Moscow.The contradiction has taken on new meaning in light of several recent reports, including one on an F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation that was opened in 2017 into whether Mr. Trump had secretly acted on Russia’s behalf — one facet of the Justice Department’s investigation into Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Here are five key ways in which Mr. Trump has been at odds with his own administration over Russia in the past year.Pulling troops out of Syria and AfghanistanMr. Trump’s go-it-alone decision in December to pull 2,000 American troops from Syria set up a dramatic clash with top officials in his administration and prompted protest resignations by Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State.Just weeks later, the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, directly contradicted Mr. Trump’s proposed timeline, putting conditions on the withdrawal of forces and suggesting a significant delay.The president’s order also drew concern and criticism from some of Mr. Trump’s supporters, including Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey over the weekend and called for a slower withdrawal to avoid setting off a broader war.Also in December, Mr. Trump announced the removal of 7,000 troops from Afghanistan, an abrupt decision that stunned American and Afghan officials.A mild response to Russia’s seizing of Ukrainian shipsWhen Russian forces took 24 Ukrainian sailors captive late last year, senior officials in the Trump administration gave the president options for responding. They included new sanctions or increasing NATO’s naval presence in the Black Sea. But Mr. Trump has not yet taken action, even as administration officials insist options are still being considered and as Europe coordinates a response.In November, responding to the standoff, Mr. Trump canceled a meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a forum of the Group of 20 industrialized economies. At a dinner on the sidelines of the meeting, however, Mr. Trump told Mr. Putin that a resolution was needed. Yet he has sought to blame both sides in the conflict, saying merely that he did not “like what is happening.”Russia has extended the detention of the sailors and demanded a trial on charges of border violations.Reluctantly imposing expulsions and sanctionsPrivately, Mr. Trump was irritated by his administration’s response to the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy living in England that the British authorities have said was carried out by Russian agents. He was initially upset that 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers were expelled from the United States in response to the attack, given that European nations were not expelling the same number.Later, Mr. Trump opted against new sanctions against Russia for its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria after a chemical attack near Damascus that killed more than 40 people. Mr. Trump believed the sanctions, which had been announced by Nikki R. Haley, then the United Nations ambassador, were unnecessary in light of a missile strike against Syrian targets.And when the Trump administration began imposing a series of sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations in retaliation for cyberattacks and interference in the 2016 election, the president appeared out of line with his own cabinet.In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
overstated the Trump administration’s push for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which the president signed into law in 2017 after it passed the Senate with a veto-proof majority. Mr. Trump approved it only hesitantly, first attempting to weaken it and criticizing it as “seriously flawed.”Deflecting accusations of interference in the 2016 and 2018 electionsDuring a news conference in July in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. His comments — with Mr. Putin at his side — generated a sharp backlash from Mr. Trump’s aides and congressional allies.Those tensions flared again this month after The Washington Post and others reported that Mr. Trump attempted to hide notes from one of his meetings with Mr. Putin in 2017 from his own advisers.Since then, the president has largely stopped expressing public confidence in Mr. Putin. Yet Mr. Trump has continued to downplay Russia’s election interference, even as the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has repeatedly showed how extensive it was.In October, the Justice Department brought its first charges against Russia for interfering in the 2018 midterm elections, releasing a joint statement from several of Mr. Trump’s top cabinet officials decrying the attempts. Mr. Trump, however, was mostly silent on the indictment, and instead sought to paint himself as a protector of elections while also blaming the Obama administration for keeping quiet about election meddling during the 2016 presidential campaign.Defense of the NATO allianceSenior administration officials have told The New York Times that Mr. Trump has privately, and repeatedly, said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which would buttress Mr. Putin’s eagerness to weaken the group.Mr. Trump, countering the formal position of his administration, has railed against NATO. He has said that the alliance was “going out of business,” and that its member nations were not paying their fair share of costs. After visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels in July, Mr. Trump claimed inaccurately that NATO spending was increasing “because of me,” misrepresenting how the alliance functions.Other administration officials, particularly in the military, are continuing to strengthen ties with NATO allies. Over the weekend, the United States Navy sent an American destroyer to the Black Sea, a move that Russia quickly denounced.

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________No end in sight for the shutdown.In its fourth week, the government shutdown has cascaded across generations, from children worried about their parents to college students unable to pay tuition to federal workers filing for unemployment. It’s also beginning to affect federal court funding and criminal justice reform.But as the effects spread, Washington is still at a stalemate. President Trump rejected a proposal from the Republican senator Lindsey Graham on Monday to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start negotiations with Democrats. Democrats, in turn, rejected an invite from Mr. Trump on Tuesday to discuss the shutdown over lunch at the White House.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asked Mr. Trump on Wednesday to scrap or delay his State of the Union address, citing security and logistical concerns stemming from the shutdown. Mr. Trump retaliated on Thursday by grounding the military plane that was going to take the speaker and other lawmakers to Afghanistan, a trip he called a “public relations event.” Ms. Pelosi ultimately postponed her plans, saying that Mr. Trump’s announcement “had significantly increased the danger” of the trip.Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps federal workers shouldn’t show up to work at all; House Democrats are contemplating a homeland security spending measure with their own ideas for securing the border; and Mr. Trump is growing increasingly anxious.Additional Reading• Shutdown’s Economic Damage Starts to Pile Up, Threatening an End to Growth• Republicans Are in Lock Step With Trump on Shutdown. But for How Long?• Trump’s Wall Stance Upends Washington’s Usual Border BargainingMore on Trump and Russia.Last weekend, a Fox News host asked Mr. Trump whether he was a Russian agent, and the president didn’t give a direct answer. (He later said that he wasn’t.) This week, it emerged that Mr. Trump has repeatedly withheld details of his conversations with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, from his own aides, even taking notes from an interpreter who attended one of their meetings.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has insisted that there was “no collusion” with Russia during his 2016 campaign. But on each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship.Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, backtracked on Thursday from earlier remarks in which he seemed to leave open the possibility that Trump campaign aides had coordinated with Russia in its election interference.After Mr. Trump made cryptic comments about his former attorney Michael Cohen, top Democrats in Congress warned Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness’s testimony could be construed as a crime. On Friday, BuzzFeed News reported that Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow. But the special counsel’s office disputed the report.Additional Reading• Michael Cohen Acknowledges Payments for Poll Rigging•

The punishment came after Mr. King, who has a long history of racist remarks, made comments to The Times last week questioning why white supremacy was considered offensive.On Tuesday, Republicans began pushing Mr. King toward the exit and created a super PAC aimed at unseating him in 2020. The House also voted nearly unanimously to endorse a resolution that rejected white nationalism and white supremacy as “hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.”Many Iowa voters still like Mr. King, our reporter found, despite his open defense of white supremacy. But they also recognize that his career is effectively over.Additional Reading• A Timeline of Steve King’s Racist Remarks and Divisive Actions•

Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, discussed internal polling data from the 2016 race with a man tied to Russian intelligence, prosecutors alleged.The accusations came to light in a document filed by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers that was supposed to be partly blacked out — but contained a formatting error. Above, Mr. Manafort after a court appearance last year.Prosecutors for the special counsel Robert Mueller broke off a plea agreement with Mr. Manafort in November, accusing him of repeatedly lying to them. The details of their accusations have been largely kept secret until now.Separately, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, was charged in a separate case showing her Kremlin ties. Prosecutors said she helped draft Russia’s “intentionally misleading” response in a fraud case._____ImageCreditTurkish Presidential Press Service, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images4. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey refused to meet with John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, after he said Turkey must agree to protect Syria’s Kurds.The snub came a day after Mr. Erdogan commended President Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria. It makes an agreement between the two allies that much more difficult ahead of an announced U.S. withdrawal from Syria. Above, Mr. Bolton, left, with a Turkish government spokesman.For his part, Mr. Bolton has been walking a tricky line on the withdrawal plans. He walked back Mr. Trump’s promises for a speedy removal of 2,000 troops — but he was also at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to that sudden move in the first place._____ImageCreditLuke Sharrett for The New York Times5. U.S. carbon dioxide output rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate by a private research group.The uptick came even as a near-record number of coal plants across the country closed last year. Some of that increase was weather related, but another big reason for the change was the growing economy: Emissions from factories, planes and trucks soared.The report illustrates how difficult it could be for the country to make further progress on climate change, particularly as the Trump administration pushes to roll back federal regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions._____ImageCreditMike Segar/Reuters6.

Veselnitskaya was charged on Tuesday with seeking to thwart a Justice Department investigation into money laundering.CreditCreditYury Martyanov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Benjamin Weiser and Sharon LaFraniereJan. 8, 2019[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who in 2016 met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower, was charged on Tuesday in a separate case that showed her close ties to the Kremlin.Ms. Veselnitskaya, a pivotal figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, was charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with seeking to thwart an earlier investigation into money laundering that involved an influential Russian businessman and his investment firm.The money-laundering case was not directly related to the Trump Tower meeting. But a federal indictment returned in Manhattan seemed to confirm that Ms. Veselnitskaya had deep ties to senior Russian government officials and rekindled questions about whether the Kremlin tried to use her as an intermediary to Donald J. Trump’s campaign.The charge stems from a 2013 civil investigation by the Manhattan prosecutors into the role that some of Ms. Veselnitskaya’s clients — Prevezon Holdings and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv — played in a scheme to launder ill-gotten money through New York real estate purchases.The Justice Department asked the Russian government to assist its investigation, but the Russians refused, responding with a document that purported to exonerate Russian officials and Prevezon, according to the indictment.The indictment said Ms. Veselnitskaya secretly cooperated with a senior Russian prosecutor in drafting the document, which was later filed in federal court in Manhattan.She is charged with one count of obstruction of justice.Ms. Veselnitskaya, 43, is believed to be in Russia, according to the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which moved to unseal the indictment on Tuesday. The office gave no indication that it expected her to be sent to Manhattan to face charges.Ms. Veselnitskaya did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. CNN quoted her as saying she had just learned of the indictment and would defend her “professional honor.”The new indictment again raised questions about whom Ms. Veselnitskaya was representing when she met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and others at Trump Tower in Manhattan.That meeting is one focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia’s covert operation to sway the presidential race. It was organized after an intermediary promised that Ms. Veselnitskaya would deliver documents that would incriminate Hillary Clinton.Last April, Ms. Veselnitskaya acknowledged in an interview with NBC News that she was not merely a private lawyer, but a source of information for the Russian prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika. Now, prosecutors in Manhattan say she collaborated clandestinely with that office to write an official letter that benefited Prevezon.For years, Ms. Veselnitskaya has been regarded as a trusted insider and go-to lawyer for the Moscow regional government.Read the Indictment: United States vs. Natalia V. VeselnitskayaMs. Veselnitskaya had secretly cooperated with a Russian prosecutor in drafting the Russian response in a United States money-laundering case, the document says.

[Learn why Natalia Veselnitskaya is seen as a fearsome Moscow insider.]In the fraud case, filed in 2013, the Manhattan prosecutors accused Prevezon and other defendants of using real estate purchases in New York to launder a small portion of the proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax scheme. The lawsuit was settled last May on the eve of trial for about $6 million, with Prevezon admitting no fault.The Russian fraud had been uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, the Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after exposing the scheme and who died in a Moscow jail.Ms. Veselnitskaya has maintained that she was acting in a private capacity when she visited Trump Tower in June 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination.Her claim has been undercut by revelations that the meeting was organized because campaign officials had been told she could offer damaging information about Ms. Clinton from the Russian government.In addition,
her memo on talking points for the meeting
closely matched a memo Mr. Chaika’s office had prepared for an American member of Congress, incorporating some passages verbatim.The indictment unsealed on Tuesday could further undermine Ms. Veselnitskaya’s story, alleging that a year before the Trump Tower get-together she worked hand in glove with Russian officials to derail the money-laundering case.In that case, the Manhattan prosecutors alleged that corrupt Russian officials stole the corporate identities of companies owned by Hermitage Capital Management, a foreign investment firm operating in Russia, and used them to fraudulently claim $230 million in tax refunds.As part of the investigation, the Justice Department asked the Russian government in 2014 for assistance in obtaining bank records and other materials pertaining to the fraud scheme, the indictment said.In response, the Russians provided the supposed findings of an investigation that “purported to exonerate all Russian government personnel” and instead cast blame on the London-based chief executive of Hermitage, William F. Browder; his lawyer, Mr. Magnitsky; and others, the indictment said.In 2015, lawyers representing Prevezon, which had been accused of laundering some of the fraudulent proceeds, filed court papers, including the declaration from Ms. Veselnitskaya, to argue that the Russian government’s findings were exculpatory evidence. The papers did not disclose her role, the indictment charged.The indictment said Ms. Veselnitskaya exchanged emails with a senior Russian prosecutor, attaching drafts with edits and comments. Many of her suggestions “were adopted, either essentially verbatim, in rephrased form or with light edits,” it said.The Russian prosecutor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said on Tuesday that “fabricating evidence” in an attempt “to affect the outcome of pending litigation not only undermines the integrity of the judicial process, but it threatens the ability of our courts and our government to ensure that justice is done.”Mr. Browder has led a human-rights campaign against the Kremlin that has resulted in sanctions being imposed against Russian officials worldwide. He said on Tuesday that Ms. Veselnitskaya came to the United States to “disrupt the political process by lying about me and lying about Sergei Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer. And she got caught lying, and she’s being prosecuted for those lies.”Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Riga, Latvia.

The government shutdown is now the longest in history.At midnight on Saturday, the partial shutdown reached 22 days, surpassing the previous record of 21 under the Clinton administration in 1995.President Trump, above, used an Oval Office address and a visit to Texas to push for his long-promised border wall, the central issue of the shutdown. Under pressure from his own party and advisers, the president has backed away from declaring a national emergency to pay for the wall.His aides said they expected the stalemate to be resolved by the time Mr. Trump delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29.Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles.____ImageCreditMichael B. Thomas for The New York Times2. The shutdown’s day-to-day impact on Americans — even those who work for the government — varies radically from workplace to workplace, or even from colleague to colleague. Above, a protest outside the Federal Center in St. Louis.At one research institute in Colorado, for example, some people are employed directly by the federal government and cannot work or be paid, while others are paid by the University of Colorado, Boulder, but are locked out of their federal offices. For a third group that hasn’t been affected, the institute’s director said, it’s: “Shutdown? What shutdown? I am not feeling anything.”Some states are also feeling the impact more than others. We broke down how federal workers in every state are affected.____ImageCreditTom Brenner for The New York Times3. Days after President Trump fired James B. Comey, above center, as F.B.I. director in May 2017, the bureau opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests — either knowingly or unwittingly.That inquiry is now under the purview of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, though it’s unclear whether he is still pursuing the matter.On Tuesday, lawyers for Paul Manafort, who was a top official in Mr. Trump’s campaign, accidentally disclosed that Mr. Manafort had shared polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence. “This is the closest thing we have seen to collusion,” said a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The question now is, did the president know about it?”____ImageCreditMauricio Lima for The New York Times4. The American military has begun withdrawing equipment — but not troops — from Syria. Above, an outpost on the edges of Manbij.There is confusion over President Trump’s plans to wind down U.S. involvement in the conflict: Last month, officials said the president intended to pull out American troops within 30 days, but more recently, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the pullout was conditional and American forces could remain in Syria for months or even years.And despite those plans, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a speech in Cairo on Thursday that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East.____ImageCreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times5.

Increasing ocean temperatures kill off marine ecosystems, raise sea levels and make hurricanes more destructive.Now scientists say the world’s oceans are warming far more quickly than previously thought, and as temperatures continue to rise, those effects will become more catastrophic.For its part, America’s carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate released Tuesday. It seems that a steep drop in coal use wasn’t enough to offset rising emissions in other parts of the economy.____ImageCreditJerry Holt/Star Tribune, via Associated Press7.

HenningJan. 7, 2019Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________One year ago, Bitcoin was minting millionaires as its value surged to nearly $20,000. Now it is worth about $4,000, and many wonder whether it can survive as a viable investment option, regardless of whether it will ever supplant currencies.In 2018, the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III kept expanding. With the Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, a raft of investigations of the Trump administration is sure to follow.The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. Here are some thoughts on topics that should continue to be of interest in 2019:Will Goldman Fight the Government Over 1MDB?After the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs sought to expand into Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, that effort was caught up in a scandal at an investment fund in Malaysia.Goldman raised more than $6 billion for that fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The money was supposed to benefit the Malaysian public but ended up enriching Goldman and those close to Najib Razak, who was prime minister. In December, the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the firm of violating securities laws there.Those charges come on top of a Justice Department investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars corporations from bribing foreign officials to gain a business advantage. Goldman’s former top banker in Asia, Timothy Leissner, pleaded guilty in August, describing his role in concealing bribes and kickbacks. Charges were also filed against Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner’s former deputy, who is being held in Malaysia pending extradition.The firm initially tried to shake off the charges by claiming that any misconduct was the work of a few rogue employees, but reports that Goldman’s former chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein met with a key figure in the fraud have undercut that defense.Goldman’s chief executive, David M. Solomon, has offered a full-throated defense of the firm. In a message to employees, he wrote: “We believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today.”An American corporation can be prosecuted for the acts of its employees, so Goldman does not have many defenses if prosecutors decide to file charges.Although Goldman has pledged its cooperation, the firm has also claimed that it is innocent of the Malaysian charges and may well be girding for a fight with the Justice Department to limit its liability. Goldman also will have to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, and the Federal Reserve, Goldman’s chief banking regulator.Goldman has little choice but to reach a settlement. The key question is how much its entanglement with 1MDB may cost the firm. Disgorging the $600 million fee it earned for arranging the bond deals is the likely starting point for any resolution in the United States.How much a potential fine could be on top of that is anyone’s guess. One possibility is that it will be a multiple of Goldman’s profit on the transaction. That could push the penalty over a billion dollars, with the possibility of even more if Goldman has to reach an agreement with the Malaysian government.Do Cryptocurrencies Need a New Regulator?The precipitous fall in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2016 cries out for greater regulation to protect investors. Studies have shown that the market for cryptocurrencies is subject to widespread manipulation, which puts smaller investors at the mercy of those who are trying to profit from the price swings.Two bills were introduced in Congress in December to address manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Neither offers a concrete step toward regulating trading platforms, nor do they designate oversight to a single agency.As investors have suffered losses, the questions have increased about whether cryptocurrencies will survive as a viable investment class. Without greater government oversight to curb manipulation, the interest of small investors may well dry up.The Coming InvestigationsControl of the House means Democrats can investigate actions by the Trump administration, and perhaps the president himself. The subpoenas for documents and testimony are likely to fly up Pennsylvania Avenue in much the way they did during the Obama administration after Republicans took control of Congress.But those hoping for a cascade of materials from the Trump administration may be disappointed. Congressional investigations may well run into claims of executive privilege, something previous administrations have used to resist demands for information. That means any dispute of what must be produced will be decided in the federal courts under the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Nixon, the Watergate case that found the judiciary has final authority to determine the scope of any claim of privilege.That is not a very expeditious route for a congressional committee to pursue. Any decision is likely to take months. Add to that the likelihood of an appeal, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, and it may take two or more years to adjudicate a privilege claim.Corporate DisclosureIn August, President Trump tweeted that he wanted the S.E.C. to change the requirements for companies to issue financial statements from each quarter to twice a year. Publicly traded companies complain that the quarterly reporting requirement feeds into the short-term mentality of the securities markets.The S.E.C. issued a request for comments on Dec. 18 about “the nature, content and timing of earnings releases and quarterly reports.” Asking for comments is a sure way to slow-walk any potential changes.Reuters reported that some Republicans are frustrated that Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has not pushed a deregulatory agenda as aggressively as expected and sided with the two Democrats on the commission with some regularity. Could dissatisfaction with Mr. Clayton cause Congress to take the lead on making major changes to the reporting obligations of companies?Larger companies are unlikely to see any significant alteration of their quarterly reporting obligations, but smaller companies — which have a broad appeal on Capitol Hill — may see a change in the frequency and scope of their reporting.The question is whether that will be a positive change for the markets. Less reporting, especially by smaller companies, could allow companies to push the envelope in their financial disclosures and help them avoid, at least for a while, their day of reckoning.With the stock market declining sharply in December and growing concerns about a possible recession, would postponing reporting be good for investors?Corporate America has a strong voice in Washington, so changes in the reporting requirements that put the interests of executives over investors would hardly be surprising.Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year!

The prime minister said the motion would be debated on Wednesday.After two and a half years of negotiation, argument, predictions and posturing, lawmakers at last cast what is likely to be one of the most important votes in their careers, throwing Brexit into limbo with just 73 days until it is scheduled to take effect.• No one knows what will come next, as Britain enters uncharted territory, and various factions make contradictory demands.• Much was at stake in the vote: Britain’s place in Europe, its economic future and possibly the survival of Mrs. May’s increasingly shaky Conservative government.• Debate concluded at 7 p.m., after more than 50 hours of Parliamentary argument that began in early December, and the vote was over at 7:39 p.m. In a surprise, there were no serious attempts to amend the bill before the vote.• Mrs. May must return to Parliament by Monday with a backup plan. If nothing is approved by March 29, Britain would make a “no-deal” departure from the bloc, which could pose dire economic risks. (Many legislators are alarmed about this. Voters, not so much.)ImageGeoffrey Cox, the attorney general, in London on Tuesday. He made his case to Parliament, including to members of his own party.CreditAndy Rain/EPA, via ShutterstockA marathon debate finishes with appeals from May and CorbynAt long last, the final day of debate came, and Prime Minister Theresa May made her closing argument to Parliament, continuing to insist, despite all signs that her deal would suffer a crushing defeat, that it was the only viable option, “a decision that will define our country for decades to come.”There is no possibility of negotiating a better pact with Europe, she said, because “no such alternative deal exists,” and a general election would not change that. She again ruled out a second popular referendum on Brexit as a betrayal of the voters’ will, and argued that leaving the European Union without an agreement would be disastrous.But with her deal, she asserted, “we can lay the foundations from which to build a better Britain.”Her appeal came at the close of almost six uninterrupted hours of impassioned pleas in the House of Commons from lawmakers — some angry, others pained — that illustrated the wide-ranging opposition to her deal. In all, there were more than 50 hours of debate, spread across almost six weeks — one of the most exhaustive deliberations in modern parliamentary history.“The withdrawal agreement is, in short, a reckless leap in the dark,” Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said just before Mrs. May spoke. “It risks many companies relocating abroad, taking jobs and investment with them.”The prime minister, he said, “has run down the clock in a cynical attempt to strong-arm members into backing her agreement.”The right path, Mr. Corbyn said, was to reject the bill, delay the Brexit deadline and call parliamentary elections. — Richard Pérez-PeñaImageA Brexit opponent outside Parliament in London on Monday.CreditClodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersLong-awaited bill faced dim prospects all alongSince June 2016, when 52 percent of British voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union, everything had built up to the vote on Tuesday. The bill would have determined the trade and immigration relationship between Britain and the bloc through the end of 2020, while a permanent agreement is negotiated.Long before lawmakers began debating Prime Minister Theresa May’s bill in December, it seemed doomed.She postponed the vote for a month, rather than face a humiliating defeat, as she tried to win new promises from Brussels. But the parliamentary calculus has not changed.Mrs. May’s Conservative Party was divided over the plan — one of her whips stepped down on Monday so that he could vote against it, the latest in a long string of Brexit-related resignations — and the opposition parties overwhelmingly opposed it. — Richard Pérez-Peña[Theresa May scrambles to save her E.U. withdrawal bill from a crushing defeat.]ImageJeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, wants to force early elections, and seems likely to call for a vote of no confidence in the government.CreditLeon Neal/Getty ImagesWhat happens next?With Prime Minister Theresa May’s bill defeated, the question dominating British politics is: What comes next?Mrs. May has until Monday to present a backup plan to Parliament. The range of possibilities is wide, unappealing and a bit bewildering.If the deal had lost by a narrow margin, she might have tried to win a few concessions from Brussels and return to Parliament for a second vote. But with a resounding defeat, that option becomes less likely.As things now stand, Britain will leave the European Union on March 29. Neither Mrs. May’s government nor the European bloc wants that to happen without an agreement in place — most experts predict that a no-deal Brexit would be chaotic and economically damaging.With little time left to negotiate anew, the prime minister may be forced to ask Parliament to postpone Brexit.She could also call a second referendum, an option favored by lawmakers who hope that British voters have changed their minds. And Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, wants to force early elections, in the hope of taking power.But a note of caution about those who would write off Mrs. May when the situation looks bleak. She has been here before. And before that. And, yes, before that, too. — Richard Pérez-Peña[Read more about the Brexit possibilities here]ImageHard-line supporters of Brexit argue that the prime minister’s deal ties Britain far too closely to European trade rules.CreditOli Scarff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor businesses, a chance to gain clarity is lostThe vote did nothing to help little of the detail that businesses need to plan their operations.“The longer this Brexit political drama continues, the less and less attractive the U.K. is going to be” to investors, Iain Anderson, the executive chairman of the consulting firm Cicero Group, said last week.Although many businesses are preparing for the worst-case scenario — crashing out of the European Union without a deal in place — they have also been vocal in warning against it.“Make no mistake, no-deal cannot be ‘managed,’ ” Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said last week.The government has tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to ease public anxiety over a no-deal scenario. Last week it created an artificial traffic jam to test how to manage disruption at the border, an exercise that was widely derided.Manufacturers fear that a no-deal exit would wreak havoc on just-in-time manufacturing, which relies on parts crossing borders and arriving within minutes of assembly. — Amie TsangImageAn anti-Brexit sign near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The deal reached with Brussels would keep Northern Ireland more closely tied to the bloc than with the rest of Britain.CreditPaulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesThe deal took fire from multiple directionsThere were many objections to the Brexit bill, making clear that no approach to leaving the European Union commanded anything close to majority support.Hard-line pro-Brexit Conservatives argued that the deal tied Britain much too closely to European trade rules for the foreseeable future. Many contended that a no-deal exit from the bloc would be preferable.The 1998 accord that brought peace to Northern Ireland guarantees free movement of goods and people between that part of Britain and the Republic of Ireland, a European Union member. But many Conservatives, and the Democratic Unionist Party, a small group in Northern Ireland allied with Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, objected to the way her proposal would protect that guarantee.The deal Mrs. May reached with Brussels includes a “backstop” that would keep Northern Ireland more closely tied to the bloc than with the rest of Britain if the two sides are unable to reach a long-term agreement by the end of 2020. Critics said that would effectively divide Britain in two.There are lawmakers in several parties who oppose Brexit in any form and want a second referendum. And Mrs. May has accused the opposition Labour Party of political opportunism, by simply opposing anything her government tries to do. — Richard Pérez-PeñaImageJohn Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, presides over debates.CreditJessica Taylor/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesParliament speaker is caught in the middleHe’s the unlikeliest star of this season of Brexit, alternately reviled and adored and often on tabloid front pages: John Bercow, the House of Commons speaker. His job, as the highest authority in the chamber, is to preside over debates and, mostly, to get members to shut up.The role is supposed to be strictly nonpartisan.But Mr. Bercow — easily recognizable with his floppy silver hair and booming voice — has found himself in the position of an umpire who makes a controversial call in the early innings that could tip the whole game.Last week, a member of Parliament proposed requiring Prime Minister Theresa May to return within three days to announce what the government would do next if the original deal was rejected. She previously had 21 days to decide.By Parliament’s arcane rules (it mostly hinged on the meaning of “forthwith”), Mr. Bercow should have rejected that amendment. But he didn’t. And Parliament passed it by a slim margin.That decision tipped the balance of power to Parliament from Mrs. May’s government, and will let lawmakers weigh in with alternatives.And Mr. Bercow may not be done yet. Commentators said it could end up being the most radical shift in relations between the government and Parliament since the speaker defied King Charles I in 1642. — Benjamin MuellerImageMrs. May with European leaders in Brussels in December.CreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesBrussels waits and watches, warilyThe Brexit drama — psychological and political — has left European Union leaders transfixed and horrified. The other 27 member states have their own domestic political considerations, but the vote in London on Tuesday was particularly momentous, though few felt that it will bring any sort of conclusion.Many expect Prime Minister Theresa May, if she survives, to try to return to Brussels for more talks, and then probably to ask to postpone the withdrawal, set for March 29.European officials seem optimistic that the other 27 states would agree unanimously to an extension, as long as there is a sense that Britain is on track to reach an agreement before elections for the European Parliament begin in May.No one wants a “no-deal” Brexit, even if some think it may shake the markets enough to cause Britain to rethink. Brussels believes strongly that what really matters for a long-term relationship are the negotiations that would follow.Most European leaders want Britain to stay, but they are also fed up with British indecision. And many fear that Mrs. May has lost control over the outcome. — Steven ErlangerFinancial markets are watched closely for reactionsThe pound often bears the brunt of bad Brexit news, though it has also risen when there was good news.With rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal, investors were focused more on the size of the vote margin, 432 to 202, and the possibility that Britain might leave the European Union with no deal in place.“If the bill is not passed, as is widely expected, sterling and U.K. financial assets will probably be unmoved since this is the expectation — the markets have priced it in,” said Nigel Green, the founder of deVere Group, a financial advisory firm, in a note.If there is any sign of a no-deal Brexit, or a new parliamentary election, the pound could suffer. But at the same time, it could rise if Mrs. May is able to buy time and indicates that she intends to extend the negotiation period or adopt a softer stance on Brexit, according to Jordan Rochester, a foreign exchange strategist at the Japanese bank Nomura. — Amie TsangImagePrime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland said his government was preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.CreditJulien Warnand/EPA, via ShutterstockIreland, with much at stake, prepares for the worstPrime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland said on Monday that he was optimistic an agreement would be reached for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but said his government was continuing to prepare for a chaotic no-deal Brexit.Other than Britain itself, no country has as much at stake as Ireland. Britain is its largest trading partner, and many European goods pass through Britain on their way to Ireland.The most controversial part of Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was the “backstop” to preserve free movement of people and commerce across Ireland’s border with Northern Ireland. People on both sides of the border cherish that freedom, and a bungled Brexit could put it at risk.Mr. Varadkar warned reporters in Dublin on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would mean certain medicines could fall into short supply and said that the government must be ready for such possibilities.“I’m not going to say to you that everything is going to be fine,” he said. “Of course there will be interruptions and negative impact, but we’ll be as prepared as we possibly can be.”Before the vote on Tuesday, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that his country must “hold its nerve” on Brexit.After the vote, he said, “we’ll assess the situation.” — Ceylan YeginsuImageAnti-Brexit banners and placards near the Houses of Parliament in London.CreditToby Melville/ReutersA series of expected votes did not materializeBefore Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal got a vote Tuesday night, Parliament was expected to take up a series of amendment to the bill. But in the end, only one amendment was considered, and not terribly seriously — it was defeated, 600 to 24.More than a dozen amendments were introduced — some to tweak the agreement, others to change it substantially, and still others to kill it.But the House Speaker, John Bercow, who has wide leeway to reject amendments, ruled Tuesday afternoon that only four would be considered. Two of the four amendments, introduced by opposition leaders, would have scuttled Mrs. May’s deal while also rejecting a “no-deal” exit and committing to a pursuit of other options.But in a surprise move, when the amendments were called at 7 p.m., the sponsors of three of the four withdrew them. The only amendment left to vote on would have given Britain the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop agreement without the consent of the European Union — a condition that Brussels considers unacceptable.Amendments that the government supported were rejected by Mr. Bercow, adding fuel to Conservative accusations that he has not been an impartial arbiter.— Benjamin MuellerBusiness backed the deal, but says the government needs a Plan BThe Confederation of British Industry, representing 190,000 businesses, voiced its support for Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal on Tuesday, but said it expected the government to have an alternative solution if the bill failed.“The vast majority of business would like to see this deal passed tonight,” John Allan, the group’s president, told the BBC. “But we’ve got to be realistic, it looks extremely unlikely that it will be, and we’ll be in a new situation tomorrow morning.”“This will be a situation of national emergency,” he said. “We are only 70-plus days away from crashing out of the E.U. Businesses are making decisions every day about postponing investments, moving jobs to Europe.”A no-deal exit would do “irreparable harm to the U.K. economy,” Mr. Allan warned.This week, C.B.I. and the consulting firm PwC reported that their quarterly survey of the finance industry showed that the volume of business done in London had shrunk for the first time in five years, as the uncertainty created by Brexit took its toll. — Amie Tsang For more breaking news and in-depth reporting, follow @nytimesworld on Twitter.Related CoverageRemain or Leave?

President Trump abruptly walked out of a meeting on the government shutdown with Democratic leaders at the White House.“Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time,” the president tweeted. “I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!”Democrats said that the president had thrown a “temper tantrum.” Above, Senator Chuck Schumer after the meeting.For now, at least, the president’s forceful response has papered over cracks in Republican support that threatened to upend his negotiating position. And as a last resort, Mr. Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a border wall._____ImageCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times2. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsel’s Russia investigation, is expected to leave his post after President Trump’s pick to lead the Justice Department is confirmed.Mr. Rosenstein has been a central figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties to the Trump campaign — both for appointing Robert Mueller to lead it and for becoming a target of the president’s rage.Mr. Trump nominated William Barr to be attorney general after he fired Jeff Sessions. Confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin on Jan. 15.Separately, House Democrats now have the power to investigate Mr. Trump and his administration, but they’re moving in a slow, orderly manner.

It’s virtually certain to be rejected in a crucial vote next week — and that could mean weeks of perilous political brinkmanship.In the past two days, Parliament has already delivered Mrs. May two setbacks. First, lawmakers passed an amendment requiring the prime minister to return within days of a losing vote with plans for proceeding. What kind of plan is unclear.Parliament also passed a measure making it difficult for Britain to leave the European Union without a deal. The prospects of a second public referendum on Brexit are rising, and there is even talk of delaying the March 29 departure date._____ImageCreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York Times4.

For decades, a Chinese government campaign has promoted exercise to combat alarming rates of childhood obesity.But the initiative was notable for what it didn’t mention: the importance of cutting back on junk food and sugary beverages.It turns out that China’s fitness-first message has largely been the handiwork of Coca-Cola and other Western food and beverage giants, according to two new studies.The findings show how the food and beverage giants worked with key Chinese officials, through a nonprofit they financed, to stave off the growing movement for food regulation and soda taxes._____ImageCreditWhitten Sabbatini for The New York Times6.

The event was at least partially overshadowed by the impasse over the president’s demand for $5 billion to fund a wall along the southwestern border. And the stalemate served as an ominous sign for any hope that the newly empowered Democrats, the Republican-controlled Senate and Mr. Trump can find areas of compromise in the next two years.Democratic leaders view the voting and ethics measure — named the For the People Act — as the opening salvo in a two-year campaign to either make law or drive a wedge between Mr. Trump and the voters who supported him.Some of those wedge issues will be driven by different vehicles — key House committees are expected to soon draft legislation pumping tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and to lower prescription drug prices. They are also already planning quick action on more liberal policy priorities, including legislation mandating universal background checks for gun purchases and a bill stalled in the Senate designed to provide job protections to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Mr. Trump and his campaign.But the For the People Act, or H.R. 1, remains a centerpiece. At almost 600 pages, the bill is a compendium of liberal proposals to marginalize the influence of money in politics, protect American elections from foreign threats, reduce political partisanship in the elections process and expand voter participation.Leaning on constitutional authority to determine the parameters of House elections, the bill would effectively outlaw the gerrymandering of congressional districts, a practice employed by both Republicans and Democrats to maximize one-party control of individual states by sorting voters into districts according to their politics. Instead, states would be required to form independent commissions to draw districts based on apolitical metrics — a change that Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said would give voters “a fair chance to elect the Congress of their choice.” State legislative districts would be unaffected.Seeking to reverse Republicans’ state-level efforts to tighten access to polling places, the legislation mandates that state election officials automatically register eligible citizens to vote and outlaws certain tactics meant to remove voters from the rolls — provisions that would most likely protect minority voters.VideoThe current government shutdown is now the second-longest in U.S. history. So how does this happen and who is affected?CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York Times“As the foundation of our system, it must be strengthened and preserved,” said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil-rights leader. “There are forces trying to make it harder and more difficult for people to participate and we must drown out these forces.”Though it would take a constitutional amendment to limit the amount of money being spent to influence elections, the legislation would ban contributions by corporations substantially owned or controlled by foreigners, and would require nonprofit organizations — like unions and organizations registered under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that participate in political activity — to disclose the identity of donors who contribute more than $10,000. It would also require large digital companies to make public who is purchasing political ads, provisions included in the Honest Ads Act during the last Congress.The legislation would also prohibit coordination between campaigns and outside groups and expand the public financing system for House and presidential candidates. And it would require presidential inaugural committees, which are subject to very little oversight, to publicly account for their expenditures.Directly targeting Mr. Trump, who has broken with decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, the legislation would require presidents, vice presidents and candidates for those offices to make public 10 years of those files.And to clamp down on ethics violations, it would provide funds to beef up Justice Department enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, tighten federal lobbying rules and strengthen the authority of the Office of Government Ethics.House Democrats said they planned to simultaneously pursue legislation intended to restore key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2013.Democrats formally introduced the legislation on Thursday, the first day of the new Congress. But it will most likely take more than a month for lawmakers to move the bill to the House floor. One House official said Democrats hoped to have the bill passed by mid-February, if the government can be fully funded.The legislation unites veteran Democratic lawmakers with many of the party’s newest elected members who captured Republican seats by promising to clean up the influence of big-money donors and lobbyists in Congress and the White House. It quickly won praise from advocacy groups focused on limiting money and influence-peddling in politics.But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called much of it “probably” unconstitutional. He has been one of the Senate’s fiercest opponents of tightening campaign finance laws and forcing donor disclosures, and has generally opposed federal intervention in elections. After the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the enforcement provisions within the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Mr. McConnell said it was not necessary to offer an alternative.At a Wall Street Journal event in early December, he predicted that the House bill was “not going to go anywhere in the Senate.”Conceding the majority leader’s view could be a death knell for now, Representative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who oversaw the drafting of the legislation, predicted that Republicans would lose in the court of public opinion.“If he wants to ultimately stand with his arms folded between the American people and their democracy, then he should go right ahead,” Mr. Sarbanes said. “But I think he is going to get knocked over by the sentiment of the country right now.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

British lawmakers dealt a crushing defeat to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union.The 432-to-202 vote was the biggest loss in the House of Commons in recent history for a prime minister. The turn of events thrusts Britain into further political chaos just 10 weeks before the country’s scheduled exit from the E.U. Mrs. May above center.The opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn put forward a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, which Parliament will debate and vote on Wednesday. As things stand, the prime minister must return to Parliament by Monday to present a backup withdrawal plan.If nothing is approved by March 29, Britain will make a “no-deal” exit from the E.U., which lawmakers have warned could be chaotic and pose grave economic risks. Here are some other ways everything could shake out._____ImageCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times2. President Trump’s nominee for attorney general assured senators at his confirmation hearing that he would allow the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to finish the Russia investigation, and promised to withstand any political pressure from the White House.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” William Barr said of the inquiry, which is believed to be in its final stages.With Republicans firmly in control of the Senate, his confirmation to lead the Justice Department appears to be on track.Mr. Barr, who also served as attorney general under President George Bush, is known for his unusually expansive views of executive power. But during the hearing, he qualified some of his beliefs, emphasizing legal limits on the presidency and the independence of law enforcement._____ImageCreditErin Schaff for The New York Times3.

The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning white supremacy, reflecting anger in both parties over comments by Representative Steve King of Iowa questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.Mr. King, who has a history of making racist remarks and insulting immigrants, was stripped of two House committee seats Monday, after comments he made to The Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”Mr. King, above, took to the House floor to say he would vote in support of the resolution, which called out his remarks specifically. Only one representative voted against it, saying “anything short of a censure” was shallow.Separately, a federal judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

According to new reports, a group of Democrats used online disinformation against Mr. Moore.CreditCreditWilliam Widmer for The New York TimesBy Jim RutenbergJan. 13, 2019The Russian media was having way too much fun last week.They were downright gleeful over new reports that a group of Democrats had used online disinformation in the campaign against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama in 2017.“Well, well, well,” went the general line in the Russian media, “look what we have here.”Their reaction was understandable, given the news that American political operatives had tried the same kind of troll operations that United States intelligence officials believe the Russian government used in an attempt to swing the 2016 presidential election to Donald J. Trump.The Russian news outlet Sputnik jumped on the news, saying last week that the Alabama operation “seems to cast Democrats’ Russiagate accusations into further doubt.”Also getting in on the action was RT, the Kremlin-financed news organization once known as Russia Today. “The only ‘Russian bots’ to meddle in U.S. elections,” the network reported, “belonged to Democrat-linked experts.”The disinformation campaign in Alabama included a scheme to produce false evidence that Russian Twitter bots were working to elect Mr. Moore. After the revelations first came to light, John Griffing, a former executive director of the Harris County Republican Party in Texas, appeared on RT to go after the Democrats.“I’ve always been suspicious that the Russia-bot narrative was flimsy and probably made up,” Mr. Griffing told RT viewers. “Simply because that’s the kind of thing the Democratic Party does — they make things up in order to create the basis for an attack on the right wing.”In addition to giving Russia new ammunition in its defense against election-meddling allegations, the progressives’ political caper in Alabama sent a chilling message to the rest of us: Reality-warping attacks are now coming from inside the house.ImageJonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, was one of the people involved in the Moore disinformation campaign. He has minimized the effort, saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time.CreditNew KnowledgeIf the trend intensifies, the 2020 presidential campaign will make the media shenanigans of 2016 seem genteel.Sputnik and RT were keying off two articles in The New York Times, which broke the news of the Alabama efforts. The first, by Scott Shane and Alan Blinder in late December, detailed an operation that included the creation of fake Russian Twitter accounts, as well as a phony Facebook page purportedly set up by conservative Alabamians opposed to Mr. Moore, who ended up losing to his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.One of the people behind that effort, Jonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, minimized the effort by saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time (though an internal report said the project was seeking to depress turnout for Mr. Moore).The main financial backer of that project, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, disavowed it, saying he did not know the money he had donated to groups affiliated with Democrats would finance such a thing. “I want to be unequivocal,” he wrote on Medium. “There is absolutely no place in our democracy for manipulating facts or using falsehoods to gain political power.”Mr. Jones, the politician who benefited from the operation, angrily denounced it and called for a federal investigation. So maybe there was reason to think it was all just a blip.Then came the second Times article, last week, on another shady tactic used against Mr. Moore. This one involved a Facebook page for a fake group of Baptists supporting Mr. Moore as a potential ally in their bid to ban alcohol in Alabama — a surefire way to alienate voters if ever there was one.The phony teetotaling campaign was the work of another group of liberal activists with different financiers, whose identities remain unknown. And it came with an implicit warning: Get used to it.ImageThe main financial backer of the Alabama project, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, disavowed it, saying he did not know the money he had donated to groups affiliated with Democrats would finance such a thing.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesAs one of the organizers, the progressive activist Matt Osborne, told The Times, “If you don’t do it, you’re fighting with one hand tied behind your back.” Given the way some of Mr. Trump’s backers — here and in Russia — have engaged in such tactics, he said, there was “a moral imperative to do this.”Researchers who have been studying the Russian disinformation tactics have been girding for just such a development.“One of the things we’ve been talking about in the last year is how the real threat’s going to be when it’s not just Russia or Iran — nation-states with budgets — but when every single person with an issue starts engaging in this type of manipulative behavior,” said Bret Schafer, an analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a research project at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “It’s absolutely awful for democracy.”Mr. Schafer had particular reason to be chagrined. New Knowledge helped build the website for the Alliance’s disinformation-tracking database, Hamilton68, which had monitored suspected Russian-linked accounts, tracking the falsehoods they spread and the discord they tried to sow. (New Knowledge also helped write a report on Russian troll activity released last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee.) The Alabama project, Mr. Schafer told me, “undercuts our collective ability to take other countries to task for their deceptive, online behavior.”Fight-fire-with-fire reasoning is bubbling up on the left as the social media giants continue to struggle to stop distortion campaigns in real time. It was only after The Times and The Washington Post reported on the Alabama operations that Facebook shut down the suspect accounts.None of this bodes well for the 2020 campaign, which has entered its first stage at a time when analysts in and out of government are still trying to determine the full effect disinformation had in the last presidential election.Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has concluded that the Russian activity probably affected the outcome. In “Cyber War,” her just-published book about the 2016 campaign, she reports that Russia “tried to mobilize, demobilize, and shift the sorts of voters that Trump needed to win.”ImageThe Democrat Doug Jones, after his victory in the Alabama Senate race.CreditJohnathon Kelso for The New York TimesIf the results of the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III confirm her conclusion, some people may be deterred from employing such tactics. On the other hand, nothing spawns copycats like victory.Big questions remain about how to keep American political campaigns from descending into disinformation, barring still-elusive legal or technical remedies, as Ms. Jamieson told me in an interview. “How do you make sure it’s marked off as inappropriate?” she said. “The real question for 2020 is, what is out of bounds? Is there anything?”As a start, I reached out to various expected 2020 players to see if they would eschew such tactics.I was heartened to receive this statement from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey: “There is no place in our politics for deceptive tactics that undermine trust in — and the credibility of — our democratic process and stand in contrast to our values.”Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential exploratory committee said, “Our campaign doesn’t support these kinds of tactics.” The campaign manager for Representative Tulsi Gabbard’s 2020 committee, Rania Batrice, said Ms. Gabbard “strongly condemns” the use of disinformation.The Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel — sounding as if she might be relishing the Democrats’ turn under the microscope — said, “These tactics are shameful.”Then there were those whose offices I never heard back from — Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, the Democratic Party itself and Mr. Trump’s re-election team.The real surprise was former Vice President Joe Biden.“Not going to have any comment on that for you,” a spokesman said.Maybe Mr. Biden wants to keep his options open.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Fake News From Within Is on the Rise.

Another Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for “the most extreme circumstances.”Mr. Trump, who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of Democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off-ramp in sight, hinted on Friday that the warnings were having an effect.“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” he told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room as the shutdown approached its fourth week. Minutes later he contradicted himself, saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to.As Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have proved immune to Mr. Trump’s threats, the idea of using the president’s constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the White House because it would enable Mr. Trump to obtain the $5.7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of Congress.Instead, Mr. Trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by Congress for other purposes. Toward that end, the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about $13.9 billion in emergency aide set aside for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California. And with the money secured, the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown.That would allow Mr. Trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional Democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges.Former White House aides, who noted that Mr. Trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency, said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it.But opposition has come from many Republican quarters. Some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power. Kellyanne Conway, a White House aide, has said it would essentially give Congress a pass. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government.He called it “a bad escape hatch” that was going to anger many House members.Mr. Trump’s reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action. “If it’s a crisis, treat it like a crisis,” Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, said in an interview. “His best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it.”On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to the border in Texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo-op along the banks of the Rio Grande on Thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it. He sidestepped the issue when Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like.“There’s some compromise needed,” Mr. Trump said.But Mr. Trump, who allies said was eager to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an Oval Office address and travel to Texas on Thursday, is left with few good options.ImageAsylum seekers in Tijuana, Mexico, outside an entry point into the United States.CreditMark Abramson for The New York TimesAs he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump is finding himself boxed in, in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues. Former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame.In March, Mr. Trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young adults brought to the United States illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit.Racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice, Mr. Trump turned to an adviser and asked, “How do I get out of this?”In the end, Mr. Trump was saved, at least temporarily, by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program. Mr. Trump moved on.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. That ban was almost immediately halted in court. A second, rewritten version, however, was upheld by the Supreme Court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration.But Mr. Trump vented, privately and publicly, that the version that passed legal muster was “watered down” and “P.C.,” and made him look “weak.”How Mr. Trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to September, when White House aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding. But he was told to postpone the fight until after the election, to avoid forcing vulnerable Republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall.When he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for, conservatives like Ann Coulter excoriated him, describing him as “gutless,” and he backed down. Soon he was telling Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi during a televised Oval Office meeting last month that he would proudly “own the shutdown,” thrilling conservatives.Buoyed by the praise, and encouraged by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump decided to keep digging in.But that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate, according to a half-dozen people in the White House or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown.Mr. Trump’s allies insist that he is winning the political battle.“Democrats are boxed in,” said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. “Every time the president and G.O.P. go to the Democrats with a fix, they say no, which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem, and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week, emerged from a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday declaring that it was clear Democrats “don’t want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.”And he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against. “Mr. President, declare a national emergency now,” he said. “Build a wall now.”Mr. Trump’s aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29. But the White House also has drafts based on the shutdown being over — or well into its sixth week.Correction: Jan. 11, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money in emergency aid the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study as a possible source of funding for a border barrier. It is $13.9 billion, not $13.9 million.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.

But first:ImageCreditTravis Long/The News & Observer, via Associated Press1. Scientists say the world’s oceans are heating up far, far more rapidly — 40 percent faster on average — than previously thought. The finding, in a newly published analysis, has dire implications.The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. Their escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive. Above, Hurricane Florence pummeling Atlantic Beach, N.C., this fall.Continued heating will only make those effects more catastrophic, the scientists say._____ImageCreditJonathan Ernst/Reuters2. “No wall, no deal.”Vice President Mike Pence flatly declared there could be no agreement to reopen the government without funding for a border wall — terms that Democrats have already rejected.And a bipartisan plan developed in the Senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing deportation also seemed to be dead on arrival.The partial shutdown, now in its 20th day, will almost certainly become the longest in American history, surpassing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995.That leaves 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay. One example of the impact: 600 pollution inspectors and other workers at the Environmental Protection Agency responsible for detecting violations that endanger human health are off the job.Here’s a state-by-state look at the shutdown’s impact. And here are stories from federal employees, describing their sacrifices and preparations._____ImageCreditDoug Mills/The New York Times3. Along the border in Texas, on a trip that he did not want to take, to discuss a crisis that Democrats say does not exist, President Trump repeated his demand for a wall.He reiterated an untrue claim that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement, and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants. Above, Mr. Trump in McAllen, Tex.“If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it’s steel or concrete,” Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, “they wouldn’t even bother trying. We could stop that cold.”The president continued to float the idea of declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass Congress to fund the wall.Separately, our journalists are driving the length of the approximately 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border.

Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama._____ImageCreditBaz Ratner/Reuters6. Tensions are high in Congo. Election officials awarded the presidency to a candidate who was not seen as the top vote-getter. That dashed hopes of an undisputed transfer of power as the longtime leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila, steps down.Still, the pick — Felix Tshisekedi, pictured above in December — wasn’t Mr. Kabila’s first choice. That means Mr. Kabila’s candidate lost so badly that his government could not simply hand him the presidency without risking widespread violence and international condemnation.But it was unclear how the decision to pass over the leading opposition figure, Martin Fayulu, would sit with the population._____ImageCreditAnastasiia Sapon for The New York Times7.

The extravagant splendor of the animal kingdom can’t be explained by natural selection alone — so how did it come to be?A new generation of biologists is reviving a theory originally proposed by Charles Darwin 150 years ago. Beauty, they say, does not have to be a proxy for health or advantageous genes. Above, a male Indian peafowl.Sometimes, they argue, beauty is the glorious but meaningless flowering of arbitrary preference. Animals simply find certain features — a blush of red, a feathered flourish — to be appealing. And that innate sense of beauty itself can become an engine of evolution.The scientists’ thinking isn’t just rewriting the standard explanation for how beauty evolves — it’s changing the way we think about evolution itself._____ImageCreditHBO9.

But it took little more than 24 hours this week for a freshman House Democrat’s exuberant, expletive-laden impeachment promise to upend the bonhomie of a new Congress and prompt President Trump, by his own telling, to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him.The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol. By the time Mr. Trump discussed the matter directly in a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, weeks of speculation about his potential peril had burst into the open.Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trump’s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib — some of it racially tinged. (Ms. Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, is one of the first Muslims in Congress. The Christian Broadcasting Network referred to her as a “foul-mouthed Islamic congresswoman.”) Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous and premature, offered worried words meant to tamp down speculation about their intentions.[President Trump threatened to keep the federal government partly closed for “months or even years.”]Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically — as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s — or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first.“We even talked about that today,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden, referring to an exchange with Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a meeting earlier Friday to try to negotiate an end to the shutdown of the government, which Mr. Trump threatened to keep closed for years if he did not get money from Congress for a wall on the southern border. “I said, Why don’t you use this for impeachment? And Nancy said, We’re not looking to impeach you.”Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization. The president had indeed invoked Ms. Tlaib and other House Democrats who want to impeach him, they said, but Ms. Pelosi tried to shift the meeting back to its intended topic and did not offer the president reassurances.“In his opening comments at the meeting, President Trump brought up impeachment,” Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. “Speaker Pelosi made clear that today’s meeting was about re-opening government, not impeachment.”Regardless, Mr. Trump’s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference.Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter, “How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time?” He continued the theme at his news conference by asserting that “you can’t impeach somebody who is doing a great job.”Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trump’s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats. But the words of Ms. Tlaib, who stood by her comments on Friday, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office.“People love you and you win,” Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night. “And when your son looks at you and says: ‘Momma, look, you won. Bullies don’t win.’ And I said, ‘Baby, they don’t.’ Because we’re going to go in there, and we’re going to impeach the motherfucker.”She made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that “I will always speak truth to power” and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. She told a Detroit television station that “it’s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it.”Her outburst ran counter to all Democratic talking points. Ms. Pelosi and her deputies have repeatedly made the case that it is too early to consider impeachment. Even as Mr. Trump’s legal perils have deepened — and federal prosecutors in New York appear to have gathered evidence implicating him in a campaign finance crime — Democrats have said they want to wait to see the findings of an investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of the president, his campaign and Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.“I don’t really like that kind of language,” Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee — where any impeachment inquiry must begin — said on CNN. “But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts.”Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speaker’s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University. “I’m not in the censorship business,” Ms. Pelosi said.The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House. A vote to impeach takes a simple majority in the House, but a two-thirds vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the country’s democratic institutions. Privately, many harbor suspicions that he obstructed justice, collaborated with the Russians in 2016 or both. But they also argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump in the 2020 campaign. In the meantime, they are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign and his administration.“We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason,” Ms. Pelosi said. “So we’ll just have to see how it comes.”Republicans ignored the distinction.“Is this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference. He repeatedly singled out Ms. Pelosi, asking why she had not censured Ms. Tlaib.Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib.“I thought her comments were disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said at the news conference. “I think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family.” He added that her comments were “disrespectful to the United States of America.”Ms. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats. Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas formally introduced an article of impeachment on Thursday, charging that Mr. Trump had obstructed justice in firing James B.

Others are expected to follow.“I continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,” Mr. Sherman said in a statement. “I hope that the articles of impeachment are the subject of hearings before the Judiciary Committee early in 2019.”Many of Ms. Tlaib’s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently.“Donald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,” said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee. “It will just be a matter of which one comes first.”But, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making “a martyr” out of Mr. Trump by affording him “a fairer investigation than he deserves.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Cry to Impeach

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.China deepens a diplomatic rift with Canada, Theresa May braces for a Brexit defeat and sexual assault allegations rattle South Korea’s sports community. Here’s the latest:ImageRobert Lloyd Schellenberg of Canada

It took another 32 months before he was declared guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He appealed his sentence, maintaining that he was framed. A court ordered his retrial last month.Why it matters: The retrial came just weeks after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Mr. Schellenberg’s family had voiced fears that he would be used as a bargaining chip.What’s next? The death sentence needs to be examined and ratified by China’s highest court. The fate of two other Canadians arrested in China and accused of “endangering national security” remains unclear.ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain arrived at Parliament a day before a critical Brexit vote.CreditWill Oliver/EPA, via ShutterstockWith Brexit defeat looming, May scrambles to limit her lossesThe British Parliament is gearing up for a critical vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan — and defeat is so widely expected that Mrs. May has been fighting not to avert a loss but to manage its magnitude.In that vein, the prime minister enlisted fresh assurances from Europe’s most senior officials and warned again of the dangers of a chaotic “no deal” withdrawal. She also tried to cajole hard-line Brexiteers to support her, even if they hate her plan.The vote could go down as a historically awful defeat — a margin of more than 100 votes would constitute a big loss.Details: The vote is expected to take place on Tuesday evening in London. We’ll have live updates on nytimes.com.ImageShim Suk-hee at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics last year.CreditDamir Sagolj/ReutersSouth Korea’s #MeToo movement reaches sportsShim Suk-hee, a two-time Olympic gold medalist on the national speedskating team, said this month that she was repeatedly raped by her former coach, Cho Jae-beom, since she was 17.Mr. Cho was fired before the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and has already been sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes. But Ms. Shim’s accusations have sent shock waves through the sports community.“This unveils the humiliating underside of our country’s glorious facade as a sports powerhouse,” President Moon Jae-in said on Monday.What’s next? The president called for a thorough investigation and more than 260,000 people signed an online petition demanding a longer prison sentence for Mr. Cho.Ms. Shim’s revelation has also inspired other athletes to come forward — a former judo player publicly accused her former coach of repeatedly raping her since she was in high school, and a skating group said at least two other victims planned to speak.ImageJohn Bolton, center, the U.S. national security adviser, at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq last month.CreditAndrew Harnik/Associated PressThe Trump administration’s evolving Middle East strategyLast year, after Iranian-backed militants fired rockets into an empty lot at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, asked for military options to strike Iran. The request alarmed several Pentagon officials including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary.Mr. Mattis and other military leaders opposed retaliating, arguing that the attack was insignificant. In the end, that position won out. But now senior Pentagon officials are voicing concern that Mr. Bolton’s policy of isolating and pressuring Iran could set off an armed conflict.In Saudi Arabia: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss several thorny issues that have weakened the Saudi-U.S. alliance, including the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. At the same time, Mr. Pompeo reaffirmed the two nations’ shared opposition to Iran’s regional policies.Here’s what else is happeningRussia investigation: President Trump’s attorney general nominee said he would allow the special counsel Robert Mueller to finish his investigation, seeking to allay Democrats’ fears.Lion Air: Indonesia found the cockpit voice recorder of Flight 610, which could help explain how the plane crashed into the Java Sea in October, killing everyone on board. Officials said the data would probably take two to three months to analyze.Chinese vaccines: Local officials are investigating complaints that more than 100 children received expired polio vaccinations after hundreds of parents protested over the weekend, the latest in a string of similar scandals.1MDB: Goldman Sachs has tried to blame a few rogue bankers for the multibillion-dollar fraud. But the Malaysian government isn’t buying it: “Don’t tell me you don’t know where the money went,” said the country’s finance minister, speaking with our journalist in Hong Kong.ImageSerena Williams practicing in Melbourne.CreditKim Kyung-Hoon/ReutersSerena Williams: The tennis star is back in Melbourne for the Australian Open, which she won in 2017 while pregnant. This time, though, the conversation around her threatens to overshadow the tournament itself. Follow along here for the latest from the Open.U.S. shutdown: Airports across the country — including international hubs in Houston and Atlanta — closed some checkpoints as federal officers, who are going without pay during the government shutdown, didn’t show up to work.Poland: The mayor of Gdansk, who was a liberal critic of the right-wing national government, died after he was stabbed onstage at a charity concert, stunning an increasingly divided country. The police said the assailant was mentally disturbed and had no clear political motive.Gin: Sales of the juniper-flavored liquor in Britain hit about $2.6 billion last year, a revival that has made it the country’s second-most-popular spirit — surpassing whiskey.Skiing in Kashmir: Gulmarg, in the Himalayas, is one of the world’s highest ski spots.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexBriefingSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperBriefing|President Trump, U.S. Shutdown, Greece: Your Monday BriefingAdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, U.S. Shutdown, Greece: Your Monday BriefingLet us help you start your day. By Penn BullockJan. 13, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. President Trump faces tests of his political survival, the U.S. government shutdown has become the country’s longest in history, and the Greek prime minister calls for a confidence vote. Here’s the latest: ImagePresident Trump hosting a discussion on border security at the White House on Friday. His presidency is facing existential tests.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesPerils mount for the Trump presidency.The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a political war for survival “that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison,” our chief White House correspondent writes.News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president’s behavior that investigators took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia. That inquiry was taken over by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, when he was appointed.And The Washington Post first reported that the president had gone to great lengths to conceal his conversations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the past two years. Current and former officials told our reporters that this practice has caused anxiety within Mr. Trump’s own administration.Congress: Democrats in the House of Representatives might move to subpoena interpreters present at the meetings. And on Tuesday, they will grill former Attorney General William Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office, about his approach to the special counsel. Next month, they’ll question Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and they cautioned Mr. Trump against any attempt to influence or discourage his testimony. The response: Mr. Trump attacked the F.B.I. and its former top officials on Twitter over news of the counterintelligence investigation and denied The Post’s report.ImageSecret Service officers standing guard outside the White House on Sunday. They are not getting paid during the partial government shutdown.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesAt 23 days, the longest U.S. government shutdown ever.The partial shutdown is now the longest-ever gap in American government funding, surpassing the previous record of 21 days under the Clinton administration.President Trump is still digging in on his demand for money for a wall at the southern border, though he has backed away from declaring a national emergency to build one — which has been seen as the only way out of the impasse with House Democrats. Meanwhile, a new caravan of migrants is forming in Honduras and promises to further charge the debate.Impact: Here’s a visual look at the shutdown’s far-reaching consequences for the 800,000 federal workers who are going without pay.Another angle: The British Parliament is all but certain to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan on Tuesday, leaving the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. mired in uncertainty. Our journalists examine how the crises afflicting two venerable, historic democracies can affect the whole world. ImagePrime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece in Athens on Sunday after the resignation of Defense Minister Panos Kammenos.CreditYorgos Karahalis/Associated PressThe Greek government is thrown into turmoil.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece called for a confidence vote after a coalition partner on the right quit over a proposed pact on Macedonia’s name.What happened: Days ago, Macedonian lawmakers agreed to officially change their country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in order to end a long-running dispute with Greece and open the door for the small Balkan nation’s membership in NATO and the E.U. But the deal infuriated the Greek defense minister, prompting him to resign. History: Greece has long effectively blocked Macedonia from NATO, insisting that Macedonians were a Hellenistic people and therefore the name could not be claimed by the Slavic people living in the country today. Many Greeks believe that the new name implies claims to Greek territory, because Greece has a northern region named Macedonia.What’s next? The confidence vote is expected to be held this week, after two days of debate from Tuesday morning.
The deal on the name could go before the Greek Parliament for approval as soon as this month. ImageA fishing boat in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, across the English Channel from Britain. Increasing numbers of migrants are trying to cross Channel waters for Britain.CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesA new kind of boatlift on France’s Channel coast.Boulogne-sur-Mer, France’s largest fishing port, has been spooked by a surge in attempted and even successful thefts of fishing boats. The culprits are migrant smugglers. They are increasingly secreting migrants, mainly Iranians who can afford the high costs, across the English Channel to Britain in small vessels, some of them stolen. Numbers: Last year, there were 78 crossings and attempts to cross the Channel, involving a total of about 500 migrants — 10 times as many as in 2017. More than half made it across. No one is known to have died so far, but there is fear that a fatality is inevitable. Impact: The relatively small numbers notwithstanding, headlines and anti-immigration politicians in Britain are calling it a crisis. Some French fishermen are vowing to sit up all night in their boats, cradling their guns. Here’s what else is happeningHuawei: The Chinese telecommunications giant fired an employee who was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for Beijing, the latest diplomatic tangle for the company after the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada last year.Poland: The left-leaning mayor of Gdansk was stabbed in the heart on Sunday night while he spoke at a fund-raiser by an assailant with political grievances, officials said.Afghanistan: Dozens of boys are imprisoned in Kabul as national security threats, many of them accused of trying to become suicide bombers. What to do with them when they finish their sentences is a conundrum for the authorities.ImageA custom hat made from Nissan Figaro parts at a classic car show in Surrey, England.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesNissan: In 1991, the Japanese automaker created a small batch of the quirky Figaro model and never even exported it out of the country.

By Penn BullockJan. 14, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. President Trump discusses pulling out of NATO, Britain’s Parliament is set to hold a momentous Brexit vote, and American airports are feeling the government shutdown. Here’s the latest: ImagePresident Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the NATO summit meeting in Brussels last July.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesPresident Trump discussed pulling the U.S. from NATO.On multiple occasions last year, the president said that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. from the 69-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization, senior administration officials told our reporters, revealing highly sensitive efforts to preserve the alliance. Such desires underline concerns about Mr. Trump’s secretive relationship with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Withdrawing the U.S. from NATO would be a grand victory for Mr. Putin and effectively destroy a 29-country alliance that undergirds the E.U.’s security and the world order, and senior administration officials were at first unsure if Mr. Trump was serious. He was, and so his national security team scrambled to run interference and keep the U.S. in. Mr. Trump’s belief that NATO is a money-loser appears to be fundamental to his worldview, along with an often-stated desire to seize Iraq’s oil, officials said. Reaction: “Even discussing the idea of leaving NATO — let alone actually doing so — would be the gift of the century for Putin,” said retired Adm. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO. He added that withdrawal would be a “geopolitical mistake of epic proportion.” ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain arriving at Downing Street on Monday.CreditLeon Neal/Getty ImagesHigh drama set for the British Parliament.The British Parliament is gearing up for a critical vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan — and defeat is so widely expected that Mrs. May has been fighting not to avert a loss but to manage its magnitude.In that vein, the prime minister enlisted fresh assurances from Europe’s most senior officials and warned again of the dangers of a chaotic “no deal” withdrawal from the E.U. She also tried to cajole hard-line Brexiteers to support her, even if they hate her plan.The vote could go down as a historically awful defeat — a margin of more than 100 votes would constitute a big loss. Her leadership hangs in the balance.Another angle: Despite predictions that a no-deal Brexit could cause everything from insulin shortages to an 8 percent drop in gross domestic product, many Brexit supporters brush off the fears, even as some of the strongest pro-Brexit voices join in the warnings. More: The vote is expected to take place on Tuesday evening in London. We’ll have live updates on nytimes.com. ImageA T.S.A. officer closing the entrance to a terminal at Miami International Airport on Saturday. CreditCristobal Herrera/EPA, via ShutterstockAirports feel the impact from the U.S. shutdown.Asked to work without pay during a partial government shutdown, one of every 13 airport screeners in the U.S. is now failing to show up, and the country’s airports are beginning to groan. International hubs in Houston and Atlanta closed a number of checkpoints. Canadian air traffic controllers sent their American counterparts hundreds of pizzas as consolation for working without pay.What’s next? Airport security could eventually collapse as workers desert their jobs. But President Trump rejected a proposal to temporarily reopen the government while continuing talks with Democratic lawmakers on funding a wall on the southern border. Response: Senate Republicans are largely standing behind the president, and so are Republican voters, including many federal workers affected by the shutdown. ImageRamzan Kadyrov, center, leader of the Russian region of Chechnya, in October. He has instituted brutal crackdowns on gay people.CreditYelena Afonina\TASS, via Getty ImagesReport says Chechnya renewed anti-gay pogrom.Though Russia decriminalized homosexuality during the breakup of the Soviet Union, the police in the region of Chechnya have periodically detained gay people in extrajudicial arrests, and a new report paints a harrowing picture of a recent crackdown that applied tactics used against Islamist terrorists to round up gay people.Details: Since late last year in Chechnya, two gay men have been killed and about 40 men and women who are either gay or suspected of being gay have been detained in a makeshift prison, according to a rights group, the Russian LGBT Network. Background: Moscow gives Chechnya’s regional leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, an Islamist, significant leeway in exchange for loyalty, but international pressure had seemed to tamp down an anti-gay campaign his government began in 2017. Rights activists say they are alarmed by the report of a new crackdown.In Poland: Mayor Pawel Adamowicz of Gdansk, a leading liberal critic of the populist, right-wing national government and a supporter of gay rights, died from his injuries after he was stabbed at a charity event by a man described by the authorities as mentally disturbed. Here’s what else is happeningChina: A court sentenced a Canadian to death for drug smuggling at a one-day retrial ordered weeks after a Chinese executive’s arrest in Canada, escalating tensions between the two countries.Saudi Arabia: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he pressed Saudi Arabia’s crown prince on a number of thorny issues that have weakened the American-Saudi alliance, including the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, while affirming a shared goal of opposing Iran. A fractious Middle East means Mr. Pompeo faces major obstacles in trying to form a wider coalition against Iran.ImageJackals patrolling a garbage dump in Croatia.

Here’s the latest: ImagePresident Trump in the Cabinet Room on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesPerils mount for the Trump presidency.The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival “that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison,” writes our chief White House correspondent.News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.And The Washington Post reported that the president had taken extensive steps to conceal his conversations with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin over the past two years.Congress: Democrats in the House will, on Tuesday, grill former Attorney General William Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Next month, they’ll question Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The response: Mr. Trump attacked the F.B.I. and its former top officials on Twitter over news of the investigation and denied The Post’s report.ImagePresident Bill Clinton making a statement on a 21-day government shutdown during his administration.CreditDavid Scull/The New York TimesThe longest U.S. government shutdown ever.The partial shutdown is now the longest ever gap in American government funding, surpassing the previous record of 21 days under the Clinton administration in 1995.President Trump is still digging in on his demand for money for a wall at the southern border, though he has backed away from declaring a national emergency. House Democrats refuse to accede.Impact: Here’s a visual look at the shutdown’s far-reaching consequences for the 800,000 federal workers who are going without pay.The roots: Decisions made in the 1970s helped lay the groundwork for today’s dysfunction.Another angle: The British Parliament is all but certain to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan on Tuesday, leaving the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. mired in uncertainty. Our journalists examine how the crises afflicting two venerable, historic democracies can impact the whole world. ImageChinese and Ugandan workers at a hydroelectric power station project under construction in eastern Uganda.CreditJoao Silva/The New York TimesIn Africa, the U.S. struggles to catch up to China.China’s investments in Africa are central to President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road initiative. The Trump administration sees it as an aggressive debt-trap scheme aimed at extending Beijing’s political influence around the world.Case study: In 2016, an American consortium of oil and gas executives from General Electric put in a bid to build a $4 billion oil refinery in Uganda that could be the largest in East Africa. It faced long odds against the competition, two Chinese energy companies with deep pockets, Beijing’s support and significant pull with the Ugandan government.Why it matters: The Ugandan case demonstrates the difficulties western governments face as they try to push back against China. In October, the Trump administration set aside $60 billion in financing for global projects — though that is still a fraction of what Beijing has pledged to spend.ImageYoung men being searched at a juvenile detention center in Kabul, Afghanistan.CreditKiana Hayeri for The New York TimesWhat’s to become of boys jailed as Taliban recruits?In Kabul, Afghanistan, dozens of boys are held at a juvenile detention center as national security threats, charged with planting, carrying or making bombs and trying to become suicide bombers.The Times, which was granted exclusive access to the prison a few months ago, found that many bear deep cuts and bruises — some self-inflicted, others from the bombs they are said to have detonated. None admit the full range of the crimes they’re accused of.“The Taliban made me fight for them,” said one. “The local police beat me to force me to confess,” said another.The problem: So far, counseling the boys to steer them away from extremism hasn’t seemed to work. So what are the authorities to do with them at the end of their sentences, when their added years could enable them to cause worse mayhem? Here’s what else is happeningHuawei: The Chinese telecommunications giant fired an employee who was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for Beijing, the latest diplomatic tangle for the company after the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada.Syria: The U.S. military started withdrawing some equipment from the conflict as part of President Trump’s order to wind down America’s presence there, amid growing confusion and mixed signals over the pullout.Saudi Arabia: The young Saudi woman who fled from her family and spent a week lobbying for her freedom from Bangkok’s international airport arrived safely in Canada, where she was granted asylum. Her case has brought the status of Saudi women and the difficulties of escaping the kingdom into sharp focus.From Opinion: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Saudi Arabia to meet with the crown prince and discuss the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi. A Saudi woman living in Belgium argues that Mr. Pompeo should also bring up the fate of jailed female political prisoners — like her own sister.ImageNissan’s Figaro on display at a car show in Britain.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesNissan: In 1991, the Japanese automaker created a small batch of the quirky Figaro model and never even exported it out of the country. But today, it enjoys immense popularity in Britain.Indonesia: A woman who recorded her boss’s lewd phone call was fired and eventually jailed, while his career flourished. The case, whose final appeal is before the Supreme Court, has become a very public example of the country’s lack of sexual harassment protection for women.Who is MacKenzie Bezos? A novelist who, as the wife of Jeff Bezos, played an integral part in getting Amazon started. And now, after 25 years of marriage, she could be awarded one of the largest divorce settlements to date.SpaceX: Elon Musk’s rocket company is cutting 10 percent of its work force in what the company said was preparation for the “extraordinary challenges ahead.” With its remaining 6,000 workers, the company plans to move forward to create space-based internet and launch a capsule to carry NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.Beauty of the beasts: The extravagant splendor in the animal kingdom is pushing biologists to rethink Darwin’s theory of evolution.Smarter Living Tips for a more fulfilling life.ImageCreditCraig Lee for The New York TimesRecipe of the day: Start the week with a comforting bowl of Tuscan farro soup.How to be writer?

A big reason for that sell-off was concern about the economy and corporate profits.In the “preseason,” Apple warned that fewer people in China were buying iPhones than it would like, and American Airlines said it wasn’t getting as much revenue from every passenger as it wanted.Such details help gauge the health of the economy, and that’s where the trouble can begin. If too many chief executives start to warn about problems ahead, investors could see their worst fears confirmed — and stocks could start to fall again.Maybe don’t check your 401(k) until this is over.Mohammed Hadi, our business news director, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

The agency’s employees have called out sick in increased numbers across the country since the shutdown began.CreditCreditPam Panchak/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, via Associated PressBy Niraj ChokshiJan. 2, 2019Updated Jan. 10.The partial shutdown of the federal government is nearing the end of its third full week. If it continues through Saturday, it will become the longest such shutdown on record.While some essential work, such as mail delivery and law enforcement, is still being performed, the shutdown has affected operations at nine departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, State and Treasury, and several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA.Much work has ground to a halt. About 800,000 government workers are living without pay, with more than half working and most likely being repaid once the government reopens and the rest sent home with no such expectation. And, if history is any guide, it may ultimately cost more to have shut down the government than to have left it open.[Analysis: President Trump’s insistence on a border wall is boxing him in.]Here’s a brief look at some of the government functions that have and have not been affected by the shutdown.Airport securitySince the shutdown began, Transportation Security Administration workers, many of them responsible for screening passengers and baggage, have been calling out sick in increased numbers at airports across the country.Last week, a federal official who spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity said that the call-outs seemed to be a coordinated protest, but union officials said that many workers were most likely just looking for work elsewhere to cover for missed wages. A T.S.A. spokesman played down the disruption.This week, a union that represents tens of thousands of T.S.A. officers said that some officers had quit and many were considering quitting because of financial hardship.[Government workers feel like “pawns” in a political chess game.]____ImageYellowstone National Park in October.CreditJosh Haner/The New York TimesParks and museumsMany national parks are closed to visitors. And while some remain open with limited staffing or thanks to help from states, the National Park Service has warned that “access may change without notice.”Joshua Tree National Park, for example, remained open after the shutdown, but then suffered temporary or partial closings as officials struggled to keep up with the toll visitors had taken. At some parks, volunteers have stepped in to help with cleanup.[Read more on how parks and museums are affected by the shutdown.]Limited staffing has also raised questions about visitor safety. At least three people have died on National Park Service land since the shutdown began, and while it is unclear if the shutdown had any effect on the authorities’ immediate responses to the accidents, the announcement of at least one of the deaths was reportedly delayed because of the lack of resources.Museums have been affected, too. The National Gallery of Art, all 19 Smithsonian museums, and the National Zoo were closed last week because of the shutdown. (“Essential personnel” remain on hand at the zoo to care for the animals.)[Though the museum is closed, you may still be able to see the art within. Some paintings have a double life online.]____Science, research and public healthThe scientific community has been affected, too. Some government labs are empty, with scientists having been sent home. Research, some of it time sensitive, has been disrupted. And the flow of grant money may be interrupted, too.Some agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, are largely or entirely unaffected. But others, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, have sent many workers home.[Read more about the shutdown’s toll on science and research.]Inspections of chemical factories, power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants, and thousands of other industrial sites have also ground to a halt because the Environmental Protection Agency had to furlough most of its employees in charge of inspecting pollution and monitoring compliance.____ImageThousands of veterans, active-duty members of the military, reserve personnel and supporters marching in Manhattan for the annual Veterans Day Parade.CreditDave Sanders for The New York TimesFood inspections and aidThe shutdown has also affected food safety oversight.While the Agriculture Department is still inspecting meat, poultry, eggs, grain and other commodities, the Food and Drug Administration has stopped its routine inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods at high risk of contamination.The 40 million or so people who receive food stamps will still receive the benefit for January, according to the Agriculture Department, which administers the program. And other programs focused on child nutrition, including school lunch and breakfast programs, will continue operating into February, the department said.Food assistance programs for women, children and infants and for people on Native American reservations can continue to operate at the state and local level, depending on what funding remains, but federal funding for those programs is suspended until the shutdown ends, the department said.[Here’s how the shutdown leaves food, medicine and pay in doubt for Native Americans.]____Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans AffairsFear not, older Americans: The Social Security checks are still coming. (And the Postal Service will still deliver them.)That’s because the Social Security Administration received funding for the 2019 fiscal year back in September, according to Mark Hinkle, an agency spokesman.“Social Security services and offices will remain fully operational, and Social Security benefits will be paid on time,” he said in an emailed statement.Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits are similarly unaffected.[Fact Check: President Trump has told a number of falsehoods about the shutdown.]____Law enforcement and the judiciaryTens of thousands of law enforcement personnel are among those working without pay.That includes workers at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, and more.But the shutdown has nonetheless affected the criminal justice system. Federal court proceedings have slowed as government lawyers ask for delays and federal district courts remain open though their funding remains in doubt.Already backlogged, most immigration courts are closed because of the shutdown, leading to long delays in deportations.“That is the irony of this shutdown,” Judge Amiena Khan, the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges’ union, told The Times. “The impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward.”[How the shutdown could turn a day in court into a four-year wait.]____Criminal investigationsThe shutdown has had mixed effects on government investigations.F.B.I. investigations will continue, according to the Justice Department’s shutdown plan, because “all operations of the F.B.I. are directed toward national security and investigations of violations of law involving protection of life and property.”The office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III,
will also continue its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because it does not rely on congressional action for funding.At the Securities and Exchange Commission, though, all but 6 percent of the agency’s approximately 4,400 employees have been sent home, according to a contingency plan. That limited staff will handle emergency enforcement, but much investigative work is not being done.____ImageWith tax filing season about to begin, the Internal Revenue Service will no doubt face plenty of questions from taxpayers over the recent changes to tax law.CreditAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Internal Revenue ServiceWhen the shutdown began, most I.R.S. operations
stopped, with just about 12 percent of the agency’s nearly 80,000 employees still working, according to a contingency plan.That plan, which covered the end of last year, did not make clear what the I.R.S. would do in 2019. The White House has said it will call back I.R.S. employees in order to make sure tax refunds are issued, though it remains unclear whether it has the authority to do so.[What the shutdown would look like if it happened in other industries.]With tax filing season about to begin, the agency will no doubt face plenty of questions from taxpayers over the recent changes to tax law.____The Violence Against Women ActThe Violence Against Women Act, which funds programs for survivors of domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault, expired last month when the government shut down.The Justice Department already awarded grants to those programs for the 2019 fiscal year, but its payment system was affected by the shutdown. As a result, requests for grant payments filed after Dec. 26 are on hold during the shutdown.“Local programs have other sources of funds,” said Monica McLaughlin, the director of public policy at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “But when they are in a situation where they’ve done the work that is federally funded and they aren’t able to reimburse for it, it certainly puts them in a financial bind.”Christina Caron, Liam Stack and Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. British Parliament rejects Theresa May’s Brexit plan, President Trump’s attorney general nominee testifies in Congress and gay penguins in Sydney learn to co-parent. Here’s the latest: ImagePrime Minister Theresa May in Parliament during the Brexit vote.CreditParliament TV, via EPA, via ShutterstockParliament overwhelmingly rejects Brexit planBritish lawmakers voted 432-to-202 against Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to leave the E.U. It was the biggest defeat in the House of Commons in recent history.The turn of events thrusts Britain into further political chaos just 10 weeks before the country’s scheduled exit from the bloc.What’s next? The opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn put forward a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, which Parliament will debate and vote on Wednesday. If the motion is successful, a new government will need to be formed in 14 days.Meanwhile, Mrs. May must now return to Parliament by Monday with a backup withdrawal plan. And if nothing is approved by March 29, Britain will make a “no-deal” exit from the E.U., which lawmakers have warned could be chaotic and pose grave economic risks. Here are some other ways this could all shake out.Go deeper: Here’s a visual journey through Brexit, from the moment Britain voted to leave the E.U. in 2016 to the final vote today.ImageWilliam Barr appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for confirmation hearings.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesU.S. senators question Trump’s attorney general pickPresident Trump’s nominee to lead the Justice Department made assurances at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that he would allow the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to finish the Russia investigation, and promised to withstand any political pressure from the White House.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” the nominee, William Barr, said of the inquiry, which is believed to be in its final stages.With Republicans firmly in control of the Senate, his confirmation appears to be on track.Go deeper: Mr. Barr, who also served as attorney general under President George Bush, is known for his unusually expansive views of executive power. But during the hearing, he qualified some of his beliefs, emphasizing legal limits on the presidency and law enforcement independence. ImageRen Zhengfei meeting with the news media this week.CreditVincent Yu/Associated PressHuawei’s founder rejects spying claimsRen Zhengfei, a legend in China akin to Steve Jobs, made a rare public appearance and denied claims that the technology giant was spying for Beijing.“I love my country,” he told a group of reporters. “I support the Communist Party. But I will never do anything to harm any country in the world.”They were his first public remarks since his daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S. last month. She is charged with trying to trick financial institutions into violating sanctions against Iran.Background: Huawei, founded in 1987, is the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker — it had an estimated $100 billion in sales last year and sells more smartphones than Apple. Yet Mr. Ren rarely makes public appearances; he spoke to the news media for the first time in 2013.ImageThe rights activist Huang Qi in his home in 2012.CreditGillian Wong/Associated PressProminent rights activist goes on trial in ChinaHuang Qi, one of the country’s most prominent online dissidents, went on trial on charges of leaking state secrets.Background: Mr. Huang founded the website 64 Tianwang in 1999. He was jailed twice before, first in 2000 for publishing articles by overseas dissidents and ethnic and religious critics. Then in 2010 for work uncovering corrupt building practices that contributed to the death toll of the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan.Why it matters: Mr. Huang’s case has drawn intense international attention, in part because he suffers from a potentially fatal kidney disease. And after his 85-year-old mother sought help from foreign embassies to win his release, she was reportedly beaten and is now detained in a hospital.What’s next? It’s unclear. American diplomats said they were denied access to the trial. One human rights group based in the U.S. said that “no member of the public was allowed to attend” and that “one of Huang’s lawyers was never told about the trial.”Here’s what else is happeningEl Chapo trial: In an incendiary accusation at the crime lord’s trial, a former cartel leader accused the former Mexican president President Peña Nieto of taking a $100 million bribe from drug traffickers.NATO: President Trump privately suggested several times last year that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. from the military alliance with Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years. North Korea: The country is pursuing biological weapons that could present a more immediate threat to the world than its nuclear weapons program, according to new military analysis.Carlos Ghosn: The former Nissan chairman was denied bail in Tokyo and faces at least two more months in jail. His wife criticized Japan’s criminal justice system, writing that “no human being should be detained under conditions so harsh that their only plausible purpose is to coerce a confession.”Netflix: The company said it would raise prices by 13 to 18 percent for U.S. subscribers to help pay for original content, its biggest rate increase since it introduced streaming services 12 years ago.Saudi woman: Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, who fled her home and was granted refugee status in Canada, is starting to adjust to her newfound freedom. “I want to do crazy things I’ve never done before,” she told us in an interview.Gender achievement gap: Girls outperform boys in American schools, starting as early as kindergarten. But there’s an exception: Asian-American boys don’t start lagging behind until adolescence, according to a new study that points to the influence of social pressures.Speaking of Canada: The country’s air traffic controllers sent hundreds of pizzas to their American counterparts, who have been working without pay during the partial government shutdown.ImageA gay penguin couple in Sydney with their baby.CreditSea Life Sydney AquariumGay penguins: Two male penguins in Australia are raising a chick together, capturing the hearts of a nation that made same-sex marriage legal just over a year ago. “Love is love,” said a manager at the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium.Chang’e-4: Here’s a look at what China’s spacecraft has learned about the far side of the moon.Australian Open: Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka advanced through the first rounds.

Since the 1990s, China has outstripped all other countries in production.Potatoes are hardly new to China. They were introduced about 400 years ago, and feature in beloved regional dishes, like the shredded Sichuan specialty called tudousi.But for starch, Chinese consumers prefer rice and noodles.One workaround is to process the tubers into potato flour, which is then mixed with wheat flour to make steamed bread, noodles and cakes. The government also promotes regional potato dishes, and supports the production of fries and potato chips.Claire Fu (付欣怡), a news researcher in our Beijing Bureau, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexU.S.SubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperU.S.|Students in Rural America Ask, ‘What Is a University Without a History Major?’AdvertisementSupported byStudents in Rural America Ask, ‘What Is a University Without a History Major?’ImageThe University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, facing declining enrollment and revenue, is weighing major changes to its degree programs.CreditCreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesBy Mitch SmithJan. 12, 2019STEVENS POINT, Wis. — Chancellor Bernie Patterson’s message to his campus was blunt: To remain solvent and relevant, his 125-year-old university needed to reinvent itself.Some longstanding liberal arts degrees, including those in history, French and German, would be eliminated. Career-focused programs would become a key investment. Tenured faculty members could lose their jobs. The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Dr. Patterson explained in a memo, could “no longer be all things to all people.”Dr. Patterson’s plan came as Stevens Point and many other public universities in rural America face a crisis. Such colleges have served as anchors for their regions, educating generations of residents.Now student enrollment has plummeted, money from states has dropped and demographic trends promise even worse days ahead.Universities like Stevens Point are experiencing the opposite of what is happening at some of the nation’s most selective schools, like Harvard, Northwestern and the University of California, Berkeley, where floods of applications have led to overwhelming numbers of rejected students.But critics say that in trying to carve out a sustainable path for Stevens Point — and build a model for other struggling, regionally focused universities — administrators are risking the very essence of a four-year college experience.“Part of the fear is, is this an attempt to really kind of radically change the identity of this institution?” asked Jennifer Collins, a political-science professor, who wondered aloud whether Stevens Point would become a “pre-professional, more polytechnic type of university.”Kim Mueller, 21, a senior who hopes to become a history teacher at a Wisconsin high school, said her first reaction to the proposal was: “What is a university without a history major?”ImageBernie Patterson, the chancellor at Stevens Point.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesNestled in a city of 26,000 residents in the middle of the state, Stevens Point has seen its fortunes rise and fall with its region. Founded more than a century ago to train teachers, and distinguished by Old Main, an 1894 building with a famous cupola that overlooks the campus, the college grew as people moved to the area’s paper mills and farms.The college became a pathway to the middle class, a respected place to get a bachelor’s degree without spending too much money or moving too far from home. By the 1970s, it had strengthened its liberal arts programs and joined the state university system.But in recent decades, troubling signs cropped up. Young families left rural Wisconsin for Madison and Milwaukee, which had their own University of Wisconsin campuses. Fewer students graduated from high school in the area around Stevens Point, including a 14 percent drop in its home county from 2012 to 2016. And under former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican whose term ended Monday, state funding declined and a mandatory tuition freeze made it hard for the college to make up the difference.By last spring, the university, which has about 7,700 students, was looking at a two-year deficit of about $4.5 million. The state, which had provided half the university’s budget in the 1970s, was now covering only 17 percent of it.“Sometimes, I liken it to climate change,” said Greg Summers, the provost, who helped come up with the plan to remake Stevens Point. “The higher-ed climate has changed profoundly and it’s not going back to the old normal.”The turmoil is not unique to Stevens Point, where nearly half the students are the first generation in their family to attend college. In large parts of the Midwest and Northeast, public universities far from urban centers are hurting for students and money. And they are facing painful choices.Almost four hours from Chicago, Western Illinois University eliminated dozens of vacant faculty positions last year and announced it would lay off 24 professors, including some with tenure.In Maine, the state university system folded a small campus into its flagship and merged some functions at two other remote campuses.ImageStevens Point students in a plant biology class.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesAnd in Vermont, where state funding for higher education is among the lowest in the country, officials consolidated two small public colleges into a single university to try to save about $2 million a year.“We tried to look ahead and take action before we were not able to help ourselves,” said Jeb Spaulding, the chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges System, whose colleges are also pushing apprenticeship and nondegree programs in hopes of attracting more students.The locations of college campuses can be a reflection of a bygone America. Most universities were founded generations ago, when rural communities were thriving and when traveling across a state to a larger urban campus was more complicated. As people moved toward cities and the Sun Belt, and as cars and planes connected the country, many rural universities have fallen on hard times.“There is and ought to be a bit of a scramble to redefine and resituate themselves,” said David Tandberg, a vice president for the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. “There’s nothing they can do about birthrates. That’s something they have no control about. So it’s opening up different markets and offering different services.”The same trends that have led to cuts at rural public colleges, which often struggle but almost never close, have forced some private colleges out of business, including Dana College in Nebraska and St. Catharine College in Kentucky. Some historically black institutions, both public and private, have also faced financial and enrollment challenges. South Carolina State University fended off threats of closing in recent years and has struggled to recruit students to its rural campus. Wilberforce University, a private historically black institution in Ohio, has faced accreditation questions and budget deficits.All the while, flagship public campuses in many states, including Wisconsin, have remained vibrant. Those universities often have much larger endowments and the ability to recruit high-performing students from across the country, insulating them somewhat from funding crises.“Budget cuts will give the flagship university a cold and the regional public colleges pneumonia,” said Thomas Harnisch of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.At Stevens Point, where flashing signs announce the next hockey game and low-slung buildings sit near evergreens, administrators are trying to make up for increasingly elusive freshmen.ImageGreg Summers, the provost, said that by making hard decisions now and “doing fewer things better,” the university could find a more stable future.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesTheir solutions: Recruit more midcareer adults to enroll in programs such as nursing. Promote majors such as business and education with clear career paths. And invest in teaching people specialties with local appeal — forestry or fisheries management — on a campus with a 280-acre nature conservancy that doubles as an outdoor laboratory for natural resources students.In the coming months, after a final round of campus review, Dr. Patterson will present a list of proposed changes to the University of Wisconsin regents. Dr. Summers, the provost, said that by making hard decisions now and “doing fewer things better,” the university could find a more stable future.The proposal was especially bitter for liberal arts professors, who have viewed their disciplines as the backbone of the college experience but now fear losing their jobs. Stevens Point administrators have winnowed an initial list of majors to eliminate (English and political science were among those spared), but some faculty members said they remained queasy, uncertain about what additional changes the future will bring.“I’m afraid it’s done a great deal of damage to the university’s reputation with current high school students and current high school teachers,” said Lee Willis, the chairman of Stevens Point’s history department, who said there was already stiff competition for students with the University of Wisconsin’s other four-year campuses, five of which are within 115 miles of Stevens Point.“The fear,” Dr. Willis said, “is that we’re going to get into a death spiral that we won’t be able to pull out of.”Across the campus, where the mascot is the Pointer, a dog, and the school colors, purple and gold, adorn sweatshirts and signs, there has been skepticism and anxiety.“If you want a career-focused program, I think then you could look at a community college or tech school,” said Madeline Abbatacola, a senior studying history and wildlife ecology. Universities like hers, she added, “have a different lane.”Last spring, students held a protest on the campus sundial. In the fall, some professors signed a letter seeking the replacement of university leaders, and some professors are applying for jobs elsewhere. And even those like Dona Warren, a longtime philosophy professor who did not take a position on Dr. Patterson’s plan, said they believed the campus was at an inflection point.“Everyone is just scared to death about the bottom line,” Dr. Warren said. “The suspense movie music has reached its crescendo, and either something’s going to jump out from the corners or something really good is going to happen.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: At Struggling Rural Colleges, No Future for History Degrees.

When I found myself taking meticulous notes on a forthcoming book by Erica Feldmann called HAUSMAGICK: Transform Your Home With Witchcraft (HarperOne, $25.99, available in March). The year 2018 hadn’t been so great, what with the death of a husband and, possibly, a republic. Maybe 2019 would be better if I bought certain purifying elements for my home. The right crystals, sage sticks and — salt? Apparently, you can sprinkle salt around the house after a person with “toxic energy” visits. Attention future dates: If you see me reaching for the shaker as you’re leaving, you know things haven’t gone well.If my nerves are frayed, I take cold comfort in knowing I’m not alone. Whether it’s our political situation, the jangling distractions of everyday life or the not-irrational sense that mankind’s need to find another planet isn’t just a sci-fi plotline, we seem to be in the midst of one massive freakout. Kierkegaard argued that anxiety stemmed from the “dizziness of freedom,” the paralysis that comes from infinite choice and possibility. That was in 1844. Imagine what he would have thought about today.But here’s some good news: If we’re all a little tense, well, there’s a book for that. Many books, actually. Several of the ones I consulted were so wrongheaded or incomprehensible they made me more nervous. (“Motivation is a Unicorn Fart” almost made me hurl in a glittery rainbow arc.) Here are three that worked.Recently a friend told me that he had reached what he calls his vidpoint: the moment you realize you have more movie hours stored on your DVR than you have hours left to live. I thought about that friend while reading Matt Haig’s NOTES ON A NERVOUS PLANET (Penguin, paper, $16), a follow-up to his previous book “Reasons to Stay Alive,” which chronicled his struggles with anxiety and depression. The core of first-world malaise, he argues, can be summed up by something T. S. Eliot observed in “Four Quartets”: We are “distracted from distraction by distraction.” Here, in clever chapterettes and listicles (he seems to assume we’re all too jumpy to read more than a few pages at a time), Haig muses about our anxieties: our fears of aging, of not being rich, of not being beautiful or successful enough. All while being massive consumers of everything. What really sells, he says, is not so much sex as fear. Every day, every minute, we’re deluged with images of people who are prettier, richer and having more fun than we are. And then there’s the bombardment of news, which is presented in a way to provide “more food for our nightmares.” Which is why we must take time to simply turn it all off and go outside. (I’m going to do this just as soon as the Mueller report is delivered.) This isn’t exactly a novel concept, and Haig mentions but doesn’t explore the science of, say, why staring at the sky or simply being out in nature helps our mental health. But he does have some memorable ways of telling us about it. (“Hello. I am the beach. … I have been around for millions of years. I was around at the dawn of life itself. And I have to tell you something. … I am entirely indifferent to your body mass index. … I am oblivious.”) And he has one terrific piece of advice that I’m thinking of sewing on a pillow sampler and giving to my teenage sons: “Never be cool. Never try to be cool. Never worry what the cool people think. Head for the warm people. Life is warmth. You’ll be cool when you’re dead.”I can’t help noting, however, that the last time I checked Haig’s Twitter feed he had posted seven times in two hours. Maybe he’s still trying.“Anxiety” is a mild term for what can be a severe mental illness. In fact, anxiety disorders of various degrees are among the most common mental illnesses in America, affecting more than one in five adults. In HOW NOT TO FALL APART: Lessons Learned on the Road From Self-Harm to Self-Care (TarcherPerigee, paper, $16), Maggy Van Eijk starts with a hopeful message: You can have any number of mental health issues and still learn to cope. Van Eijk, who’s now the BBC’s social media editor, has a history of severe anxiety as well as borderline personality disorder; her arms are scarred from years of cutting. She’s also really funny. Here’s a partial list of what one of her bad anxiety days can look like: “Waking up in the middle of the night to remember that thing I said five years ago was a bit rude. Time to linger on that memory until sunrise! … Having a bath to try to relax but then remembering the bath is basically an open coffin filled with my own liquid filth. … Seeing a pile of clothes in the dark and thinking it looks like a massive panther, then thinking … ‘What if it is a panther?’”Van Eijk’s book is organized around life challenges, and what to remember if they happen to You, Person With Mental Illness. Her explanation of self-harm is particularly touching and helped me to understand why a person might do it. Among the reasons she hasn’t done it, she writes, is that “I’ve been listening to My Chemical Romance all day.” Rather, it’s about the anger that “refuses to leave my body” if she’s upset or about the feeling that “my voice isn’t being heard and it has nowhere to go.” This is a woman who, after a breakup, had to go to a burn unit after repeatedly putting out a cigarette on her arm, so one tends to listen to her about the distraction/substitution methods she uses to stop hurting herself. And her reasons for doing things as mundane as making lists turn out not to be mundane at all. “Lists,” she reminds us, “are a direct link to the future.” And if you’re someone who has thoughts about having no future, she says, they can at least temporarily steer you away from a terrible decision.If I had a self-destructive young adult in my life, someone in real pain, this is probably the book I’d get her.Like many who have experienced recent loss, I tend to bolt upright at 3 in the morning, heart pounding, with one overarching thought: “What now?”
Which is why I found Claire Bidwell Smith’s ANXIETY: The Missing Stage of Grief (Lifelong/Da Capo, $26) both soothing and informative. Smith was 14 and an only child when both of her parents got cancer. If that’s not enough of a breeding ground for a lifetime of anxiety attacks, I don’t know what is.The experience of both parents dying when she was young propelled Smith into hospice work and grief therapy. “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear,” C. S. Lewis wrote in “A Grief Observed,” and Smith understands this observation on the deepest personal level. She goes over techniques for dealing with anxiety, whatever its source. Maybe it’s about the guilt you feel when recalling the decisions you’ve made for a dying loved one; maybe it’s about your loneliness; or maybe, as is often the case in full-blown panic attacks, it’s because you’re convinced that you’re next. Smith’s words are particularly useful for panic attack sufferers. Once you know that you’re not, indeed, dying, she shows you how you can normalize your panic, and how you can look at these episodes with curiosity, not terror. It’s also useful to be reminded that American society isn’t one that honors grief. In many other cultures, she explains, quoting a colleague, you have “six or 12 months of a grieving period where the world doesn’t expect much of you.” Someone give me that one-year-free pass, please.Certainly reading a book or three may not be the answer, and none of these books emphasize, or even discuss, medication as a possible aid. My own thoughts about dealing with severe anxiety? Start with your doctor. And then, for life’s more modest challenges, there’s always my new go-to: A DRINKABLE FEAST: A Cocktail Companion to 1920s Paris (TarcherPerigee, $18), by Philip Greene. I have yet to try a Monkey Gland or a Scoff-Law cocktail, but am infinitely calmer after three glasses of vin blanc cassis — and pleased to know it was a Henry Miller favorite. Four ounces of chilled dry white wine, one ounce of chilled crème de cassis, red fruit for garnish.

Red brain: Science Photo Library/Getty Images. Blue brain: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library.By Willy StaleyJan. 14, 2019On the 12th day of the federal government shutdown, the 45th president of the United States of America posted a meme on his Instagram account: an image of his half-glowering, half-smirking visage, hovering gigantically above the Southwestern desert, dwarfing the picture’s centerpiece — a rendering of his signature campaign promise — and, in a familiar font, some explanatory text: “The Wall Is Coming.” It’s an image that makes you think, That’s from HBO’s hit series “Game of Thrones” — sort of, and then makes you think about the unique privileges and burdens of living in this moment in history.There are so many unusual aspects of Donald Trump’s presidency that his willingness to communicate with the public through internet memes is often overshadowed. Typically, he retweets images made by his most enthusiastic backers — in November he shared one of the Clintons, Barack Obama, Huma Abedin, Robert Mueller, his own deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and others, all locked up in a prison cell together — but the wall meme appears to be a White House original. It is also the second “Game of Thrones” meme the president has shared in the last two months. He does this sort of thing so often that the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently felt compelled to tweet, like an exasperated high school teacher, “Enough with the memes.”It’s impossible to overstate how peculiar it is that the most powerful man in the world, who will turn 73 in June, posts memes. It’s a behavior more often associated with youth, irreverence and a surfeit of free time — though certainly plenty of old, aggrieved people have picked up the habit in recent years. In 2016, the Trump campaign united message-board trolls and Facebook boomers, and together they disseminated so many memes that some of them began to believe — both jokingly and not — that their “meme magic” had helped Trump win the election.In current usage, “meme” refers most often to an image with text overlay, designed for distribution online. They’re like the bumper stickers of the digital realm, in that any one concept can be endlessly remixed to convey just about any sort of sentiment (Calvin can pee on anything). What began more than a decade ago as a fun way to imagine how cats might talk has evolved into a surprisingly fertile mode of political communication. The online database Know Your Meme has confirmed the existence of some 4,066 successful memes in the wild — including newcomers like Big Chungus, a fake series of video games starring an obese rabbit, and classics like Doge, which featured a shiba inu speaking broken English. The actual number is certainly much higher.You might find this very silly, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But keep in mind: The president posts them.All of this represents a long fall from the meme’s origins. The word was coined by the British ethologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book, “The Selfish Gene,” as a way to conceptualize the transmission of culture in biological terms. For Dawkins, a meme, shortened from the Greek mimeme — “an imitated thing” — was a unit of culture, a building block of our mental architecture. “Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs,” Dawkins wrote, “memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain.” They could be as small and short-lived as a tune or catchphrase, he explained, or as large and consequential as “God” and “eternal damnation.”Genes, Dawkins argued, do not aim to propagate a species; they seek only to propagate themselves. Memes, he believed, were similarly selfish. Dawkins spends most of his chapter on memetics fixating on religion, and because he has since become such an aggressively outspoken atheist, reading the book today it is easy to get the sense that he considers religion almost parasitic. The concept of “God,” he figured, endures because it offers a psychological salve to people, while “eternal damnation” survives because it is useful as a means of social control. Thus both live on, copied from generation to generation, latching on to humanity and perpetuating themselves too effectively to be got rid of. “Selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage,” Dawkins wrote.Ideas, in this view, have lives of their own, and the environment in which they struggle for survival is the human mind — our limited processing power means that only the toughest will persevere. “If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain,” Dawkins wrote, “it must do so at the expense of ‘rival’ memes.” He conceded that a meme would also have to compete for airtime on the radio or TV, billboard space, column inches and book pages. But, writing back in the 1970s, he had no reason to consider what would happen if those scarcity conditions vanished. If they did, you would find yourself in a terrifyingly fecund primordial soup in which all sorts of ideas could develop, mutate, cross-pollinate, do battle, die off and be reborn. You would find yourself, well, online.And while this primordial soup has brought forth many novel concepts, and resuscitated some old, corrosive beliefs, the things we call “memes” today are largely just joke formats — mechanisms for the efficient production of humor. They develop less like new ideas and more like algal blooms, spreading until they block out the sun and consume all the oxygen, before dying out naturally (people get sick of them) or getting hit with bleach (explainer journalists write about them). Individually, these memes leave little mark on our culture. Worse than being forgettable, they become, within a year or two, embarrassing to think back on for even one second.But taken as a whole, this swarm of cultural mayflies represents a meaningful shift in our culture. Joke-making, a sometimes cruel enterprise, has been mechanized and democratized. Humor now emerges from the ether, authorless or, more accurate, authored and improved upon by everyone. Jokes are communal now, and constant. Online, everything that happens all day — in politics, in culture, in the news — is rapidly repurposed for laughs, by everyone, all at once.For the most part, this is harmless. After all, what could possibly go wrong in a culture where all anyone wants is to be perpetually amused?Before Trump’s border wall was the cause of a government shutdown, it was a mnemonic device — less a policy proposal than a string tied around the finger. According to a recent article in The Times, the wall was a “memory trick for an undisciplined candidate.” Trump’s advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone knew that getting tough on immigration would play well to a right-wing audience, but they also knew the man they were dealing with. He has a mind for the tactile, so they gave him something gigantic to hang onto: an 1,800-mile-long slab of concrete.But Trump’s talking points were never just talking points. They were more like bits. His campaign rallies were rambling, unscripted affairs, almost like an open-mic comedy set: Not a fearsome Nuremberg rally, but an aging showman road-testing material, seeing what caught the audience’s attention. Early on, his speeches were “all over the place,” the NBC reporter Katy Tur told “Frontline,” but as time passed, “he started to really hone his message, and he started to remember what lines worked.” In the same episode, the writer Marc Fisher said Trump told him that he would simply wait to see the red lights on the TV cameras in the press box turn on, indicating he was live, and then he would say “whatever it took to keep the red light on.”The border wall kept the lights on. At a 2016 rally in Burlington, Vt., Trump mentioned the wall to tremendous, wonderful applause, then paused and asked his audience, “And who’s gonna pay for the wall?” The crowd roared back, “MEXICO!” They — he and his crowd — did this two more times together, then Trump laughed. “I’ve never done it before, I swear,” he said, throwing his arms up as if surprised it had worked. “That was pretty cool. We’re gonna have to use that.”This incentive structure, in which an easily distracted person says a bunch of stuff he kind of means to an assembled audience, slowly learning what generates a reaction and what doesn’t, is familiar: It’s like posting online. This is the process that nudged the wall ever closer to reality, despite the fact that it was only ever supposed to be a metaphor, a shorthand, a catchphrase. It is an idea with no real owner or creator, passed from person to person, from lectern to grandstand to TV and Twitter and back again, copying itself and growing and mutating until it became big, beautiful and tipped with spikes forged from American steel. The border wall is, in the truest sense, a meme: an idea that persists not because it will benefit us but simply because it thrives in our environment. It was so effective at doing whatever it did that it couldn’t be contained, spilling out of the president’s brain and spreading throughout our entire body politic, cooling and hardening like bacon grease, until it finally brought everything to a standstill. And I hate to admit it, but that is a little funny.Willy Staley is a story editor at the magazine.

Saoirse Ronan had a lob, or “long bob,” styled by Ben Skervin. Claire Foy: mini-bob. Maya Rudolph: sharp medium-long bob. Lobs, too, for Lucy Boynton (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) and Irina Shayk, a model. This major bob moment comes exactly 100 years after an avalanche of women — 20,000 per week, according to the Women’s Improvement League — scandalized the world by cutting off their waist-long, painstakingly coiffed Gibson girl dos. They chose instead an ear-grazing crop cut that until then had been worn only by willful, freethinking renegades — Bolsheviks, the Bloomsbury set, the up-and-coming Coco Chanel, Greenwich Village radicals, the fashion-forward ballroom dancer Irene Castle, who catapulted the bob into the American mainstream.Already alert to cultural disruptions, F. Scott Fitzgerald, then 22, promptly wrote a short story, “Bernice Bobs Her Hair,” about the power of this new haircut on a hapless girl from Eau Claire, Wis., sent east to acquire social skills. Faced with taunts and dares, she marches into a barbershop, gets a bob and overnight is transformed into a ruthless, avenging, slash-and-burn Jazz Age vamp.ImageWe'll take the fan too: an early bob on ballroom dancer Irene Castle.CreditIra L. Hill/FPG, via Getty ImagesImageAscending: Louise Brooks, bob icon.CreditHulton Archive/Getty ImagesFitzgerald was prescient about this as so much else. The bob, while now a classic, has never quite lost its unladylike insouciance. Even today, “switching to a bob is a little bit like giving the finger,” said Yves Durif, the New York hairstylist.As if on cue at the start of 2019, this cheeky haircut has resumed its role as a take-no-prisoners rebuke to those long tresses, cascading below the shoulders, that have dominated the opening decades of the 21st century. Mr. Durif, whose clients at his Carlyle Hotel salon include MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski and Kasie Hunt, called this Trump-era Lady Godiva look “clichéd and banal.”“Long hair isn’t even interesting on the runway shows anymore,” said Julie Stahl, the C.E.O. of Blonde & Co., a New York creative content agency.Ahn Co Tran, a hairstylist with a salon in Beverly Hills, said he cuts “oh my God, ever so many bobs.” They’re not a deluge (yet), but more and more are happening in the larger cities.“We’re seeing a turning away from hairdressing and a resurgence of hair cutting,” said Peter Gray, a stylist in New York.This despite what may be an ingrained American partiality to long hair, versus what Michel Obadia, a Moroccan-born veteran hairstylist in New York, called “a European preference for short hair generally and the bob in particular.”“American women want to be beautiful,” Mr. Obadia said. “European woman want to be stylish.” In fact, according to Wendy Iles, a stylist in Paris whose clients have included Marion Cotillard and Léa Sedoux, “the bob defines Frenchwomen’s hairstyles.”“It’s quite a statement to have a bob,” Mr. Skervin said. “You’re either drawn to the bob or you’re intimidated by it. But you own it.”ImageSignature cut: Anna Wintour.CreditJohn Lamparski/WireImage, via Getty ImagesImageRei KawakuboCreditTaylor Hill/WireImage, via Getty ImagesFor decades, this abbreviated haircut has been essentially owned by two of the most important figures in the fashion world: Anna Wintour and Rei Kawakubo. But they have been joined of late by Rihanna, Keira Knightley, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Sandra Bullock and Taraji P. Henson. When Gabrielle Union cut hers last spring, Allure documented the occasion.Even Elizabeth Prelogar, a Russia expert who is on the team of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has been seen in one.What Makes a Bob?The style is defined by its blunt edge, often angled longer in front, reaching somewhere between the earlobe and the collarbone. A versatile cut, it runs the gamut from the rigidly geometric Vidal Sassoon-esque structured ’60s bob to the contemporary textured bob, the asymmetrical bob and what Mr. Tran called “the disheveled, undone, unkempt, whimsical French bob.” And then there’s the “hedgelike topiary bob, much of which is cut freehand,” as engineered by Mr. Skervin for Tessa Thompson’s November 2018 Essence cover. Not to overlook the Isabella-Rossellini-in-the-’90s bob, “blunt, but worn messy,” said George Norwood, a stylist in London. And definitely not to overlook “the most inspiring bob of all,” according to Mr. Durif: “the quintessential sleek, cheek-grazing bob” belonging to the screen actress Louise Brooks, who “wore the look to perfection” in her 1929 film, “Prix de Beauté.”“There’s a bob for everyone,” Mr. Durif said. And it suits all ages. “You see an older woman walk into a room wearing a short, chopped, graphic bob — already she’s won your confidence,” Ms. Iles said. Then there are the bangs. Imagine Mamie Eisenhower’s housewifely 1950s fringe somehow transformed into a must-have subculture statement. That seems to be what’s happening with today’s sought-after blunt micro-bangs and slightly longer sharp-edge baby bangs. “Bangs are for anyone who’s creative,” said Mr. Obadia, an owner of the Pierre Michel Salon for over 50 years.Add-on bangs can be purchased from Amazon (eek). Or for those seeking realistic-looking human-hair bangs, the Angelo David Salon in New York customizes clip-ons tinted to match the wearer’s hair color.Why Now?There are several compelling reasons for the sudden bob surge.No. 1. The damage factor: the need to cut off long hair that’s been weakened by years of extensions, said Marie Sigismondi, a colorist at the Pierre Michel Salon.No. 2. The renegade factor: The bob’s progressive, in-your-face sass is alluring to progressives. It’s got #MeToo credentials. “It’s giving us a new view about what being feminine is,” said Ruth Roche, a hair-industry educator. No. 3. The Batsheva factor: The bob is the perfect contrasting accompaniment to the Laura-Ashley-Gunne-Sax-inspired boho-prairie look that’s flourishing lately. It offsets the flounces and ruffles with needed current context. “A prairie dress with a modern bob — Wow!” Mr. Tran said.No. 4. The artlessness factor: This blunt cut speaks eloquently, as no other hairstyle can, to today’s drive for authenticity. What is it if not a spiffier Buster Brown, the old-timey comic-strip character, never quite losing the impression that it was cut in the kitchen by a cost-saving parent placing a cereal bowl over the child’s head?ImageA bob on the runway at Balenciaga.CreditEstrop/Getty Images“For children, the bob gives character” Mr. Durif said. “On grown women, it’s sexy.”Tove Styrke, a Swedish electropop singer, said: “I like it when it’s really blunt and looks like I cut it myself. It feels so much like me.”The bob appeals to those who want to “look like they’re not living by the usual standards, whose message is, ‘I’m not trying too hard,” said Holli Smith, who does hairstyles for the Balenciaga runway shows.“My bob is romantic, edgy, artistic and so magical it could be fetishized,” said Isabella Lalonde, a media trainee at Christian Dior. “It’s a constant symbol of who I am, and it looks good even if I haven’t washed my hair in a few days.”The Middle GroundFor those attracted to the bob’s bluntness but lacking the nerve to go jaw-length short, as well as for the multitudes who insist on keeping at least a rudimentary ponytail (even a stump), there’s a shoulder-length variant, popular for several seasons now. Emma Stone, Jennifer Lawrence, Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Kim Kardashian and the models Alexa Chung and Emily Ratajkowski have all been seen with lobs.Ms. Roche, the industry educator, isn’t having any of it. A purist, she called the lob “a cop-out. A lob falls to the collar bone, which is definitely below the shoulders! A bob, any bob, has to hit above the shoulders. It’s the space between the shoulders and the jaw that lets the bob look sharp and cool.”ImageFrom left, Kim Kardashian, Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence.CreditFrom left, Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images; Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images; Emma McIntyre/Getty ImagesMaking a course correction, the latest bob permutation is the mini-bob, so ultra short that Mr. Tran called it “the ear bob.” Already it has been spotted on the aptly named Emily Blunt (just call her Mary Loppins), the models Hailey Bieber and Taylor LaShae, and thousands of civilians on Instagram. (Just keep in mind that this bob needs trimming every six to eight weeks, at most.)Nick Arrojo, a hairstylist, has lately been cutting a number of mini-bobs at his salons in Manhattan and Brooklyn. “A shorter bob puts an emphasis on the face, on the individual. It changes the way you appear,” Mr. Arrojo said. “2019 looks very much like the day of the short bob.”“Mini-bobs are gorgeous,” Ms. Iles said.“All of a sudden, you see the shoulders,” Mr. Arrojo said.“All of a sudden, you see the neck,” Mr. Obadia said.The mini-bob, said Alexandra Efstratiou, a stylist at the Arrojo salons, “will be youth led before it trickles down to all age groups and suburbanites, but it’s definitely coming.”Get ready!What About Color?“Color plays a major role in how a bob looks,” Mr. Skervin said. He is one of many stylists who welcome bold special effects on this hairdo: graduated color, for instance, and a technique known as slicing, which involves lightening full slices of hair rather than using the standard weaving technique in highlighting. “With multiple colors sliced in, you get more dimension, more contouring,” said Marie Sigismondi of the Pierre Michel Salon, who has been tinting a lot of bobs in recent months.“The use of color can make a bob look fabulous and fierce,” Ms. Sigismondi added. Her preference is for a darker top section and lighter color underneath. “That, rather than highlighting, gives dimension and variation.” And for a subtle but edgy detail, she darkens a crescent of hair at the nape of the neck, where the bob is shortest.Inspired by the singer Dua Lipa’s bleached bob and the actress Jenna Dewan’s rich chocolate one, Michelle Sevilla, a pre-med student at Queens College, gets hers shorn at Coiffures by Genevieve in Franklin Square. “You don’t see a lot of short hair on Long Island, Ms. Sevilla said. “But a bob is edgy and inspiring; I stand out in it.”It bespeaks a kind of sisterhood.Riding the Hoboken PATH train recently, Ms. Lalonde, the Christian Dior trainee, spotted a female conductor who had the same devil-may-care floppy bob that she has. “We made eye contact and clicked,” she said. “It was a telling moment.”Correction: Jan. 8, 2019An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Alison Brie's hairstyle at the Golden Globes. It was a twist, not a bob.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Let’s Be Perfectly Blunt.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSunday ReviewSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperSunday Review|Speaker Pelosi ReturnsAdvertisementOpinionSupported bySpeaker Pelosi ReturnsWho says there are no second acts in American history?By Kevin BakerMr. Baker is a novelist and historian.Jan. 5, 2019ImageCreditCreditLauren TamakiOn Thursday, Nancy Pelosi became the first person in 64 years to return to the position of speaker of the House of Representatives, completing the most startling comeback in American politics since Richard Nixon became president.Her return says a great deal about Ms. Pelosi and about our politics, but above all it is a triumph of nerve and ability. Republicans have tried for years to make Ms. Pelosi’s very name a curse. President Trump and members of his party have called her, among many other things, the promoter of a “socialist agenda” and the “unhinged face” of her party, while others have labeled her as both the “San Francisco Democrat” that she is, and a “machine” politician from Baltimore, where her father and an older brother both served as mayor.The strategy seemed to be working. Through most of last year’s midterm campaigns, many Democrats also warily avoided endorsing her, speaking instead of the need to embrace “a new generation of leadership” and replace a “toxic brand.” But when the vote for speaker was over last week, there was Ms. Pelosi with gavel in hand again, having lost only 15 votes from her caucus.How did this happen?Qualifying for Congress today has come to seem more and more like the college admission process, where you pile up incredible achievements that will rarely benefit you on campus. The speakership, by contrast, is a place for pluggers. It’s an odd post, rare in democratic politics, where one can serve simultaneously in opposition and the majority, leading your own party in the House while dealing with a president from the other side.There have been political stars in the office. Henry Clay put in the second longest time there. James G. Blaine, “the plumed knight” of post-Civil War Republicans, held the post for nearly six years. Neither of them made it to the position they coveted, in the White House — though the one former speaker who did become chief executive, James K. Polk, was the most successful one-term president in our history. Say what you will about his agenda — and a lot of people, then and now, had a lot to say — Polk was a model of efficiency and won the Mexican War, nearly doubled the size of the United States, lowered tariffs and instituted an independent Treasury system before refusing to run for re-election and quietly dying three months after leaving office. A very speaker-like performance, when you think of it. Ms. Pelosi, the only woman to be speaker, is also the first person to repeat in the office since Sam Rayburn, who served a record 17 years as speaker over three different stretches in the office, the last of which only ended with his death, in 1961. “Mr. Sam,” a moderate Texas Democrat, twice exchanged the speaker’s gavel with his Republican counterpart, Joe Martin, a moderate Massachusetts conservative. This was back in a more parliamentary era, when no one considered the vagaries of voters in a national election to be a reason to kick out a perfectly able congressional leader.Rayburn helped steer the country through World War II and much of the Cold War, served faithfully under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower; became a mentor to Lyndon Johnson; and insisted L.B.J. join the national ticket under John Kennedy. Rayburn also built up one of his successors, the diminutive Carl Albert from Oklahoma, who, after gaining the speakership, twice found himself first in the line of succession to the presidency during the Watergate scandals. On each occasion, Albert did all he could to put others in place before him, believing, as he said on becoming speaker, “I hope we will get together, and work for the country, and not work for the two political parties.”Such a sentiment, not to mention the idea of stepping away from power for the good of the country, seems so alien to our politics today that it might have come from a different age. In light of such service, talk of toxic brands and a new generation of leaders seems misplaced.Rayburn, Albert and Tip O’Neill — who negotiated a key bill with President Ronald Reagan to preserve funding for Social Security — formed the ideal of the modern speakership. They shaped policy, worked with presidents from either party, molded their successors and tried to move the wheel forward. They sought compromise but also tried to bring about what progress had to be made. Above all, they respected the institution they led, the most thoroughly democratic part of our national government.It was a model that worked very well — or at least it did until Newt Gingrich wrecked it, as he wrecked so much that he put his hand to. Mr. Gingrich’s rebellion was aimed at cozy, low-level corruption and complacency, which certainly existed in the old speaker system. But his brand of self-aggrandizing hyperpartisanship proved exactly wrong as a corrective. Unable to conquer or to compromise, he ended up fleeing the Capitol engulfed in investigations and hounded by allegations about his own personal conduct.Ms. Pelosi represents a restoration of that ideal, and she brings formidable talents and a legendary work ethic (back) to the job. In what was described as an “unbelievable marathon” to secure Obamacare, she personally took on the task of winning over 60 wavering Democrats. To win back the speakership this time, she swayed another 60 or so members of her caucus.“For Pelosi, the strategy in every campaign she runs is ‘owning the ground,’” writes her friend Steve Israel, a former congressman, which is “not just a matter of a campaign field operation,” but “extends to message as well.”Ms. Pelosi doesn’t hesitate to associate her own ambitions with the quest for women’s equality — “You know why I do it? I do it because I want women to see you do not get pushed around,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash — and some, including Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, have attributed Ms. Pelosi’s ability to whip a caucus to the mothering skills that come from having five children and eight grandchildren: “She has eyes in the back of her head.”At the same time, she regularly displays what have traditionally — wrongly — been considered male attributes in politics. She keeps her head when all about her are losing theirs and is adept at the deadpan gibe, usually delivered right between the ribs. When President Barack Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel seemed about to abandon the Affordable Care Act in despair, she mocked their proposed alternative as “incrementalism” and “Kiddie Care,” and told them: “We’ll never have a better majority in your presidency in numbers than we’ve got right now. We can make this work.” She proceeded to get it done, vote by vote, maneuver after maneuver.Republicans have already received a full barrage of what Ms. Pelosi can do. She quietly but directly called Mr. Trump out on his lying and “fearmongering” about immigration, labeled the government’s closing the “Trump shutdown” and mocked his planned border wall as a “beaded curtain” and “a manhood thing for him.”The day after Mr. Trump subjected us to a cabinet meeting that seemed like a lost outtake from Charlie Chaplin’s “Great Dictator,” Ms. Pelosi turned the opening of the new Congress into a jubilant festival, one that celebrated the youth and diversity of her party, complete with a table full of Bibles and a male representative rocking a baby. She took her oath of office surrounded by children — and followed it up by pushing through a series of bills that both parties had previously voted for, challenging Republicans to reopen the government and giving a speech that quoted Reagan.In her second stint as speaker, Ms. Pelosi goes into the job with a majority that is 21 seats smaller than what she enjoyed previously, and without a Democratic White House or a Senate majority to aid her. She has limited herself to four years in the job — part of the price of regaining it — and her remarkable energy notwithstanding, she will be nearing her mid-80s when she finishes it. She must navigate a much nastier Washington culture that is likely to turn even uglier as congressional investigations into the president begin, and the Mueller report is delivered.On the other side is Ms. Pelosi’s restive new Democratic majority, which demands a say in setting the agenda. This is not Mr. Sam’s House of Representatives. The brightest new Democratic star, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined a protest in Ms. Pelosi’s office before she even took her seat. When Carl Albert showed up for his first day at the House, he was given a pile of papers to deliver to an office by an older congressman who mistook him for a page. (Albert did as he was told.) Ms. Pelosi would never so disrespect a member, and it may well be that both her new majority and her old-school skills will serve her well. As Ronald Brownstein pointed out in The Atlantic, changing demographics have left her with far fewer conservative Democrats from blue-collar or rural districts — Democrats who hobbled Ms. Pelosi and such previous Democratic speakers as Tom Foley and Tip O’Neill. Her current majority may squabble over economics, but it is unlikely to fight over social issues like immigration, gay rights or abortion.The “San Francisco Democrat” and product of the “Baltimore machine” may be just the person to lead this new coalition. Asked on her first day back as speaker why she would not compromise on the border wall, Ms. Pelosi told the press, seemingly off the cuff: “A wall, in my view is an immorality,” before adding, “It’s the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly.”There was the old Democratic liberalism at its best, idealistic and pragmatic at the same time: The wall is wrong because it’s wrong, plus it won’t work. It’s worth noting that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cast her first vote in Congress to return Nancy Pelosi to the speakership. Mr. Sam would be proud.Kevin Baker is a novelist and historian and the author, most recently, of “America the Ingenious.”Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: Speaker Pelosi Returns.

Breaking: JPMorgan Chase reported profit of $7.1 billion, or $1.98 a share, for the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ expectations. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)Global growth in 2019: ‘Less strong and less synchronized’This year’s economic indicators are not doing much to bolster confidence so far. The World Bank cut its growth forecast. China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into its slowing economy. Apple’s downgraded sales forecast, which led to a market sell-off, was just one of several warnings from major companies.This week, several large banks announce their earnings, along with the likes of Netflix, UnitedHealth and Delta Air Lines. Yesterday, Citigroup reported quarterly revenue of almost half a billion dollars less than analysts had expected, saying economic uncertainty had hurt its trading business.“Almost all economists are forecasting a slowdown” for 2019, Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chairwoman, said in New York yesterday. She added:“The global economy was firing on all cylinders in 2018 and now looks like we’ve got less strong and less synchronized global growth.”The China factor: Companies seen as particularly vulnerable to a Chinese slowdown include Starbucks and, after passenger vehicle sales fell there for the first time in 28 years, Ford and General Motors. Alibaba’s president, Michael Evans, told a retail industry gathering yesterday that “China has slowed down,” blaming “natural causes” and trade tensions with the U.S.A helping hand from Beijing: Chinese officials said today that tax reductions on a “larger scale” were coming, following cuts for major industries and in personal income taxes. It also announced a cut for small companies.Britain’s Brexit vote: Prime Minister Theresa May puts her plan for withdrawing from the E.U. before Parliament later today, less than 75 days before exit would happen automatically. She is widely expected to lose, possibly by a wide margin, which could expose her to a no-confidence vote. European stocks opened higher, and market watchers are bracing for volatility after the vote, but Britons don’t seem that worried yet.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________ImageA Pacific Gas & Electric worker in Paradise, Calif., a town destroyed in a wildfire last year.CreditTalia Herman for The New York TimesP.G.&E.’s bankruptcy tests insurers, investors and regulatorsPacific Gas and Electric Company, the California utility that has been in financial crisis after deadly wildfires in the state, said yesterday that it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the end of the month.The company said its liability for damages from the wildfires could reach $30 billion, report the NYT’s Ivan Penn, Thomas Fuller and Lisa Friedman. The bankruptcy announcement, made in a regulatory filing, pushed the company’s shares down more than 50 percent and posed a challenge for state regulators, who will have to decide whether to raise electricity rates.The utility’s woes could be just part of a wider economic toll from climate change, which is fueling wildfires nationwide.The quick take: Lights will stay on, but power bills are likely to increase. Wildfire victims may have to accept smaller settlements. And California may find it harder to reach ambitious climate change goals.Market fallout: Investors have long considered utilities a safe bet, so this is a reminder that volatility can strike any industry. Shareholders could be wiped out and bondholders could take a hit.A complex bet: The P.G.&E. stock held by the Baupost Group, the hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, is part of a bigger wager on the utility. Baupost also bought $1 billion of legal claims that an insurer held against it.ImageSteel pipes in Baytown, Tex.CreditDavid J. Phillip/Associated PressThe steel industry is under pressurePresident Trump has repeatedly spoken of a revival in the American steel industry, crediting his trade policies.But it’s now 10 months since he imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, and prices in the United States have returned to their old levels. Hiring remains stagnant, and investors are wary about the industry’s long-term strength, the NYT’s Alan Rappeport writes:Stock prices for some of the nation’s biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for Mr. Trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs.The industry’s best hope would be major infrastructure legislation, which looks increasingly unlikely.More: President Trump said yesterday that tariffs had put pressure on China’s weakening economy, but trade talks between the two nations have yielded little.Day 25: It’s still shut downPresident Trump spent a snowy weekend cooped up in the White House, serving fast food to the Clemson Tigers and not giving in to proposals to end the government shutdown. Yesterday, he rejected a suggestion by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to restart operations for three weeks while negotiating.Mr. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico, where his repeated references to a “crisis” have not always reflected reality. His supporters remain behind him, even in areas where the federal government is a major employer and even as polls show that most Americans blame Mr. Trump and Republicans for the shutdown.• The shutdown is a further blow to farmers already hurt by the U.S.-China trade war, the head of the USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council told CNBC.

What Was Said Is a Mystery.AdvertisementSupported byTrump and Putin Have Met Five Times. What Was Said Is a Mystery.ImageWhat President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has told President Trump in their meetings remains largely unknown, even to American officials.CreditCreditSergei Chirikov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Peter BakerJan. 15, 2019WASHINGTON — The first time they met was in Germany. President Trump took his interpreter’s notes afterward and ordered him not to disclose what he heard to anyone. Later that night, at a dinner, Mr. Trump pulled up a seat next to President Vladimir V. Putin to talk without any American witnesses at all.Their third encounter was in Vietnam when Mr. Trump seemed to take Mr. Putin’s word that he had not interfered in American elections. A formal summit meeting followed in Helsinki, Finland, where the two leaders kicked out everyone but the interpreters. Most recently, they chatted in Buenos Aires after Mr. Trump said they would not meet because of Russian aggression.Mr. Trump has adamantly insisted there was “no collusion” with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. But each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship. The unusually secretive way he has handled these meetings has left many in his own administration guessing what happened and piqued the interest of investigators.“What’s disconcerting is the desire to hide information from your own team,” said Andrew S. Weiss, who was a Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton. “The fact that Trump didn’t want the State Department or members of the White House team to know what he was talking with Putin about suggests it was not about advancing our country’s national interest but something more problematic.”The mystery surrounding the meetings seems to have drawn attention from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining ties between the president and Russia. And it has generated a furor in Congress, where Democrats are pushing to subpoena the notes of the president’s interpreters or perhaps the interpreters themselves.Veterans of past administrations could not recall a precedent for a president meeting alone with an adversary and keeping so many of his own advisers from being briefed on what was said. When they meet with foreign leaders, presidents typically want at least one aide in the room — not just an interpreter — to avoid misunderstandings later. Memorandums of conversation, called Memcons, are drafted and details are shared with officials who have reasons to know what was said.“All five of the presidents whom I worked for, Republicans and Democrats, wanted a word-for-word set of notes, if only to protect the integrity of the American side of the conversation against later manipulation by the Soviets or the Russians,” said Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat who worked for Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, among others.That would seem an even greater imperative for Mr. Trump, who knew there were questions about his relationship with Mr. Putin given that American intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow tried to help elect him.Every Time Trump Has Talked to PutinPresident Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have had at least five face-to-face meetings and nine publicly reported phone conversations since Mr. Trump won the election in 2016.“If any president would have wanted witnesses and protection, it ought to have been Donald Trump,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to four presidents, most recently as President George W. Bush’s State Department policy planning director. “And yet he chose not to, and that adds fuel to the fire that something here is not right.”Mr. Trump’s defenders acknowledge Mr. Trump’s approach does not resemble the way his predecessors operated, but note that he has been an unorthodox president in so many ways that it does not prove anything untoward. And, they say, he has reason to feel burned since previous interactions with foreign leaders have leaked, including full transcripts of telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia published in The Washington Post.“Of course I was disappointed with Helsinki, but I do not just look at how the president handles specific meetings with Putin,” said Luke Coffey, a foreign policy scholar at the Heritage Foundation. “Instead, I’m most interested in what the actual policies are coming out of the administration.”He cited additional sanctions, weapons sent to Ukraine, increased Pentagon spending meant to counter Russian aggression and opposition to a new Russian pipeline to Europe. All that, he said, “is proof that this is one of the toughest administrations on Russia since Reagan.”The question of Mr. Trump’s meetings with Mr. Putin was revived by a pair of news stories last weekend. The New York Times reported that after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director James B. Comey in 2017, the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation to explore whether the president was acting on Russia’s behalf. The Post reported that Mr. Trump had gone to unusual lengths to conceal details of his talks with Mr. Putin, including taking his interpreter’s notes.The White House dismissed the stories as unfair smears. “The liberal media has wasted two years trying to manufacture a fake collusion scandal instead of reporting the fact that unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.Mr. Trump has been in contact with Mr. Putin since shortly after his election in November 2016. Mr. Putin sent him a congratulatory telegram and the two spoke by telephone on Nov. 14.They spoke a few more times before meeting in person for the first time as presidents on July 7, 2017, in Hamburg, Germany, during a Group of 20, or G-20, economic summit meeting. Aside from interpreters, the only others in the room were Rex W. Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.ImageMr. Putin and Mr. Trump meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesThe inaugural meeting came at a sensitive time. Mr. Trump’s team learned that day that one of the biggest secrets of his presidential bid was about to become public: At the height of the campaign, his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman had met at Trump Tower with Russians on the promise of obtaining dirt on Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government. Mr. Trump’s team was scrambling to respond to a request for comment by The Times.Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Putin that day lasted more than two hours. Afterward, Mr. Trump took his interpreter’s notes and instructed the interpreter not to brief anyone. Mr. Tillerson told reporters that the leaders discussed everything from Syria to Ukraine, but he also described “a very robust and lengthy exchange” on the election hacking.A few hours later, Mr. Trump sought out Mr. Putin again during a dinner for all the leaders. Videotape later made public showed Mr. Trump pointing at Mr. Putin, who was seated across and down a long table, then pointing at himself and then making a pumping motion with his fist.Mr. Trump later told The Times that he went over to see his wife, Melania Trump, who was sitting next to Mr. Putin, and the two leaders then talked, with Mr. Putin’s interpreter translating. No American officials were present, and the White House did not confirm the encounter until more than 10 days later, after it was independently reported.The day after the two meetings, as Mr. Trump was on Air Force One taking off from Germany heading back to Washington, he telephoned a Times reporter and argued that the Russians were falsely accused of election interference. While he insisted most of the conversation be off the record, he later repeated a few things in public in little-noticed asides.He said that he raised the election hacking three times and that Mr. Putin denied involvement. But he said Mr. Putin also told him that “if we did, we wouldn’t have gotten caught because we’re professionals.” Mr. Trump said: “I thought that was a good point because they are some of the best in the world” at hacking.Asked how he weighed Mr. Putin’s denials against the evidence that had been presented to him by Mr. Comey; John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr., then director of national intelligence, he said that Mr. Clapper and Mr. Brennan were the “most political” intelligence chiefs he knew and that Mr. Comey was “a leaker.”Later on the same flight to Washington, Mr. Trump huddled with aides to decide how to respond to the emerging story by other Times reporters about the Trump Tower meeting. He personally dictated a misleading statement, saying the meeting was about Russian adoptions without admitting that it was actually intended to accept Moscow’s aid for his campaign, as emails obtained by The Times later documented.ImageMr. Trump and Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, last year.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe confluence of the two conversations with Mr. Putin even as Mr. Trump’s team was grappling with questions about the Trump Tower meeting have fueled further suspicions.“If you add up all these pieces, it’s a very damning picture at a minimum of how to handle national security,” said Mr. Weiss, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “If there’s a more nefarious explanation, it’s obviously more disturbing.”Mr. Trump next encountered Mr. Putin in person on Nov. 11, 2017, at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Da Nang, Vietnam. No formal meeting was scheduled, but the two chatted anyway, and Mr. Trump later indicated that Mr. Putin again denied any election interference. “I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Mr. Trump said.The two stayed in touch by phone. Mr. Trump called after Mr. Putin was re-elected in a contest heavily managed by the state in his favor. Although wary aides wrote in his briefing papers, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE,” Mr. Trump went ahead and congratulated Mr. Putin.Their most famous meeting came on July 16, 2018, in Helsinki, where they talked for more than two hours accompanied only by interpreters. At a subsequent news conference, Mr. Trump seemed to again accept Mr. Putin’s denial of election interference over the conclusions of American intelligence agencies.But what happened behind closed doors remained shrouded. The Kremlin later reported that the leaders reached important agreements, but American government officials were left in the dark. American intelligence agencies were left to glean details about the meeting from surveillance of Russians who talked about it afterward.Within months, Mr. Trump was angling for another meeting, perhaps at the White House or in Paris. Finally, they scheduled a get-together in Buenos Aires in December on the sidelines of another G-20 meeting.Days before, Russian forces seized three Ukrainian naval vessels, but Mr. Trump seemed intent on sitting down with Mr. Putin, telling reporters as he left the White House for Buenos Aires that the meeting was still on. Just an hour later, after aides briefed him again on Ukraine standoff, he canceled the meeting on Twitter, catching the Russians off guard.But when he arrived in Buenos Aires, Mr. Trump ended up having another informal conversation with Mr. Putin at the leaders’ dinner. Once again, little information emerged about what they discussed, even to many other American government officials.“I’ve never heard of a president conducting one-on-one meetings with his Russian counterpart without note-takers or without afterward offering readouts to his top aides,” said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state under Mr. Bush. “Putin is privy to what the two discussed — why can’t senior administration officials be trusted and looped in too?”David E.

Want this by email? Sign up here.The pain of the government shutdown is showingPresident Trump escalated the border wall fight in a televised speech last night, at the cost of leaving the government partly closed. He criticized political opponents for blocking the wall, although Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security measures like surveillance and fencing.The effects of the shutdown have begun to ripple across the economy, with mortgage applications delayed or canceled, public companies unable to complete deals and the well running dry for many federal employees.• Payday would have come this week for many of the 800,000 federal workers affected. With no paychecks on the way, their savings are evaporating and their credit cards are being maxed out.• The impasse is being felt elsewhere in the economy, including in home sales. Buyers are pulling out because of “economic uncertainty,” according to a National Association of Realtors survey. And closings are being delayed or canceled because customers’ mortgages were backed by federal agencies.• Several regulators are down to a skeleton staff, and companies are telling investors that their pending takeovers and stock sales could be delayed.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________ImageKim Jong-un with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Monday before leaving for Beijing.CreditKCNA, via KNS, via Associated PressCan U.S. negotiators trust China’s peace offerings?Trade talks in Beijing wrapped up today, as Chinese and American negotiators hurry to strike a deal before March, when the Trump administration has threatened to raise tariffs again.In recent weeks, the Chinese have made some concessions, resuming purchases of American soybeans, dropping retaliatory measures on U.S.-made cars. China has also offered to welcome more foreign investors and help limit forced transfer of overseas companies’ technology to Chinese businesses.Yesterday, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the discussions were “going very well!”But in Washington, many are sounding a note of caution: Are China’s promises too vague? Are they enforceable? One scholar described Beijing’s compromises as “a modest adjustment” when the U.S. and other countries want a “great leap in liberalization.”The Kim surprise:
Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, stepped off a train in Beijing yesterday to meet with President Xi Jinping, at the Chinese government’s invitation. China said the timing of his arrival was coincidental, but his presence was a reminder that the U.S. needs China’s cooperation to exert pressure on North Korea.Scheduling issues: The Trump administration has said that if negotiations fail, it will raise tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. But there are several other key dates in play.• Mr. Trump will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts Jan. 22. But the U.S. is reluctant to set up formal trade negotiations there, possibly because the president plans to use his State of the Union address, on Jan. 29, to demand broader powers to raise tariffs.• But China wants progress before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 4, which is generally preceded by a surge in consumer spending.China has reason to rush: The trade tensions are hurting its economy.• The World Bank said yesterday that Chinese growth would slow to 6.2 percent this year from 6.5 percent last year. Global growth is predicted to fall to 2.9 percent from 3 percent in 2018.• Corporate insolvencies are expected to increase faster in China than in any other major economy this year, growing by a fifth in 2019.• Chinese bond yields are at a two-year low. Its central bank loosened credit conditions five times in the past year.• Signs of progress in the talks drove markets higher in the U.S. yesterday and in Europe and Asia today.A reprieve for SearsThe struggling retailer reached a deal yesterday to stay alive after a flurry of last-minute negotiations, the NYT’s Michael Corkery writes. Sears’s chairman, Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who took control in 2005, now has the opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion bid for the company. He is expected to enter an official bid at a court-supervised auction next week.Sears’ largest creditors are in the driving seat, and they have two options. They can let Mr. Lampert try to maintain it as a “going concern” or force it to liquidate by selling all its real estate, inventory, intellectual property and other assets.Other retail news: In the first retail holiday update, J.C. Penney reported yesterday that adjusted comparable sales fell 3.5 percent during the crucial shopping period. The department store chain, based in Plano, Tex., also said it would close three stores and may announce more as its new chief executive, Jill Soltau, attempts a turnaround.ImageSumner Redstone in 2011 and Manuela Herzer in 2013.CreditAssociated PressSumner Redstone and his ex-girlfriend reach a truceThe media tycoon Sumner Redstone, 95, settled a long-running legal conflict with Manuela Herzer, writes Edmund Lee of the NYT. It was ostensibly focused on her right to his holdings, but it drew interest because of the salacious details it disclosed and the questions it raised about his mental state.Mr. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, run the private theater chain National Amusements, through which they control the CBS television network and a portfolio of companies at Viacom that include MTV and Paramount Pictures.Ms. Herzer, who is at least four decades younger than Mr. Redstone, had been named as a beneficiary of his will until he stripped her from the document in 2015 and forced her out of his mansion in Beverly Hills.Fallout from the ensuing court battle led Mr. Redstone to scale back his involvement in CBS and Viacom, and prompted a succession struggle that put his daughter at the top of the media empire.Court filings show that Ms. Herzer must now pay back $3.25 million in gifts and money received while she was Mr. Redstone’s companion.Dark days for Deutsche BankInvestment bankers at the embattled financial institution are steeling themselves for a double-digit cut to their bonus pool, according to the FT.Deutsche has been battered by bad news in the past year: Its stock price hit record lows, competitors are gobbling up its market share, and top-level employees are jumping ship as it fires thousands of others.

Will the Media Be Trump's Accomplice Again in 2020? - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSunday ReviewSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperSunday Review| Will the Media Be Trump's Accomplice Again in 2020?AdvertisementOpinionSupported by Will the Media Be Trump's Accomplice Again in 2020?We have a second chance. Let’s not blow it. By Frank BruniOpinion ColumnistJan. 11, 2019ImageCreditCreditBen Wiseman“Pocahontas” won’t be lonely for long.As other Democrats join Elizabeth Warren in the contest for the party’s presidential nomination, President Trump will assign them their own nicknames, different from hers but just as derisive. There’s no doubt. But how much heed will we in the media pay to this stupidity? Will we sprint to Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker or Mike Bloomberg for a reaction to what Trump just called one of them and then rush back to him for his response to that response? Or will we note Trump’s latest nonsense only briefly and pivot to matters more consequential?That’s a specific question but also an overarching one — about the degree to which we’ll let him set the terms of the 2020 presidential campaign, about our appetite for antics versus substance, and about whether we’ll repeat the mistakes that we made in 2016 and continued to make during the first stages of his presidency. There were plenty.Trump tortures us. Deliberately, yes, but I’m referring to the ways in which he keeps yanking our gaze his way. I mean the tough choices that he, more than his predecessors in the White House, forces us to make. His demand for television airtime on Tuesday night was a perfect example: We had to weigh a request in line with precedent against a president out of line when it comes to truth. We had to wrestle with — and figure out when and how to resist — his talent for using us as vessels for propaganda.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]We will wrestle with that repeatedly between now and November 2020, especially in the context of what may well be the most emotional and intense presidential race of our lifetimes. With the dawn of 2019 and the acceleration of potential Democratic candidates’ preparations for presidential bids, we have a chance to do things differently than we did the last time around — to redeem ourselves.Our success or failure will affect our stature at a time of rickety public trust in us. It will raise or lower the temperature of civic discourse, which is perilously hot. Above all, it will have an impact on who takes the oath of office in January 2021. Democracies don’t just get the leaders they deserve. They get the leaders who make it through whatever obstacle course — and thrive in whatever atmosphere — their media has created.“The shadow of what we did last time looms over this next time,” the former CBS newsman Dan Rather, who has covered more than half a century of presidential elections, told me. And what we did last time was emphasize the sound and the fury, because Trump provided both in lavish measure.“When you cover this as spectacle,” Rather said, “what’s lost is context, perspective and depth. And when you cover this as spectacle, he is the star.” Spectacle is his métier. He’s indisputably spectacular. And even if it’s a ghastly spectacle and presented that way, it still lets him control the narrative. As the writer Steve Almond observed in a recently published essay, “He appears powerful to his followers, which is central to his strongman mystique.”Trump was and is a perverse gift to the mainstream, establishment media, a magnet for eyeballs at a juncture when we were struggling economically and desperately needed one. Just present him as the high-wire act and car crash that he is; the audience gorges on it. But readers’ news appetite isn’t infinite, so they’re starved of information about the fraudulence of his supposed populism and the toll of his incompetence. And he wins. He doesn’t hate the media, not at all. He uses us.Did that dynamic help elect him? There’s no definitive answer. But we gave him an extraordinary bounty of coverage, depriving his rivals of commensurate oxygen and agency. And while our coverage of him had turned overwhelmingly negative by the final months of the 2016 campaign, it by no means started out that way.Thomas Patterson of Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy has been analyzing that coverage since Trump declared his candidacy for the presidency in 2015. Patterson found that for much of that year, the number of stories about Trump in the country’s most influential newspapers and on its principal newscasts significantly exceeded what his support in polls at the time justified.And those stories were predominantly positive. “The volume and tone of the coverage helped propel Trump to the top of Republican polls,” Patterson wrote in one of his reports about the election. In stark contrast, stories about Hillary Clinton in 2015 were mostly negative.Through the first half of 2016, as Trump racked up victories in the Republican primaries, he commanded much more coverage than any other candidate from either party, and it was evenly balanced between positive and negative appraisals — unlike the coverage of Clinton, which remained mostly negative.Only during their general-election face-off in the latter half of 2016 did Trump and Clinton confront equivalent tides of naysaying. “On topics relating to the candidates’ fitness for office, Clinton and Trump’s coverage was virtually identical in terms of its negative tone,” Patterson wrote. Regarding their fitness for office, they were treated identically? In retrospect, that’s madness. It should have been in real time, too.But we fell prey to a habit that can’t be repeated when we compare the new crop of Democratic challengers to Trump and to one another. We interpreted fairness as a similarly apportioned mix of complimentary and derogatory stories about each contender, no matter how different one contender’s qualifications, accomplishments and liabilities were from another’s. If we were going to pile on Trump, we had to pile on Clinton — or, rather, keep piling on her.“It was wall-to-wall emails,” said Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of The Times and the author of a book about the media, “Merchants of Truth,” that will be published next month. She was referring to the questions and complaints about Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “When you compare that to the wrongdoing that has been exposed so far by Robert Mueller,” Abramson told me, “it seems like a small thing.” The considerable muck in Clinton’s background never did, and never could, match the mountain of muck in Trump’s.Abramson, who had left The Times and was writing a column for The Guardian during the 2016 campaign, maintains that Trump also benefited from the media’s excessive faith in polls and its insufficient grasp of what was happening among Americans between the coasts. “The basic flaw of the press coverage, and I count myself in it, was the total assumption that Hillary would win,” she said. “The firepower of the investigative spotlight turned on Trump was a little bit less, because no one thought he would be the president, and that was a grave mistake.”ImageCreditBen WisemanI’m not certain that more firepower would have made a difference. For one thing, there were many exposés of Trump’s shady history. For another, he appealed to voters who largely disregard the mainstream media and who thrilled to his exhortations that they disregard it further. And many of those voters were embracing disruption or rejecting Clinton; the tally of Trump’s sins had little bearing on that. Regardless, he won’t get any pass along those lines in 2020. There are formal investigations galore into his behavior. The media needs only to track them — and is doing so, raptly.We need to do something else, too, which is to recognize that Trump now has an actual record in office and to discuss that with as much energy as we do his damned Twitter feed.By the time the 2020 election kicks into highest gear, Trump will have been president for more than three years, barring his impeachment, his resignation or his spontaneous combustion (with him, you never know). We’ll have evidence aplenty to demonstrate that he’s ineffective and incompetent, an approach more likely to have traction than telling voters that he’s outrageous. They already know that.We just have to wean ourselves from his Twitter expectorations, which are such easy, entertaining fuel for talking — or, rather, exploding — heads. I’ve certainly been powered by that fuel, in print and on television, myself. “You know what would be great?” said Amanda Carpenter, who worked as a communications adviser and speechwriter for Ted Cruz and wrote the 2018 book “Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us.” “Instead of covering Trump’s tweets on a live, breaking basis, just cover them in the last five minutes of a news show. They’re presidential statements, but we can balance them.”We can also allow his challengers to talk about themselves as much as they do about him. In 2016, Carpenter said, that didn’t happen. “It was deeply unfair,” she told me. “When the whole news cycle was microphones shoved in Republican candidates’ faces and the question was always, ‘What’s your reaction to what Trump just said?,’ there’s no way to drive your own message.”And when journalists gawp at each of Trump’s tirades, taunts and self-congratulatory hallucinations, these heresies blur together and he evades accountability for the ones that should stick. I asked Rather what he was most struck by in the 2016 campaign, and he instantly mentioned Trump’s horrific implication, in public remarks that August, that gun enthusiasts could rid themselves of a Clinton presidency by assassinating her.I’d almost forgotten it. So many lesser shocks so quickly overwrote it. Rather wasn’t surprised. “It got to the point where it was one outrage after another, and we just moved on each time,” he said. Instead, we should hold on to the most outrageous, unconscionable moments. We should pause there awhile. We can’t privilege the incremental over what should be the enduring. It lets Trump off the hook.So does anything, really, that tugs us from issues of policy and governance into the realms of theater and sport. That puts a greater premium than ever
on avoiding what Joel Benenson called “the horse-race obsession” with who’s ahead, who’s behind, who seems to be breaking into a gallop, who’s showing signs of a limp.Benenson was the chief strategist and pollster for Clinton’s campaign, and he told me: “Cable networks have figured out that the most interesting television of the week is the National Football League pregame show, and that if you put enough experts on arguing about something that hasn’t happened yet, people will watch. And that’s what we’re doing with our politics. The media is not using their strength, their franchise, to elevate and illuminate the conversation. They’re just getting you all jazzed up about the game.”That carried over into Trump’s presidency itself. To wit: Pew analyzed over 3,000 stories from 24 news organizations during his first four months in office to determine what the media gave the most coverage to. It wasn’t any legislative proposal or executive action such as the ban on travel into the United States from largely Muslim countries. It was his “political skills.”I think that we’ve improved since then, and all along our efforts have included significant in-depth reporting. The Times’s acquisition and exhaustive analysis of confidential financial records of Trump’s from the 1990s — and its conclusion, in an epic story published in October, that he used questionable schemes to build his wealth — is a sterling example.But the lure of less demanding labors (“Trump Calls Former Aide a Three-Toed Sloth Minus the Vigor!”) is always there, especially because readers and viewers, no matter how much they complain about the media’s shallowness, reward it. What they lap up most readily and reliably is Trump the Baby at the top of the newscast, Trump the Buffoon in the highlights reel, Trump the Bully in the headline. And that’s on them.But it’s on us to try to interest them in more and to leaven that concentration of attention with full, vivid introductions to Trump’s alternatives. Dozens of Democrats are poised to volunteer for that role, and when we in the media observe — as I myself have done — that they must possess the requisite vividness to steal some of his spotlight, we’re talking as much about our own prejudices and shortcomings as anything else. We can direct that spotlight where we want. It needn’t always fall on the politician juggling swords or doing back flips.It’s on us to quit staging “likability” sweepstakes — a prize more often withheld from female politicians than from male ones. We should buck commercial considerations to the extent that we can and give the candidates’ competing visions of government as much scrutiny as their competing talents for quips or proneness to gaffes. Every four years we say we’ll devote more energy and space to policy and every four years we don’t. But in an environment this polarized and shrill, and at a crossroads this consequential, following through on that vow is more important than ever.It’s on us not to surrender to tired taxonomies that worsen the country’s divisions and echo Trump’s divisiveness. Black voters, white voters, urban voters and rural voters aren’t driven solely by those designations, and the soul of the country doesn’t belong exclusively to former factory workers in the Rust Belt. “Their voices deserve to be heard, but so do the minority voices in urban America,” Rather said. “And I think we can do a better job as journalists not to overuse the phrase ‘average American,’ and also to expand the definition of it.”The real story of Trump isn’t his amorality and outrageousness. It’s Americans’ receptiveness to that. It’s the fact that, according to polls, most voters in November 2016 deemed him dishonest and indecent, yet plenty of them cast their ballots for him anyway.“Trump basically ran on blowing the whole thing up,” said Nancy Gibbs, who was the top editor at Time magazine from 2013 to 2017. “So what was it that the country wanted? It’s critically important that we find ways to get at what it is people imagine government should be doing and that we really look at what kind of leadership we need.”Nicknames have nothing to do with it.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|116th Congress Updates: House Approves Plan to Reopen Government, but It’s Not Likely to Pass SenateAdvertisementSupported by116th Congress Updates: House Approves Plan to Reopen Government, but It’s Not Likely to Pass SenateBy The New York TimesJan. 3, 2019• The 116th Congress, with the House in Democratic control, has come to order.• The House approved legislation to reopen the government.• Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, was elected speaker.• The House has begun changing its rules to reflect the Democrats’ new priorities.VideoRepresentative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, was elected speaker of the House. In her speech, Ms. Pelosi emphasized the significance of presiding over the most diverse group of lawmakers in U.S. history.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesHouse votes to reopen government. Measures pressure Senate.The House, with its new Democratic majority, passed two bills on Thursday night to reopen the government — one major spending bill to fund most shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30 and a stop-gap measure to restart the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks — without funding for a border wall.The measures are likely to go nowhere for now, but they will raise pressure on Republicans to come to the negotiating table. Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, two of the most endangered Republicans up for re-election in 2020, said they want a vote.But the White House formally notified Congress of the president’s intent to veto the legislation, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has said he will not put them to a vote without Mr. Trump’s support.The bills both have bipartisan stamps on them. The measure that would fund most of the government was assembled from six spending bills that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with broad support. It passed easily, 241-190, with seven Republicans voting yes. The stopgap measure, which passed 239-192 with a handful of Republicans crossing party lines, is similar to one that passed the Senate in December without dissent.— Emily CochraneHouse changes its rules to reflect Democratic priorities.The House on Thursday night approved the first part of a package of rules changes designed to improve order in the House chamber, ease introduction of bipartisan legislation and recognize the growing diversity among lawmakers. The other two parts are expected to be considered Friday and next week.The measure faced some opposition from the House’s most liberal members, particularly Representatives Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who objected to the inclusion of so-called pay-as-you-go provision, which requires all new spending to be offset by equal cuts or tax increases. Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and a prominent critic of Ms. Pelosi, argued that Republicans had not abided by such strictures of fiscal discipline, so Democrats shouldn’t impose a straitjacket on their ambitions. In the end, Mr. Ryan voted yes.“I just don’t think this is the time for us to tie our hands behind our back,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s a big issue for me after watching the Republicans erode a lot of these essential investments that we need to make.”But the inclusion of other provisions, including a rule that would force House lawmakers to be financially liable for discrimination settlements as well as sexual harassment settlements, made it difficult to vote no. The rules changes will also make it easier to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit by making a boost to the debt ceiling automatic with the passage of an annual budget.The package includes of priorities for Democratic lawmakers and members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that helped Ms. Pelosi secure the votes for speaker.It gives lawmakers 72 hours to read any bill before a vote. And it creates a select committee on climate change, a priority for several newly elected representatives. The package also changes traditional rules of decorum on the House floor to allow for religious head gear, a nod to Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the newly elected Democratic representative who wears a head scarf.— Emily CochraneDemocrats take control.Right on schedule, the House gaveled in for the 116th Congress, with Democrats now in control. The name plate wasn’t on the door of the Capitol’s sumptuous speaker’s suite yet, but Ms. Pelosi strode out of the speaker’s office toward the chamber, grandchildren in tow.Lawmakers and their children and grandchildren waved from the well of the House to family members seated in the galleries above. The press section was packed standing-room-only with journalists, and visitors clogged the hallways waiting their turn to go through full-body security scanners and take seats in the balcony overlooking the floor.Tony Bennett, who sang “I left my heart in San Francisco” at a dinner honoring Ms. Pelosi at the Italian embassy Wednesday night, was spotted in the visitors gallery, as was Mickey Hart, former drummer of the Grateful Dead.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Ms. Pelosi to be speaker, prompting a standing ovation from most of the Democratic side of the House and much of the spectators in the gallery.While some Republicans clapped, few if any stood during the multiple ovations during his glowing introduction of Ms. Pelosi.“House Democrats are down with N.D.P.,” Mr. Jeffries said, using Ms. Pelosi’s initials.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, received a standing ovation from her colleagues when she nominated Representative Kevin McCarthy to be speaker.Ms. Cheney referenced Mr. McCarthy’s efforts in working to secure border-wall funding — “yes, Madam Clerk, build the wall” — in a nod to the ongoing government shutdown, which is at an impasse over the demand to fund the wall at the southwestern border. While Republicans stood, no Democrats acknowledged the remark.[When the House and the Senate Are Controlled by Different Parties, Who Wins?]The speaker’s roll-call.ImageMembers of the 116th Congress, mostly Republicans on the left and mostly Democrats on the right.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesJust before 1 p.m., the House began its roll-call vote to elect a new speaker, with each member calling out the name of his or her preferred candidate. Most Democrats were voting for Ms. Pelosi, while most Republicans voted for Mr. McCarthy, but there were defectors on each side.A handful of freshmen Democrats voted for others. Representative Anthony Brindisi voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, while Jason Crow voted for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, bouncing his baby boy as he spoke, voted for Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois. Representative Jim Cooper, a longtime detractor of Ms. Pelosi, voted “present.”Representative Ben McAdams of Utah voted for Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida. Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania voted for Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III. Representative Kathleen Rice of New York, one of the leading anti-Pelosi rebels, voted for Stacey Abrams, the failed Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia.Three freshmen with national security backgrounds, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, voted against her as well. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey simply voted present.Republicans had their own defectors. Representative Justin Amash voted for Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky.Technically, photos and videos are prohibited on the floor of the house chamber. But that didn’t stop a number of members from documenting the historic vote.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, posted a video on Twitter of her vote. And Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, could be seen taking a selfie with Ms. Pelosi and a handful of other women members on the Democratic side of the chamber.The dissentersImageA Republican Congressman tallied votes for speaker.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMs. Pelosi suffered more than a dozen defections, mainly from freshmen who won their Republican districts in part by pledging to oppose her as speaker.Freshmen who did not vote for Ms. Pelosi: Anthony Brindisi of New York, Jason Crow of Colorado, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah, Max Rose of New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jared Golden of Maine.Defector serving his first full term: Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania.Opponents with more experience in the House: Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Kathleen Rice of New York.The final tally: Ms. Pelosi — 220; Mr. McCarthy — 192; Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio — 5, Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat of Illinois — 4; Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois — 2; Stacey Abrams of Georgia — 1; Joseph R. Biden Jr. — 1; Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio — 1; Representative Joseph p. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts — 1; Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia — 1; Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky — 1; Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — 1; Present — 3.And the G.O.P. keeps its political foil.Republicans and their well-financed political arms have for years campaigned against Ms. Pelosi as an out-of-touch, elitist San Francisco liberal, tying every sort of Democratic candidate to her. In 2018, it didn’t work.But with her second election as speaker, the biggest Republican super PAC — and the one that arguably tried hardest to tie Democratic candidates to Ms. Pelosi — practically celebrated. The Congressional Leadership Fund put Democrats on notice:“Democratic candidates spent the last two years promising voters that they’d be different — they wouldn’t stand for the same old leadership and the same old way of doing business in Washington. Yet with the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them. CLF will make sure voters know that their member of Congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch San Francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.”The National Republican Congressional Committee blitzed out text messages to voters in 15 districts that flipped from Republican to Democrat, announcing the new Democratic member had voted for Ms. Pelosi after saying he or she wouldn’t. “Fight back NOW!”Republicans appear determined to keep Ms. Pelosi’s speakership — and the Democratic House — limited to two years.The new Senate is also being sworn in — still in G.O.P. control.On the other side of the Capitol, the scene was more subdued as Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to more than 30 new senators, who raised their right hands and signed their names one by one into the public record.ImageListen: Chuck Schumer on the Wall, the Shutdown and the Era of Divided GovernmentOn the eve of a new Congress, the Senate minority leader sat down with “The Daily” to discuss his hopes — and his strategy for getting things done — before the next election rolls around.“Do you solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God?” Mr. Pence asked each senator.The freshly elected and re-elected senators were young — the youngest, Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is 39 — and old — the oldest, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is 85. Several are former members of the House. One, Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the Republicans’ presidential nominee in 2012 and has already earned Mr. Trump’s ire for his independent streak.In total, the new class gives Republicans a slightly more durable majority, 53 to 47, in the upper chamber.— Nicholas FandosIn an interview, Pelosi also raises impeachment.VideoFor more than 15 years, Representative Nancy Pelosi has been a powerhouse fund-raiser for her party and a lightning rod for the right. Here’s how she’s done it.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesEven before she was elected speaker, Ms. Pelosi on Thursday morning started a historic day with a left hook, suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted. She made the comments in an interview with the “Today” show on NBC, when the host, Savannah Guthrie, asked if she agreed that the Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president should be honored by the special counsel, who is investigating whether President Trump’s campaign colluded with Russians seeking to put him in the White House.[With the gavel in hand, she will cement her status as the highest-ranking and most powerful elected woman in American political history. Read our profile of Ms. Pelosi.]“I do not think that that is conclusive,” she said. “No, I do not. I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.”For good measure, she warned her left flank that the House would not move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump, but she did not take impeachment off the table.“We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,” she said. “We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we’ll just have to see how it comes.”— Maggie HabermanTrump keeps up his attacks.Mr. Trump claimed on Thursday that the government shutdown, now in its 13th day with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, was “only because of the 2020 presidential election.”The House will vote this evening on two bills to reopen the government, one to fund the Department of Homeland Security into February — but without funding for a border wall, which Mr. Trump demands — and another to fund the rest of the shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30.But with House action coming, Mr. Trump is keeping up blame game.— Emily CochraneA new Congress, a whole new look.ImageMembers of Congress taking photos before being sworn in to the 116th Congress on Thursday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesSwearing-in day is a time for lawmakers to make statements about themselves. Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, Ms. Omar, and Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, did so with their attire.Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress (the other is Ms. Omar), wore her mother’s thobe — a traditional Palestinian dress — on the House floor. Her decision attracted attention on Twitter, with a hashtag #TweetYourThobe, encouraging Palestinian women around the country to tweet photos of themselves wearing thobes.Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee who wears a hijab, or head covering, became the first person to do so on the House floor. She has worked with Democratic leadership to carve out a religious exemption to a 181-year old rule barring hats of any type — a move that has drawn criticism from an evangelical pastor who complained she would make the House floor “look like an Islamic Republic.” The Orthodox Union, an umbrella group representing Orthodox Jews, supports the move.Ms. Haaland, who is one of two of the first Native American women to join the House, wore traditional Pueblo dress — including silver and turquoise jewelry and moccasins.— Sheryl Gay StolbergIncoming speaker hails a “transformative” freshman class.ImageMs. Pelosi celebrated after being elected speaker.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesShowing her trademark confidence, Ms. Pelosi has already released excerpts from the speech she plans to give when she wins the speaker’s gavel — assuming she will win an election against the Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. (The Democrats have 235 members to Republicans’ 199.)On an incoming freshman class that is historically female and remarkably diverse:“When our new Members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our Democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative Freshman Class. Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.”On growing income disparity, as the rich grow richer and the rest struggle to keep afloat:“We must end that injustice and restore the public’s faith in a better future for themselves and their children. We must be champions of the middle class, and all those who aspire to it — because the middle class is the backbone of democracy.”On climate change, an issue that she failed to legislate on the last time she was speaker — with disastrous political results:“We must also face the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis — a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions. The entire Congress must work to put an end to the inaction and denial of science that threaten the planet and the future. This is a public health decision for clean air and clean water; an economic decision for America’s global pre-eminence in green technology; a security decision to keep us safe; and a moral decision to be good stewards of God’s creation.”ImageMembers of Congress and their families before being sworn in.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesIn a diverse House, the first quadriplegic member will preside on Day 1.Representative Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, a veteran Democrat and the first quadriplegic elected to Congress, will have the honor of presiding over the first session of the 116th Congress — and the opening debate over how to reopen the government.In a new House that includes the first two Muslim women, the first two Native American women and a slew of other diversity firsts, Ms. Pelosi turned to the 54-year-old New Englander, who has been in the House since 2001.“As Speaker, when America marked the 20th anniversary of the landmark, bipartisan Americans with Disabilities Act, it was my honor to implement changes to our institution to make it possible for our colleagues with disabilities to preside over the House,” Ms. Pelosi said, announcing her decision. “Now, it is my great honor and joy to build on that progress by selecting Congressman Jim Langevin to serve as the first Speaker Pro Tempore of the new Congress. Together, we are proudly reaffirming a fundamental truth: that in our nation, we respect people for what they can do, not judge them for what they cannot do.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Related CoverageNancy Pelosi Elected Speaker as Democrats Take Control of HouseJan. 3, 2019ImageNancy Pelosi, Icon of Female Power, Will Reclaim Role as Speaker and Seal a Place in HistoryJan. 2, 2019ImageAs Pelosi Takes Over, an Attempt to Revive the ‘Lost Art’ of Legislating Jan. 2, 2019ImageShow AllAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWho’s Running for President in 2020? - The New York Times

They are thinking. Weighing. And, in many cases, already campaigning.
It can feel as if half the Democratic Party is setting off on a White House run. In fact, it’s only 18 or so, officially. And the number is growing. The next couple weeks could pad the field even more, to say nothing of the handful of Republicans primed to join the pack. Below, an accounting of who’s in, who’s out and who’s somewhere in between.
Running
Cory Booker, 49
Senator from New Jersey; former mayor of Newark
Democrat
“I believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind … where we see the faces of our leaders on television and feel pride, not shame.”
Would be one of the most gifted orators in the field, running on a politics of uplift that could recall President Obama’s 2008 campaign.
Enjoys a vast fund-raising base, thanks to longstanding connections to donors around the country.
Signature issues: Has been one of the leaders in the Senate on criminal justice reform, but his appeal would most likely center on his call to unify the country.
Pete Buttigieg, 37
Mayor of South Bend, Ind.; military veteran
Democrat
“I launched a presidential exploratory committee because it is a season for boldness and it is time to focus on the future.”
Began to draw national notice after delivering an essay that counseled Democrats on how to recover from their defeats in the 2016 elections.
Has embarked on a long-shot campaign that may test the appeal of a youthful profile over more traditional qualifications.
Signature issues: Has stressed his generational identity and called for policies on issues like climate change and economic opportunity.
Julián Castro, 44
Former housing secretary; former mayor of San Antonio
Democrat
“I’m running for president because it’s time for new leadership. Because it’s time for new energy.”
Opted out of challenging Senator Ted Cruz for the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections.
Once a rising political star, has struggled to find a role during the Trump administration.
Money could be an issue, especially if former Representative Beto O’Rourke, a small donor magnet, also mounts a bid.
Signature issues: Has emphasized a platform of universal prekindergarten, “Medicare for all” and immigration reform.
John Delaney, 55
Former congressman from Maryland; former businessman
Democrat
“I think I’m the right person for the job, but not enough people knew who I was or still know who I am.”
Was elected to the House in 2012 as a “pragmatic idealist,” in his telling.
Has been running aggressively since 2017.
Has already visited every county in Iowa, though it’s unclear if he has improved his long-shot prospects.
Signature issues: Has pitched himself as a bipartisan problem-solver, but has also endorsed liberal causes like universal health care.
Tulsi Gabbard, 37
Congresswoman from Hawaii; Army National Guard veteran
Democrat
“There are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I’m concerned about and that I want to help solve.”
Supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries.
Has drawn condemnation for meeting with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, whose regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians.
Has apologized for her history of anti-gay statements and her past work for an anti-gay advocacy group.
Signature issue: Opposition to American military intervention overseas, including in countries like Syria.
Kirsten Gillibrand, 52
Senator from New York; former congresswoman
Democrat
“I’m going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom I am going to fight for other people’s kids as hard as I would fight for my own.”
Was once a congresswoman from a conservative House district (with policy positions to match).
Has transformed herself into a progressive champion in President Trump’s Washington, becoming one of the Senate’s leading liberal voices.
Signature issue: Has long placed women’s equality and opportunity at the center of her policy agenda.
Kamala Harris, 54
Senator from California; former attorney general of California; former San Francisco district attorney
Democrat
“I believe our country wants and needs some leadership that provides a vision of the country in which everyone could see themselves.”
Would bring a star power and history-making potential to the race that few other Democrats can match.
One of few new Democrats to join the Senate after 2016.
Quickly drew notice for her tough questioning of Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees — and later, his Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Signature issues: Unveiled middle-class tax cut legislation last fall, and has championed a liberal civil rights agenda in the Senate.
John Hickenlooper, 67
Former governor of Colorado; former mayor of Denver
Democrat
“I’ve proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.”
A political moderate with a record of success in a purple state.
A former geologist who struck it rich when he opened a brewery in Denver.
Will probably cast himself as someone who can attract support from a broad coalition, though some of his victories entailed cutting deals with the Republican business establishment.
Signature issues: Has stressed his record of consensus-building around issues like expanding Medicaid, gay rights and gun control.
Jay Inslee, 68
Governor of Washington State; former congressman
Democrat
“I’m running for president because I am the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation’s No. 1 priority.”
A two-term governor known for his environmental policies.
Has become one of the party’s most forceful climate advocates, calling on Democrats to embrace a green-energy jobs program.
Signature issues: Has made climate a centerpiece of his agenda as governor and as a national figure, campaigning widely in the midterm elections on a message of creating renewable energy jobs.
Amy Klobuchar, 58
Senator from Minnesota; former Hennepin County, Minn., attorney
Democrat
“It is time to organize, time to galvanize, time to take back our democracy.”
Became a hero to many Democrats for her stern, cool questioning of Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.
Has called for Democrats to focus on reclaiming the swing states in the middle of the country.
Signature issues: Has championed legislation to combat the opioid crisis and drug addiction, and to address the cost of prescription drugs.
Wayne Messam, 44
Mayor of Miramar, Fla.; former college football champion
Democrat
“America belongs to all of us. The promise of America belongs to all of us. That’s why I’m going to be running for president. To be your champion.”
Defeated a long-time incumbent to become his city’s first black mayor.
Has taken progressive stances on guns, immigration and environmental issues.
A first-generation American born to Jamaican parents, he is hoping to tap into the Caribbean-American community to help fuel his long-shot bid.
Signature issue: Has proposed canceling the more than $1.5 trillion in student debt owed by 44 million Americans.
Beto O’Rourke, 46
Former congressman from Texas; 2018 Senate candidate
Democrat
“This is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us, that seeks to unite a divided country.”
Became a celebrity of Democratic politics in the Trump age, and narrowly lost to Senator Ted Cruz in 2018.
Has delivered a message of national unity and red-state liberalism via constant social media livestreaming to voters inside and outside Texas.
Any success in 2020 would draw from this viral appeal, particularly to younger Democrats, and from the small-dollar fund-raising army it has earned him.
Signature issues: Has focused on immigration reform, marijuana legalization and rural hospital access.
Tim Ryan, 45
