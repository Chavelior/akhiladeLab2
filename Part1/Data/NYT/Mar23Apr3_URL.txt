CreditCreditJoshua Lott for The New York TimesOne clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that President Trump and his fellow Republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground.Take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, states that provided the Electoral College votes crucial to Trump’s capture of the White House.John C. Austin, the director of the Michigan Economic Center and a senior fellow at Brookings, analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year — 12 from Republican to Democrat, three from Democrat to Republican — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa.Austin found a striking pattern. In the majority of districts that went from Republican to Democrat:Residents had incomes higher than statewide medians, as well as higher educational attainment — in most places by considerable margins. Conversely, in the three districts that moved from blue to red, incomes and educational attainment lagged statewide figures.The accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts.Where Voters Are Trending BlueIndustrial-state House districts that changed from Republican to Democratic representation in 2018 tended to be economically better off than their states overall. Figures are the difference between median district income and statewide median income among districts that changed parties.

By The New York Times | Source: analysis of 2017 American Community Survey data by John Austin for BrookingsThe same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms.In September 2018, Siobhan Hughes and Dante Chinni of The Wall Street Journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the Cook Political Report. They then ranked the races on the basis of an “economic-health index created by the Institute of International Finance.”Of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health, eight were categorized “lean Republican” by the Cook Political Report, and two “lean Democrat.” Before the November election, nine of those 10 seats were held by Republicans.On Election Day, Democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts.Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, both of Brookings, worked with John Harwood of CNBC to analyze Democratic and Republican-held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election. Their conclusions reinforce the findings of Austin, Hughes and Chinni.The key result: the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by Democrats, while Republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous, measured by share of G.D.P. The accompanying chart illustrates their analysis.Rich District, Poor DistrictThe most economically productive U.S. House districts are led by Democrats. Most of the poorest 20 districts voted Republican.

By The New York Times | Source: Brookings analysis of data from Emsi, the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe authors’ calculation of the contribution to the G.D.P. of every congressional district showed that Democratic districts produce $10.2 trillion of the nation’s goods and services and Republican districts $6.2 trillion.This trend creates a significant dilemma for Trump and the Republican Party. Candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections, they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn. Electorally speaking, in other words, Republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline.Let’s return to John Austin of the Michigan Economic Center. In an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly: “A rising economic tide tends to sink the Trump tugboat,” adding“Certainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned, not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and ‘blaming others’ for people’s woes (like immigrants and people of color) that fuel Trump’s supporters.”In June 2017, Austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the Republican Party. His study of the 2016 presidential results in the Midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help Republicans. In that earlier report, Austin wrote:The small- and medium-sized factory towns that dot the highways and byways of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin have lost their anchor employers and are struggling to fill the void. Many of these communities, including once solidly Democratic-voting, union-heavy, blue collar strongholds, flipped to Trump in 2016.This pattern is not limited to the United States. There are numerous studies demonstrating that European and British voters who are falling behind in the global economy, and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state, drove Brexit as well as the rise of right-wing populist parties.One paper, “Measuring the Effects of Economic Austerity on Pro-Sociality: Evidence from Greece,” by Nicholas Sambanis, Anna Schultz and Elena Nikolova, political scientists at Penn, Duke and University College London, found, for example,A strong relationship between job loss and decreased generalized solidarity. We find evidence of in-group bias and the bias becomes more pronounced due to exposure to austerity policies.In a July 2018 paper, “Did Austerity Cause Brexit?” Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right-wing populist party UKIP in Britain and to voter approval of Brexit.These political movements “are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010,” Fetzer writes. Examination of economic trends, welfare policy and polling data shows, according to Fetzer, thatthe EU referendum (Brexit) could have resulted in a Remain victory had it not been for a range of austerity-induced welfare reforms. These reforms activated existing economic grievances. Further, auxiliary results suggest that the underlying economic grievances have broader origins than what the current literature on Brexit suggests. Up until 2010, the UK’s welfare state evened out growing income differences across the skill divide through transfer payments. This pattern markedly stops from 2010 onward as austerity started to bite.There are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against Brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country.In a separate 2017 paper, “Who Voted For Brexit,” Fetzer and two fellow economists at the University of Warwick, Sascha O. Becker and Dennis Novy, found that “in particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent U.K. austerity program are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share.” This heldall across the board: more deprivation is tightly associated with a larger Vote Leave share or, vice versa; less deprivation is tightly associated with a lower Vote Leave share.The results here and in England reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get, the better the right does.As a rule, as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure, they become more generous and more liberal. In the United States, this means that voters move to the left; in Britain, it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the European Union.In his forthcoming book, “Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics” Carles Boix, a political scientist at Princeton, describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid-1970s led to a liberal international consensus:In light of the historical experience of advanced countries, embracing the program of embedded liberalism made economic and political sense. Twentieth-century democratic capitalism had proved to be both successful and resilient: it had delivered high growth; it had allowed governments to fund generous social programs; and it had sent its main political and economic competitor — communism — to the ash heap of history.As global competition, outsourcing and later, automation, began to produce significant economic disruption, beginning in the 1970s, this liberal consensus frayed.Boix writes,The structure of electoral participation became strongly polarized across the Atlantic — very much in line with the economic transformations brought about by the decline of industry and by globalization in the last forty years.In the United States, economic adversity helped produce Trump, whose inaugural speech (reportedly the handiwork of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller) Boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism:For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left. And the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now.Together, the trends described above raise an intriguing question: If the Republican Party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind, does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline?I asked scholars and officials at the Niskanen Center — a Washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division — whether they thought the Republican Party has come to recognize that prosperity helps Democrats, while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants, resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban America. Does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline?Jerry Taylor, president of Niskanen, replied to my inquiry by making the case that “as conservatives see it, the more visible government dysfunction is, the better. It provides civic education.”Working from this premise, Taylor argued that as far as conservatives go,anything that dispels the illusion that government can be harnessed for positive ends is generally a good thing, and anything that reduces its power and scope is a salutary development.Taylor disputed the suggestion that “Republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white America.” Instead, he said, they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth isonly reliably ensured when government is minimized, taxes are nearly inconsequential, and free markets and property rights are given the greatest scope possible. Marry that with their belief that a rising economic tide will lift all boats, and you can quickly see why they’re at a loss to explain what’s going on in rural America.Will Wilkinson, the center’s vice president for research, wrote back to me:The G.O.P.’s success in struggling places has given them a false impression that voters who live there will stay faithful as long as they keep feeding them culture-war chum. Trump’s populism offered a false but compelling diagnosis of their economic problems, immigrants and insufficiently protectionist trade policy, which dovetails neatly with rural white anxieties about declining cultural status and relative political power. If you can align threats to identity with threats to material security, as Trump did, it’s pretty powerful.But, in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing, Wilkinson continued, Trump’strade war is positively hurting agriculture and manufacturing, and every Republican member of congress has voted multiple times to strip away health benefits — leaving ‘identity threat’ as the party’s last resort.What’s more, Wilkinson noted,Identity threat — ‘I don’t recognize this country anymore’ — is very abstract compared to material threat — ‘my daughter with leukemia will die if they don’t cover pre-existing conditions’ — and far less motivating. And the argument that the G.O.P. establishment itself has become a threat to economic/material welfare has started to become persuasive.This has put the Republican Party in a painful position, according to Wilkinson:It’s going to get worse for the G.O.P. as the urgency of the economic problems grows. But they just don’t understand that pushing the same button over and over isn’t going to have the same effect. And this is so in part because they don’t really want to see the seriousness of economic divergence, because they have no idea what to do about it that is remotely consistent with Zombie Reagan social policy dogma.Brink Lindsey, vice president for policy, replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle: “You don’t need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain Republican governance failures.”In Lindsey’s view,it starts in ideological self-delusion — that government is simply incapable of performing well, so starving it of funds is always a good idea and trying to make it work better is a waste of time. The problem starts there, as I said, but it doesn’t end there, as these attitudes can very easily merge into cynical, lazy indifference to public administration and onward to outright venality and corruption. And, of course, this ideological stance turns out to be incredibly convenient for rich donors looking for any excuse to keep their taxes down.This is not, according to Lindsey,a conspiracy, but rather a rotten equilibrium. Lack of trust in government brings charlatans to power, further reducing trust in government and widening the path to power for future charlatans.In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the Republican Party’s “rotten equilibrium.”The first, of course, is Trump himself. His victory in 2016 was a charlatan’s ascent, and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government — fuel, in one sense, for the continued success of charlatans. For the moment, though, his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force.Trump’s second, if less heralded, achievement has been to invigorate the Democratic opposition. He has inspired an immense, rambunctious, intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates — some prepared, some less so, to dislodge him from the White House.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Thomas B.

Congress needs a full accounting of his misdeeds to ensure they don’t happen again.By Jerrold L. NadlerMr. Nadler is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.April 1, 2019ImageCreditCreditMatt ChaseLast Sunday, Attorney General William Barr sent us a letter summarizing what he says are the “principal conclusions” of the special counsel, Robert Mueller. The next day, together with five other committee chairmen, I wrote back to the attorney general, demanding that he provide us with the full Mueller report — not a summary, but the full report and all of the relevant evidence — by April 2.For nearly two years, the country has waited to read the report. Over those many months, President Trump has raged against the institutions that make our democracy possible — among them, the free press, the courts and his own Department of Justice. When the special counsel indicted members of the president’s inner circle, his attacks got louder.Before the formal investigation began, Mr. Trump fired his F.B.I. director. He later fired his attorney general. He reportedly attempted to fire the special counsel himself. Despite this profoundly unacceptable behavior, the special counsel persevered and wrote his report.We — the members of the Judiciary Committee, the House of Representatives and the entire American public — are still waiting to see that report. We will not wait much longer. We have an obligation to read the full report, and the Department of Justice has an obligation to provide it, in its entirely, without delay. If the department is unwilling to produce the full report voluntarily, then we will do everything in our power to secure it for ourselves. The entire reason for appointing the special counsel was to protect the investigation from political influence. By offering us his version of events in lieu of the report, the attorney general, a recent political appointee, undermines the work and the integrity of his department. He also denies the public the transparency it deserves. We require the full report — the special counsel’s words, not the attorney general’s summary or a redacted version.We require the report, first, because Congress, not the attorney general, has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred. The special counsel declined to make a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” on the question of obstruction, but it is not the attorney general’s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel’s. That responsibility falls to Congress — and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee — as it has in every similar investigation in modern history. The attorney general’s recent proposal to redact the special counsel’s report before we receive it is unprecedented. We require the evidence, not whatever remains after the report has been filtered by the president’s political appointee.On its face, the attorney general’s letter raises more questions than it answers. He tells us, for instance, that he declined to charge the president with obstruction in part because there was no underlying crime to obstruct. Did he discuss that conclusion with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — who, while a federal prosecutor, routinely charged individuals with obstruction without charging the underlying crime? Did the attorney general forget that the special counsel indicted 37 other people, including the president’s campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser, for various crimes, including conspiracy against the United States? Did he lose track of his own prosecutors, who effectively named the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Southern District of New York?Second, we require the report because Congress has a role that is fundamentally different from that of the Department of Justice. The special counsel’s mandate was narrow: investigate allegedly criminal conduct stemming from links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Our job is to hold the president accountable any time he undermines the rule of law, and is not limited to his involvement with the Russian government during the campaign.Whether or not the president could have been charged with a crime, even the attorney general acknowledges the existence of evidence that has so far been hidden from view. We have every reason to suspect that the unedited obstruction section of the Mueller report resembles the report that Congress received from the Watergate grand jury in 1974. That evidence showed that President Richard Nixon had attempted to obstruct justice. It did not recommend that the president should be prosecuted. It did not say the president should be impeached. It simply stated the evidence so that Congress could do its job.Finally, we require the report because one day, one way or another, the country will move on from President Trump. We must make it harder for future presidents to behave this way. We need a full accounting of the president’s actions to do that work. When the full scope of the president’s misconduct has been revealed, when his lies are debunked and his abuses have been laid bare, I believe that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will draft legislation to curb the worst of his offenses. Put another way: If President Trump’s behavior wasn’t criminal, then perhaps it should have been.RelatedMore on the Mueller report.

Did we all blow it out of proportion?ross douthatYeah I mean, my response is short and sweet: No collusion!

Trump himself is feeling vindicated. Which raises the question is the Trump Russia story less of a big deal than Democrats, national security officials, the media and many others have made it out to be? Ross, Michelle and I are going to talk about that. We’re gonna have some sharp disagreements about Mueller today and I hope they will help you clarify your own thoughts. I’m going to go first briefly and answer that question with a, “Yes, but.” I do think the expectations for the Mueller report got a little out of hand, including my own. Based on what we know so far Mueller seems to have found less evidence of a relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia than many people expected. But the caveat is also important which is that Mueller uncovered a lot of criminal and unpatriotic behavior by Trump’s inner circle. And I’m really reluctant to draw final conclusions until we’ve seen the actual Mueller report not the four page summary written by William Barr who is after all a Trump appointee. Michelle why don’t you go next. Are you suffering from Mueller disappointment syndrome?michelle goldbergSo it’s not that I’m suffering from Mueller disappointment syndrome. I am absolutely enraged at the way that this is all being spun and covered by much of the media. I mean I just cannot believe what I am watching happening and the amount of gaslighting and misinformation. You know and as you know I kind of objected to this framing for the show, right? I thought that the question should be has Trump been exonerated? With the answer being obviously not. So just to back up, I mean, you guys remember — maybe you remember — a few months ago I said that my feeling about this has always been summarized by the Passover song, “Dayenu,” which means it would have been enough. And that’s really how I feel about Trump being a traitor who should be impeached. So what I hoped for the Mueller Report was not that it would reveal that Trump is even worse than I believe him to be. I did have hope that it would convince Republicans to finally show at least like a modicum of patriotism in forcing them to stand up to him. And obviously that’s not happened and in fact they’ve sort of now doubled down on their misinformation and we’re now in a country where our two competing realities are so dug in and solidified that it almost feels like there’s no way back for us as a nation. But people always said well he might not find conspiracy which is the crime but we can expect that he’ll probably find obstruction. And so it looks like what happened — although we don’t know — is that he released this report. He didn’t find evidence of a crime or at least he didn’t find evidence that rose to the level of being able to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. He found significant evidence of obstruction of justice but decided not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, presumably because of the DOJ regulations that say a sitting president can’t be prosecuted. And they spun this so well by kind of releasing this highly tendentious summary written by an attorney general handpicked for the purpose of covering this thing up. They released this thing. He kind of says well I’ve concluded there’s no obstruction of justice. They start screaming, “Exoneration!” Even though the report specifically says it does not exonerate Trump and sort of the whole media has this kind of whiplash and they’re still bullied by the belligerence of the right that they kind of go along with this narrative that none of us have any idea if it’s supported by the underlying documents.ross douthatMy response is is short and sweet: No collusion! [LEONHARDT LAUGHS] Witch hunt! That’s all I got.david leonhardtThat’s it?ross douthatI’m totally vindicated.michelle goldbergRoss, I am angrier at you than usual today.david leonhardtRoss, I was going to congratulate you on having been somewhat prescient but you’re not really putting me in the mood to congratulate you.ross douthatNo collusion! No collusion! Witch hunt! That’s all. Alright, no, I’ll make an argument. So look I wrote a column where I stole an argument from Matt Taibbi who is a sort of left-wing, angry, muckraking gadfly of a journalist who wrote a long piece over the weekend arguing that the way the media covered the Russia controversy — Russiagate, l’affaire russe, whatever you want to call it — was way worse than the way they covered W.M.D. in Iraq. And in channeling this argument I disagreed with it a little bit. I think comparing Russiagate to the W.M.D. controversy sort of founders on the fact that the Russiagate controversy has not actually led us into a war with Russia, happily, whereas the W.M.D. controversy did lead us into an actual mostly disastrous war. But I think the comparison is useful and I think you can see why it’s useful in the way Michelle made her argument. Which is that, you know, after it turned out that there really weren’t any W.M.D. in Iraq and that Saddam Hussein was not actually masterminding a conspiracy with Al Qaeda, people who supported the Iraq War would fall back and say, “Well look, O.K., there weren’t WMD. And Saddam wasn’t in bed with Al Qaeda. But he was a horrible dictator who gassed his own people and was a source of regional instability and there were still all kinds of reasons why he should have been removed from power and why the Iraq War was a good idea.” And that was all fine but it was still the case that there was this huge amount of media coverage and political argument pinning a huge amount of emphasis on these claims that Saddam had W.M.D. and maybe was working with Al Qaeda. And all of that turned out to be false. And in a similar way, yes, of course Michelle is right. There remain all kinds of reasons to think that Donald Trump is a bad person who behaved badly with regard to Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and that he should not be president. But it remains the case that a huge amount of media attention, statements by former national security officials, by former heads of the intelligence community, endless coverage on MSNBC was all premised on the idea that this was going to end with evidence of serious sustained collaboration of some kind between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence. And that’s not true. So it’s a big deal that it’s not true.michelle goldbergSo even a lot of the kind of maximalist versions of the Russiagate story which are not just that Trump was actively collaborating but that he was — the other version of that is that he was sort of compromised and being manipulated. And even that version, that he’s compromised and being manipulated, nothing in the Barr letter rules that out at all. In part because being compromised and manipulated is not necessarily a crime that would be part of the counter-intelligence part of this probe, about which we still know basically nothing. The final thing I want to say is that what really reminds me of the Iraq War is that there was such belligerence among pro-war proponents. There was this sort of like concentrated onslaught, it was kind of an information onslaught, although it was pre-social media, that it kind of knocked you off balance. Right? Particularly if you’re a liberal, if you’re the sort of person that always assumes that truth is elusive and that other people might have a point. And I remember, you know, I was in my 20s then feeling discombobulated, right? Like maybe all these people who are so sure are right and that’s what this campaign reminds me of. This like relentless like, “When are you going to apologize?” You know that’s what it feels like.ross douthatBut so and I mean I guess, you know, this is — we can’t resolve this perfectly and I do want to say that of course you’re right, that it is completely possible that there is material in the actual Mueller report that will make the Barr letter look like a lawyered up document that concealed some realities. With that being said, I think it’s generally unlikely that Robert Mueller, who knows what’s in his own report, who has known Barr for a long time, and who has shown a perfect willingness to correct the record at various points in the past, would sort of willingly let himself be played in this way. But we’ll see we’ll find out over the next few weeks as the actual report comes out.michelle goldbergRight but what I think is happening or what I think could be happening is not that he’s letting himself be played and that like he doesn’t think that the truth is ever going to come out, but that what the Trump administration is doing is that by getting a head start and sort of setting the terms of the debate early, they’re muddying the waters in a way that people aren’t going to kind of be able to make sense of what comes next. Right? So if Barr weren’t a political hack long experienced in covering up Republican scandals and if he hadn’t been chosen for exactly that reason, then you can imagine a headline in which the story is Mueller didn’t establish crimes related to coordination or conspiracy. He did find significant evidence of other crimes, obstruction. And that evidence, you know kind of in keeping with the precedents of other special counsels, should now be turned over to Congress to be evaluated. Right? Instead sort of he stepped in so that the point is not to kind of convince anybody who is a close follower of this administration that Barr is capable of absolving the president. The point is just to kind of create confusing headlines and give them a talking point.david leonhardtI mean clearly if we’re trying to think about the overall feel that someone who consumed a lot of media would have gotten, yes, I think, I understand you disagree Michelle, but I think that what we know so far suggests that the outcome in the Mueller investigation is going to be less than what people would have thought. On the other hand I don’t think this is a case where when you look back at the reporting that was done by the people actually trying to report this out — people at The New York Times and the Washington Post and a lot of other places — there aren’t a lot of stories that they got wrong here. I think a lot of it was the interpretation. Ross, do you disagree with that? I mean this isn’t like W.M.D. where you can look back and say wow, that story really looks wrong.ross douthatI mean I think the reason that folks like Taibbi and other sort of left-wing critics of the media are so upset is that the locus of really bad reporting was MSNBC. And not so much reporting even as sort of coverage as like the kind of people that Rachel Maddow had on night after night to analyze this. And in that sense it’s understandable that people on the left who were skeptical of this would find it particularly upsetting because MSNBC is supposed to be obviously the left-of-center channel. But I think the worst of it was there and I think that the problems in the mainstream press were more about sort of narrative and omission. It’s not that people were specifically getting things wrong all the time, although there were a lot of cases of you know, the McClatchy report supposedly confirming that Cohen had gone to Prague, and of stories that were sort of hung out there by a single outlet and never confirmed. But in general it was more a sort of tenor issue. It was that there would be tons of reporting about low-level Trump campaign aides’s connections to Russian officials and a lot less reporting about how as time went on, most of what was in the Steele dossier looked more and more bogus, right? That would be my sort of broader press critique. That it was more that when things weren’t panning out there was less coverage than there was of, say, you know Michael Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador and so on.david leonhardtI would say let’s see the Mueller report because I think there’s a chance that although individual stories like the McClatchy story appear to have been wrong, I think there’s a good chance that much of the beat reporting on this is going to look quite solid in the end. But we have to wait and see. Okay now let’s talk about what’s going to happen next. Michelle, where do you see House Democrats going with this and where do you want them to go?michelle goldbergI’m not quite sure where I think they should go because I actually do feel like what we’re seeing so far looks like something of a cover up where Barr is trying to spin this one way and is already sort of seized the narrative and I really want Democrats to set the record straight. I’m glad that they have given him an April 2nd deadline to show them the report. So I do think that they need to agitate and do as much as possible to get the report out there and you know I feel like the line going forward should be, “If this exonerates you then why are you hiding it?” And I think it’s extremely important that the Intelligence Committee not be intimidated out of pursuing the counterintelligence implications of all of that. You know at the same time Democratic candidates have never really wanted to talk about this stuff so from just like a political perspective, it seems to make sense for them to sort of you know let the Judiciary Committee do its job, let the intelligence committee do its job. But you know kind of take the gift-wrapped present that Trump’s Justice Department gave us when it signaled that it wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act. And you know kind of start running against the very many other depredations that Trump is inflicting on this country.david leonhardtI was struck by that contrast too. I mean the idea that the Trump administration kicked out of the headlines the coverage of Barr’s summary of the Mueller report to try to take away health insurance from people I found to be a remarkable bit of political malpractice. And Ross I assume you agree that the idea of Democrats essentially trying to focus on pocketbook issues and running against Trump as a president who hasn’t improved people’s lives is a much better tactic for Democrats than scandal mongering? And in that way this might not actually have been the worst week for the Democratic Party.ross douthatI totally agree. This was a bad week if you were a Republican who was hoping that there would be a primary challenge to Donald Trump. This sort of removes one of the obvious ways that Trump could sort of fall apart politically. He’s much less likely to fall apart politically, much less likely to face a strong challenger, will be therefore somewhat stronger for re-election, but all of the other ways in which the Democrats have successfully attacked Trump and can successfully attack Trump are still there. I think the health care example which, I mean, I think most conservative policy people and legal people think this challenge is a little bit ridiculous. So it’s a case of Trump doing something that seems sort of purely partisan and doesn’t even have much intellectual heft behind it. But it’s also — the most unpopular things Trump has done have all been in the area of trying to repeal and replace Obamacare. And to the extent that this pushes us towards a health care conversation and away from a Russia conversation, elected Democrats may be very happy that it happened.david leonhardtLet’s end by talking about the 2020 candidates. Ross, you called our attention to this interesting piece written by Tyler Cowen, an economist, arguing about how the Mueller report might affect Joe Biden’s candidacy. So tell the listeners about that.ross douthatI’m not sure if I agree with this but Cowen is a smart guy and he basically argues that Biden is selling himself, presumably, as a sort of custodial candidate. A kind of return to normalcy candidate. You know, his advisers are even talking about the one-term pledge idea that older politicians often think about floating and he’s sort of an embodiment of, you know, the kind of Washington establishment that has always been most upset about Trump as a kind of norm violator and possible Putin cat’s paw. So in all of those ways you could argue that this weakens his candidacy. You know, if you just want to get Trump out because you think Putin is running our foreign policy, then getting Biden in makes more sense. But if it’s ultimately an election about domestic policy and domestic priorities then I think other Democrats maybe have more of a case to make. And the strongest argument for Biden maybe looks a little weaker.david leonhardtAnd Michelle you get the last word. How do you think the end of the Mueller investigation affects the Democrats in 2020?michelle goldbergI mean I have to say what Ross just said — like you know I’ve been really upset this week, again. Not just because the dream of Trump being led out of the White House in handcuffs has died, although you know that would be a spectacular and life-affirming thing. You know what’s upsetting to me is what I said: that you know Republicans feel so gleeful and emboldened and I think people are sort of lying down on the job of opposing them. But Ross has now presented a true silver lining of this turn of events. Right? Because if this can help end the rationale for Joe Biden’s candidacy before it even begins then I will almost say it was all worth it.david leonhardtAnd on that note we will end this segment. We’ll be right back. Two of our last three presidents have been elected despite losing the popular vote. And in Trump’s case he lost it by a lot. We are living in an era of minority rule, as Michelle has written. So last week Senator Elizabeth Warren called for an end to the electoral college.senator elizabeth warrenGet rid of the electoral college. [CHEERS].david leonhardtHer call has ignited a long simmering debate about it. Ross, you get to go first in this discussion. Tell us why you hate democracy and love the Electoral College.ross douthatWell, so, we just did a segment where I was you know full of my own self-righteousness and totally, totally convinced of all the arguments I was making and this one is going to be a little different. I’m not a strong devout believer in the Electoral College. I think it’s obviously a kind of jerry-rigged system that doesn’t do exactly what its original designers intended. And it certainly isn’t how I would design a system from scratch. At the same time the sort of scale of liberal certainty about getting rid of it inspires me to mount at least partial defenses. So I guess I’d just make a couple of points. The first is that it’s hardly abnormal to have political systems that deliver various forms of minority rule. It’s quite common in parliamentary systems to end up with minority prime ministers and minority government. So the way we get there and the U.S. is unique in our own you know American distinctive kind of way, but it’s hardly unknown in the developed world to have minority governments end up elected for one reason or the other. And — and this is my more counterintuitive point — I don’t think it’s actually the worst thing to have a system that basically tells you if you get to 50.1 percent of the vote you aren’t actually guaranteed of winning. And the way you guarantee victory is by getting to 53 or 54 or 55 percent of the vote. I think that that kind of system incentivizes parties against polarized politics. It creates an incentive against the kind of politics that we’ve had increasingly in our country and I think historically that’s how it’s worked. Now we haven’t come out of our current era of polarization which is why we keep having these outcomes and I think in the long run if we can’t get out of it then the Electoral College does become a pathway to constitutional crisis. But I think historically it’s actually worked in a more interesting way than some of its critics think.michelle goldbergI mean to me the Electoral College is intolerable just because it has given us two minority presidents within a very short period of time after many, many decades when the idea of somebody winning the presidency despite losing the popular vote was treated as this sort of like outré hypothetical that could possibly happen, but you know nobody living had ever seen it. And now it’s just a reality and it’s a reality that Trump could win re-election despite losing the popular vote by even more. And at a certain point if the majority of the country believes that their government is intolerable and can do nothing about it and can do nothing about the system that creates that outcome. I mean it’s a recipe for regime crisis and I sort of feel like if you know our country we’re a little bit younger and more vigorous there would have been a regime crisis already.ross douthatI mean I, this is, again, where I’m not making any kind of absolutist argument. I think if you get outcomes like 2016 and 2000 over and over again it does, it will ultimately lead to regime crisis. But I also think when we talk about polarization, the polarization that we’re experiencing is a distinctive somewhat unique thing in American history. The Electoral College has been around for more than 200 years. We have therefore hundreds of years of data on how it usually works. And my argument is just that historically what happens is you have brief periods of ideological or regional polarization and then you might say that the College creates incentives for parties to try and get out of them quickly because, as you say, the Democrats right now are looking at a situation where they could win the popular vote again and still lose to Trump. And that should, in my theory, create an incentive for Democrats to work harder to get towards Reaganesque or Rooseveltian majorities which is what our country actually needs to escape the cycle of polarization.david leonhardtI want to talk about one of those defenses that drives me nuts which is the idea that if you say we should get rid of the electoral college you’re saying that rural people don’t matter. Whereas all you’re saying is that all Americans should be treated equally. I’m not saying that people in Wyoming or Alaska or Vermont matter less than people in Texas or California. I’m just saying they should all matter equally. And I guess, Ross, I’m curious, as a partial defender of the Electoral College, is there some more serious version of that argument that I’m missing? I just don’t get it.ross douthatWell I think the version of the argument that I agree with is that it’s good in the system to have means by which distinctive minorities, political minorities can find political leverage without having to get to 51 or 52 percent of the vote in a national election. I don’t think a system where the 51 percent always win and the 49 percent always lose has some perfect legitimacy just because 51 percent is bigger than 49 percent. But I think that’s actually more a defense of the Senate than the Electoral College. I would defend the Senate more on those grounds. I think it’s good to create leverage points for regional, rural and so on populations that can end up neglected as I think a portion of the American population in the Midwest and Greater Appalachia has been neglected over the last 20 years. But I think the Senate does that more effectively than the Electoral College does and so that kind of leverage would survive even if you move to a popular vote. I want to ask you guys though to design your perfect system. Because the question isn’t just whether you get rid of the Electoral College, right, it’s what replaces it? How do you elect a president?david leonhardtI guess I am comfortable with a national popular vote. I understand there are risks of some sort of massive national recount that are are nightmarish. And I think it’s worth taking that seriously. So I’d be open to some sort of more proportional state based system where we get a lot closer to popular vote. But I really think that the downsides of the Electoral College absolutely swamp the downsides of a national popular vote system.ross douthatBut then it’s a national popular vote with or without a runoff?david leonhardtI mean, as we’ve talked about, I’m a big fan of this idea of ranked-choice voting. So I don’t think I would do a runoff. I’m perfectly comfortable with the idea of, you vote once. You rank your candidates and if you ranked a third party candidate first then then you go to your vote next.michelle goldbergYeah I agree. That’s I mean to be honest I haven’t given this a huge amount of thought. I mean basically I just think you should get rid of the Electoral College and have a national popular vote. But the mechanism of that vote is not something I thought about a lot. But, you know, I’m a big fan like David of ranked-choice voting in congressional elections or in state elections. Like Maine has adopted it. I think more states should adopt it. And so I can’t think of an argument against using that at the national level.ross douthatWell I mean I’m not wildly against that idea but I think every idea that you come up with creates potential downside. One thing the Electoral College definitely does is make it very hard for a third-party challenger to really challenge for the presidency unless they have a sort of concentrated regional support. Like Ross Perot, the last really successful third-party candidate, really didn’t get any electoral votes.michelle goldbergWait but Ross, you like third parties!ross douthatNo I’m not — I’m just playing around here a little bit. Right? No, I don’t think that would be so terrible but it would create a situation where someone like Howard Schultz, who neither of you guys particularly like right now, has more of an incentive to get in and help make Donald Trump president, maybe, than he would under the Electoral College system. I mean it’s the “Green Book” problem. At last I get to make an Oscar analogy, right? “Green Book” won best picture despite being, I think by general agreement, a kind of mediocre movie because nobody really hated it and people ranked it pretty high on their ranked-choice voting. But probably at least one other and maybe many other movies got more number one votes for best picture but they still lost to “Green Book.” So the ranked choice system delivers you the inoffensive president who people dislike the least, potentially, while denying the nomination to someone who maybe gets the actual most votes. And maybe that’s fine. But it is a change.michelle goldbergO.K. So that’s worth thinking through and I actually find the “Green Book” possibility very scary and persuasive. It still sounds better to me to have a system in which the sort of “meh” candidate has a chance of winning than a candidate that is virulently hated by a majority of the population.ross douthatYeah I mean I think what’s definitely true is that the Electoral College was supposed to create impediments basically to demagogues. Right?michelle goldbergRight — the electoral college was supposed to stop people like Trump. And in that respect it’s obviously failed.ross douthatYes. And the Electoral College in that sense also makes more sense in a system with stronger political parties, which we no longer have. I think that Trump himself, the fact that he could win despite the Electoral College, does show that it’s not doing one of the jobs the founders envisioned for it. At the same time, I think Hillary Clinton deserved to lose the last election because of how she campaigned. So I can’t help feeling that Trump’s election also makes a kind of case for the Electoral College in this strange way.david leonhardtTo me one of the most exciting things about getting rid of the Electoral College would be all of the places that have been wholly ignored during presidential campaigns that no longer would be. I mean our colleague Jamelle Bouie pointed out that inland California, a place with huge numbers of conservative voters almost totally ignored in presidential campaigns, would no longer be. Or big cities in Texas where there are a lot of Democratic voters. It would basically take all these people who’ve been left out of the process and and involve them again. And that’s why the idea excites me.ross douthatI mean I guess that argument to me makes more sense if we were living through an era of sort of massive political disengagement where nobody’s voting and voter turnout is falling and so on and that doesn’t seem to overall be the kind of era we’re necessarily living through, right? Like I feel like the case for a constitutional amendment to make sure that you get slightly higher turnout in rural California is not the decisive case in the way that that regime crisis case seems to me to be the much stronger case.david leonhardtI mean yes and no. Voter turnout rates among people under the age of 30 or 40 or pretty horrifically low. And so if a 25-year-old living in the inland empire of California or living in Dallas said to me, my vote doesn’t matter at all, there’s a way in which they’re right about that. And so to me the idea of making people feel like we have a more responsive political system has some inherent value to it. This could actually happen. A whole bunch of states, including California and New York, have passed laws saying they will devote their Electoral College votes to the winner of the popular vote so long as enough states do so. And in fact if you count it up we’re two thirds of the way toward having that actually happen. If a Republican were to lose when winning the popular vote and a few Republican states were to pass this legislation, I think we’re actually closer to the Electoral College not functionally mattering than a lot of people realize. So it’s a good time to dig into the upsides and downsides of it. That will do it for our Electoral College discussion. We’ll be right back with our weekly recommendation. Now it’s time for our weekly recommendation, when we give you a suggestion that is meant to take your mind off of politics. This week it’s my turn and I am going to make a recommendation that is borne out of sadness, unfortunately. An economist by the name of Alan Krueger recently committed suicide at the age of 58. He was an enormously important and influential economist. I knew Alan somewhat. I’d interviewed him many times. And one of his areas of research was happiness. What makes human beings happy. And I once asked him when I was interviewing him whether any of the research he had done had affected his own view about what to do. And he gave me two pieces of really lovely and obviously quite poignant, in retrospect, pieces of advice. And I just wanted to share them. The first is he said that the data shows that hanging out with friends really makes people happy in a way that nothing else does. In a way that work doesn’t, even in a way that hanging out with relatives doesn’t. And so he took that and said even at the end of a long day or long week when he was tired, if he was debating whether to go to a party or whether to do something with friends, even if in the moment he didn’t want to do it, the data tried to push him to do it more often. And the second piece of advice, which is something that I find myself following all the time now, is he said that people don’t really value objects that they get as gifts. They appreciate the thought but the object usually isn’t that useful to them. But they do really value experiences. And so it would make sense to kind of nudge our gifts a little bit more toward giving people experiences. You can take someone out for coffee. You can take them out to dinner. The story Alan told me is he splurged and he took his dad to a Super Bowl to watch his dad’s beloved New York Giants, and then he got a souvenir from the game framed and hung it in his office so he could look at it all the time. And I think about that a lot. And I already miss Allen and am shocked and saddened by his death as nearly the entire world of economics is. So I just wanted to share that a little bit, those two little bits of wisdom from him with the two of you and with all of our listeners.michelle goldbergYeah I mean I know a lot of people who knew him and you know, yes everybody is shocked and heartbroken. And you know even me as a non-economist kind of knew how important and significant his work was. And both of those things that you said seem like actually more valuable than like 99 percent of self-help advice that I can think of.david leonhardtAnd 99 percent of economics.michelle goldbergOh yeah, definitely.ross douthatI just took my family, my wife and three kids, we flew to Colorado to see some relatives who were moving back east and therefore won’t be in Colorado for much longer. And it was one of the worst travel experiences I’ve had because we were delayed by the bomb cyclone snowstorm that went off in Denver and then we were moved to a non-direct flight and our seats weren’t together. And when you have a three-year-old and your seats aren’t together and you’re running to catch a connection it’s a total nightmare. But the truth is that, you know, at the end of the day we’re back on the East Coast and I think the memories from the trip will either be happy ones or sort of bemused rueful entertaining ones from the disastrous travel. And in that sense it’s a sort of personal case study in David’s point, that doing things with friends or family, however challenging they may be, are essential to what makes not just life worth living but memory worth having.speakerThat’s a good place to leave our show this week.

I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.Michelle GoldbergImageI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.David LeonhardtImageI’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.More from Opinion on the Mueller report and the Electoral College:Opinion | David BrooksWe’ve All Just Made Fools of Ourselves — AgainMarch 25, 2019Opinion | Bob BauerTrump’s Shamelessness Was Outside Mueller’s JurisdictionMarch 25, 2019Opinion | Jamelle BouieGetting Rid of the Electoral College Isn’t Just About TrumpMarch 21, 2019Opinion | The Editorial BoardLet the People Pick the PresidentNov. 7, 2017How do I listen?Tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.

The special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is over, but federal prosecutors are pursuing a slew of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation.
Several investigations stemmed from the inquiry into Michael D. Cohen, Donald J. Trump’s former personal lawyer. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, turned the Cohen investigation over to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York early last year.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging two hush money payments to women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Prosecutors have examined the involvement of Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization in arranging and concealing the payments.
During a raid of Mr. Cohen’s home and office, F.B.I. agents found a recording of Mr. Trump speaking to Mr. Cohen about a payment to one of the women.
The raid also turned up evidence that partly triggered an investigation into whether foreign nationals illegally donated to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee.
Based on information brought by Mr. Cohen, in the hope that it could reduce his prison sentence, prosecutors have looked into whether the Trump Organization inflated insurance claims and whether Mr. Trump’s lawyers considered offering Mr. Cohen a pardon to keep quiet.
The Southern District of New York has also overseen two investigations that stemmed from Mr. Mueller’s cases against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman.
In one, prosecutors have weighed charges against an officer of a bank that Mr. Manafort has acknowledged defrauding.
The other investigation has examined possible violations of foreign lobbying laws by two lobbying firms and a law firm that were recruited by Mr. Manafort to assist with his work in Ukraine.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn have also raised questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee, whose chairman was Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump.
The Justice Department is investigating Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s campaign and inauguration. Federal investigators in Los Angeles have taken part in the inquiry, which has also examined issues related to the inauguration.
In another case that stemmed from Mr. Mueller’s investigation, an American lobbyist pleaded guilty to unregistered lobbying and funneling foreign money to Mr. Trump’s inaugural to buy tickets for Konstantin V. Kilimnik and a Ukrainian oligarch.
And two former business associates of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to violating federal lobbying rules.
All told, the Mueller inquiry hatched at least eight continuing federal criminal inquiries and several state and congressional investigations. There may be other investigations whose existences have not been publicly confirmed.

Barr has shown hints of frustration with how the rollout of the special counsel’s chief findings has unfolded.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos, Michael S. Schmidt and Mark MazzettiApril 3, 2019WASHINGTON — Some of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated, according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations.At stake in the dispute — the first evidence of tension between Mr. Barr and the special counsel’s office — is who shapes the public’s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history. Some members of Mr. Mueller’s team are concerned that, because Mr. Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel’s findings, Americans’ views will have hardened before the investigation’s conclusions become public.Mr. Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400-page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information. The special counsel’s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report, and some team members believe that Mr. Barr should have included more of their material in the four-page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions, according to government officials familiar with the investigation. Mr. Barr only briefly cited the special counsel’s work in his letter.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: New Insights Into the Mueller ReportThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four-page summary. Members of the special counsel’s team say something was lost.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/25:58-25:58transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: New Insights Into the Mueller ReportHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Theo Balcomb, Lisa Tobin and Paige Cowett, and edited by Larissa AndersonThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four-page summary. Members of the special counsel’s team say something was lost.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general, William Barr. The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress. Now, new reporting shows members of Mueller’s team feel that Barr’s summary did not reflect the report they wrote. It’s Thursday, April 4. So take us back to the beginning of last week. What do we know at that point?nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr, taking Bob Mueller’s 300- to 400-page report, had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the “principal conclusions” to just four pages.michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress. Mike Schmidt covers national security.michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had sent his report to the attorney general, said, I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election. But he declined to make a decision on obstruction.nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn’t reach what Barr called a “traditional prosecutorial decision.” In other words, Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn’t go as far as to conclude that he had. He essentially punted to the attorney general’s office.michael schmidtAnd in this case, by Mueller not reaching a determination, he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say, O.K., Mueller didn’t make a determination on this issue of obstruction. He did on collusion. I’m going to look at all the facts. And he makes his determination — no case to be made here on both of these issues. The problem, though, is that the perception is that Mueller, the independent investigator who’s there to do an inquiry free of politics, has not made a call on this central question. But Barr, the president’s appointee, who’s been there just for a few months, is making the decision. So the question is, is the fix in? Why is it, if Mueller didn’t come to an answer, the attorney general did?michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week, we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call. And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call. And the question is, why?michael schmidtIt’s not unusual that Barr made a call. The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not. And he was doing that. What’s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don’t look like they’re on the same page.[music]michael schmidtMueller said, I can’t make a determination on this issue. And Barr did. So why is it that they looked at it differently? Why was it that Mueller, the prosecutor here, didn’t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do, which is make a call?nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we’ve spent the last week trying to figure out. What is the difference here? What is the evidence that they’re looking at? And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice?michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned?nicholas fandosWhat we’ve now learned is that nobody’s happy. The team that was working — or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn’t properly capture what their 22-month investigation found. And Barr’s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job.michael barbaroSo let’s start with the Barr side. Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset.michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice, Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law.michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by “top cover“?michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then, when the investigation is concluded, have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry, the fruits of it, to the public and saying, look, this was done free of politics. We assessed this matter based on the facts. And now you have a result that is exposed, at least in part, to the perception that the president’s guy made the decision.michael barbaroThe attorney general.michael schmidtCorrect.nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller’s appointment in the first place.michael barbaroAnd you’re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position?michael schmidtWell, the system’s not working the way it’s supposed to. You had Mueller there for one reason — yea or nay on crimes. And on one of these central questions, he couldn’t get there. And by stepping back and saying, I don’t know, it allows at least the Democrats to say, what? How was this decision made? How did they get to this? How is it that the president’s political appointee was the ultimate decider?nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say, we need to see all the evidence. We need to see the whole file here because the president’s handpicked man made this decision. Maybe we’d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence. Bob Mueller seems to have.michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper-political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress?nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence, to him, it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge, that the president hadn’t obstructed justice. Now, you’ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power. As Democrats made famous, he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn’t be construed as obstruction of justice. They’re part of his executive powers. And so he looked at this and, I mean, he can’t make the same decision that Mueller did. Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense. And he looked at it and says, well, in our judgment and this team’s judgment, it’s not.michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks, what are you talking about it’s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice? There, in his mind, clearly wasn’t.nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence, basically, of behavior that could be construed as obstructive. He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says, when you add it all up, it doesn’t tip into —michael schmidtCriminality.nicholas fandos— criminal obstructive territory.michael barbaroRight. And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion, to make a call that Mueller wouldn’t, I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr’s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role. And so he was upset to have to make this call, but, it sounds like, felt that he had to.michael schmidtI don’t know if he’s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says, this is not the way it’s supposed to be working. Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law. I’ll step in and do that. And I think I can do that based on the facts.nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role. I’m redacting the report. I’ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out. And then you can make your own judgment. But the public has an intense interest in this. And I’ve got to say something. And I decide whether acts broke the law or not. And I don’t think this one did.michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller’s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so?nicholas fandosWe don’t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question. It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted. It may not have mattered anyway. But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four-page summary, which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction, some members of Mr. Mueller’s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22-month investigation.michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting — that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side, the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side.nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago, members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel, essentially, that his work — if it wasn’t misrepresentative of theirs — didn’t give the full picture, which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general’s letter lets on. Now, we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this. We don’t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks. He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation. But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision-making around these issues that we’ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it’s being characterized.michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment, to the degree you understand it?nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr’s concise four-page letter, they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work. And in fact, what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr. Barr handed over. So not that he shouldn’t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense, but that concurrent with that, he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture. The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them, classified information, secretive grand jury information that couldn’t become public, and ultimately didn’t use any of it.michael schmidtSo what Mueller’s folks are essentially saying is, hey, we wrote these summaries. If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation, and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president, why is it that you didn’t include some of the things that we found?michael barbaroAnd specifically, why didn’t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning? You’re making it seem like the president didn’t do anything wrong.michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr’s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful. And it completely exonerates him. If you’re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump, and you think there’s a lot of questionable behavior there, that is something that is going to irritate you mightily.michael barbaroI mean, do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here? Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship? They wanted to see their work in the public summary.nicholas fandosI don’t think that we fully know. What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team — you should use these things, or we want these things to be out. They seem to have had an intention. And they certainly now have a regret about it. But we don’t know what interaction there was in the actual decision-making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago.michael barbaroWell, so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries, especially the negative material, in his four-page summary?michael schmidtI think there’s one big, broad reason and another contemporary reason, the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and, for many years, prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone, the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated.michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime.michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution, that doesn’t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it.michael barbaroAnd Mike, by the contemporary example you referred to, I’m assuming you’re talking about James Comey.michael schmidtI’m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held. It’s right in the heat of the presidential election. He stands up and says, we, the F.B.I., have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account. We don’t think there is a case to be made here. But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets. The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made.michael barbaroAnd so you’re saying that Barr’s view would be, I’m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere.michael schmidtCorrect. We don’t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone.nicholas fandosThe problem is, this was never a normal or average criminal investigation. It has broad national security implications. And it has implications for almost every decision that’s made at the highest levels of the government.michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president’s conduct. And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they’re saying, look, this is the president of the United States. There’s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see. And O.K., Justice Department, it may not be criminal. But this is the president. And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress. It’s about a pathway of dealing with the president.nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn’t seem to disagree with that, fundamentally. He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible. But he doesn’t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department’s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law. And so he’s grappling with the Justice Department’s aversion to talk about individuals that it’s not saying broke the law. But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen. And so he’s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things.michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation, and the Justice Department determined that I didn’t break the law, then there’s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me. Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct. In this instance, there’s another issue with the president. O.K., the president didn’t break the law. But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about, Congress should know about, and need to be more closely examined. Because maybe it’s not just about breaking the law. It’s about how he conducted himself as president. And does Congress need to deal with that? And what we are starting to see from Mueller’s side is this frustration that, hey, we think there’s some bad stuff that happened here. But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn’t break the law, he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president’s conduct. It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report, the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn’t break the law, and the president turning around and saying, I was fully exonerated. And they’re saying, hey, America, we think more of this process needs to play out.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of, how do we investigate a sitting president? And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that? And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have. In Nixon, that pendulum swung too far in the president’s direction. In the Starr investigation of Clinton, it went the other way. The investigator had too much power. And here, between Mueller and Barr’s teams, they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with. And it’s the same issue that we’ve been looking at for 50 years, just the latest episode of it.michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation, these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate.nicholas fandosCorrect.michael schmidtIt’s how much you can tell the public, and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with? And there’s no clear pathway on that. So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president. Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president’s enemies as trying to get him. And the confidence in that process then erodes. And it’s messy. And it’s hard to figure out. What are the real facts here? What really happened?michael barbaroBut at this point, we’re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress. We’re still waiting on the full report. So won’t this tension that you’re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we’ll ultimately have access to?nicholas fandosIt may be. And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day. But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time. It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report. And for that time, Bill Barr’s conclusion that the president didn’t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative. And I think that what we’re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out, the narrative is baked — so much so that even if it shows, for instance, that the president didn’t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office, that there’s not room to have a full debate around that, that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point, and that it won’t quite matter what the report says for the president’s political fate.michael barbaroNick, Mike, thank you very much.nicholas fandosThank you guys.michael schmidtThanks for having us.archived recording (jerry nadler)The committee has a job to do. The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct.michael barbaroOn Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report.archived recording (jerry nadler)That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves — not the attorney general’s summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence.michael barbaroThe committee’s chairman, Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York, said he would not immediately issue a subpoena.

A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics. In one case, a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich. All together, the two men killed 11 people. The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism.

See you tomorrow.However, the special counsel’s office never asked Mr. Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report, a person familiar with the investigation said. And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information, like classified material, secret grand-jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential, according to two government officials.The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation, according to two government officials familiar with Mr. Barr’s thinking. They pointed to the decision by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices.The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel’s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr. Barr explained, although the report is believed to examine Mr. Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation. It was unclear how much discussion Mr. Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public. It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team, which included 19 lawyers, about 40 F.B.I. agents and other personnel.At the same time, Mr. Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr. Mueller and his team. Mr. Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel’s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry, according to the two government officials. After Mr. Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter, Mr. Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr. Trump of wrongdoing.Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr. Mueller’s office and the Justice Department. They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr. Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr. Barr’s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress. Under the regulations, Mr. Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate.Read Attorney General William Barr’s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter, by Attorney General William P. Barr, details the main findings of the special counsel’s two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.A debate over how the special counsel’s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks, with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr. Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president’s favor.In his letter to Congress outlining the report’s chief conclusions, Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia’s 2016 election interference. While Mr. Mueller made no decision on his other main question, whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry, he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr. Trump.Mr. Mueller’s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment “leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime,” Mr. Barr wrote. He and his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr. Trump had committed an obstruction offense.Mr. Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little. But according to officials familiar with the attorney general’s thinking, he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory. Mr. Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr. Trump while clearing him, they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr. Comey endured in the Clinton investigation.VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr. Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations. The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people’s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court.Mr. Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey.Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel’s investigators viewed as troubling for the president, Mr. Barr has suggested that Mr. Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice. “The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question,” Mr. Barr wrote in his March 24 letter.Mr. Mueller examined Mr. Trump’s attempts to maintain control over the investigation, including his firing of Mr. Comey and his attempt to oust Mr. Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.The fallout from Mr. Barr’s letter outlining the Russia investigation’s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible, a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January. He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid-April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out. He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report.Mr. Barr, who took office in February, has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation’s findings has unfolded. In his follow-up letter to lawmakers on Friday, he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter.Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller have been friends for 30 years, and Mr. Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr. Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation. He said he told Mr. Trump that Mr. Mueller was a “straight shooter who should be dealt with as such.” Mr. Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division when Mr. Barr was attorney general under George Bush, and their families are friends.Mr. Barr’s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House. The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr. Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress. The chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, has not said when he will use the subpoena, but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr. Barr’s characterization of what Mr. Mueller’s team found.“The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct,” Mr. Nadler said. “That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves — not the attorney general’s summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence.”Republicans, who have embraced Mr. Barr’s letter clearing Mr. Trump, have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on.Mr. Trump has fully embraced Mr. Barr’s version of events. For days, he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a “complete and total exoneration” and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry.Katie Benner and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

Barr said that law enforcement officials were working to make the special counsel’s report public in the coming weeks.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Katie BennerMarch 29, 2019WASHINGTON — The special counsel’s report on the investigation into Russia’s election interference will be made public by mid-April, Attorney General William P. Barr told lawmakers on Friday, adding that the White House would not see the document before he sent it to Congress.“Everyone will soon be able to read it,” Mr. Barr wrote in a letter to the chairmen of the congressional judiciary committees.Prosecutors from the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and other law enforcement officials are scouring the report for sensitive information to black out before releasing it, including secret grand jury testimony, classified materials and information about other continuing federal investigations, Mr. Barr wrote.He said the report — which covers Moscow’s campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race, whether any Trump associates conspired and whether the president obstructed the inquiry — was nearly 400 pages, plus supplements. He said he planned to testify on Capitol Hill in early May, shortly after the report’s release, to discuss it with lawmakers.[Read Mr. Barr’s letter.]Mr. Barr, who was sworn in as attorney general last month, has committed since his confirmation hearing to making public as much of the highly anticipated report as possible. But his declaration on Sunday, two days after the report was delivered to him, that Mr. Trump had not illegally obstructed justice drew swift condemnation from Democrats. They accused him of stepping in where Mr. Mueller had declined to make a prosecutorial decision.Mr. Barr said that Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, concurred with his finding on the obstruction question but noted that Mr. Mueller, while he declined to make a judgment on the issue, also stopped short of explicitly exonerating the president.The House passed a resolution this month, 420 to 0, demanding that the full report be released. Democrats have called for the Justice Department to send them the underlying investigative files as well.“Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence,” Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement in response to Mr. Barr’s letter.Mr. Trump has already seized on Mr. Barr’s findings as vindication, declaring during a rally with supporters on Thursday night in Grand Rapids, Mich., that the cloud hanging over his presidency had finally cleared.“After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump said. “The collusion delusion is over.”Mr. Trump said during a news conference on Friday in Florida that he had nothing to hide and that he had “great confidence” in Mr. Barr. “This was a hoax,” Mr. Trump said of the investigation.Mr. Barr has weighed whether to assert the administration’s power to keep portions of the report secret from Congress, under the executive privilege that can protect internal information like the president’s private conversations. Some of those discussions were at the heart of the question of whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry, complicating the issue.Mr. Barr reiterated that Mr. Trump had publicly stated that he would defer to the Justice Department, “although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report,” the attorney general wrote.“Accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review,” Mr. Barr added.However, it remains an open question whether Justice Department lawyers themselves will excise material they believe could be privileged before sending the report to Congress.It is also not clear whether Mr. Barr or other politically appointed officials would be a part of such a redaction process. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on how the department would handle executive privilege issues.House Democrats have already begun portraying the results of the Mueller investigation as a starting point for their scrutiny of Mr. Trump. They have opened investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign and his business dealings before and after he took office, and other law enforcement investigations loom, including inquiries into Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee and his role in hush-money payments during the election to women who claimed extramarital affairs with him. Mr. Trump has denied the affairs, though he has insisted that the payments were private transactions that violated no laws.

Nadler has not yet said if he'll send the subpoenas, which would be the first step in a potentially long fight with the Justice Department over the materials.The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, stepping up a separate, wide-ranging investigation into Trump and his personal and political dealings.On the Mueller report, House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide an unredacted verson to Congress, along with underlying materials. The Justice Department ignored that deadline, with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that he was in the process of redacting portions of the almost 400-page report and it would be released by mid-April, "if not sooner."The vote further escalates the Democrats' battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see, a fight that could eventually head to court if the two sides can't settle their differences through negotiation. Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr.In the letter last week, Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material, in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that "would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties."Democrats say they want access to all of that information, even if some of it can't be disclosed to the public. Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions, but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas "in very short order." He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information."This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job, not the attorney general's, to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office," Nadler said.The five former Trump advisers who could receive subpoenas are strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson. Donaldson served as McGahn's chief of staff before both left the administration.The five were key witnesses in Mueller's probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month, along with dozens of other people connected to Trump. Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller's investigation "were sent outside the White House," meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege.The top Republican on the Judiciary panel, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3,000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate.Collins said the authorization for all of the subpoenas is "reckless" and that Democrats shouldn't be asking for documents that the Justice Department can't legally disclose to the public. The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information."We have a pre-emptive chairman who has gone out with pre-emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised him," Collins said. "This is nothing but political theater."Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report's release while also saying he wouldn't mind if the full version was made public. Still, he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information. He tweeted Tuesday that "there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy" Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who has also called for the full release.Mueller notified Barr that he had completed the investigation March 22 and sent him the report. In a four-page summary of that report released two days later, Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump's campaign "conspired or coordinated" with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out "evidence on both sides" of the question.Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter, declaring that Mueller's evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe.

Mueller III’s investigation, saying, “Why should I?”CreditCreditEmile Ducke for The New York TimesBy Andrew E. KramerApril 3, 2019MOSCOW — The email came out of the blue, from an aide to the mysterious Russian billionaire, Oleg V. Deripaska, who is said to be close to President Vladimir V. Putin and an on-again, off-again character in the two-year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Would I be interested in interviewing Mr. Deripaska, the aide asked. It was a bit like being summoned to meet with Greta Garbo or J.D. Salinger.Of course, I said, aware that Mr. Deripaska normally communicated, if at all, through the phalanx of lawyers and publicity agents he surrounded himself with. I wondered to myself why he had suddenly decided to speak out.Soon enough, I found myself sitting alone in a hotel conference room, at a table bearing a gigantic fruit platter, unsure what to expect. This was, after all, a man who had emerged on top in Russia’s bloody aluminum wars in the 1990s, and was accused in United States Treasury Department documents of suspected ties to organized crime, money laundering and ordering a contract killing.He is a man of about average stature, whose most striking feature is his large, round head. He was intense, and spoke in a robotic English, so as not to worry about mistranslations, he said.It soon became clear that he saw the determination of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that the Trump administration had not colluded with Russia, at least according to a Justice Department summary of his findings, as an opening to rehabilitate his image in the West.This despite the fact that Mr. Deripaska had refused to cooperate with the investigation, revealing for the first time that he had received written questions from the Mueller team but had declined to answer them.“Do I feel like your president, that I am exonerated?” he said at one point. “I never felt guilty. It was annoying for me. There was this huge crush on my business, on my companies, when sanctions were put on the companies I founded.”ImageLike President Trump, Mr. Deripaska took a victory lap after the special counsel’s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesOver cups of special black tea from his home region, Krasnodar, he complained of the tendency of the American news media to rush to judgment and professed confidence in the United States justice system, which he said would ultimately prove his innocence of any wrongdoing.A graduate of a prestigious physics faculty, Mr. Deripaska rose to wealth in the 1990s, strong arming his way to a virtual monopoly over the Russian aluminum industry. When it placed sanctions on him and his companies last year, the Treasury Department cited his links to the Russian government, saying he profits from the country’s “malign activity around the globe.”Even while keeping a low profile, he pursued a costly lobbying and legal effort to assert his innocence. Initially, this revolved around sanctions on his businesses, and with the help of a global influence-buying operation he did persuade the Treasury Department to lift sanctions on his aluminum empire in January.Mr. Deripaska now wants to escape the personal sanctions, which hinder his ability to do business in the United States. Last month, he filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of those sanctions, which he claims have cost him $7.5 billion.The conclusion that members of the Trump campaign had not colluded with Russians, Mr. Deripaska said, suggested the tide was shifting in campaigns of innuendo and guilt through leaks to the news media. If so, he said, the American justice system might also eventually clear him of other accusations never proven in court, such as ordering a contract murder.“I always believe in justice,” said Mr. Deripaska, whose lawyers have frequently fought to keep suits from being brought in American courts, saying they have no jurisdiction. “For us outside the United States, Mueller signals that the U.S. legal system is still alive, it still exists.”Mr. Deripaska had faced scrutiny for financial entanglements with a former Trump campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who in July 2016 reportedly asked an associate to offer Mr. Deripaska a private briefing on the presidential race, in hopes of settling a $26 million lawsuit stemming from a failed investment venture. The two had been business associates a decade ago. Mr. Deripaska had denied receiving the offer, but had not addressed these matters in detail while the investigation continued.“There was a new reality in the U.S. In politics, in social life, you do not respect presumption of innocence,” he said, speaking of the sanctions imposed on him last year and leaks to the news media about the Russia investigation. “There is no due process. Without any court, the public can consider people guilty of something.”Mr. Deripaska was an early focus of the F.B.I. investigation into Russian meddling. In September 2016, two months before the election, F.B.I. agents questioned him in an early morning visit to his New York residence.He declined to elaborate on the specific, written questions the special counsel later sent to Moscow, but said they generally tracked news media reports about prosecutors’ suspicions. He did not answer on the advice of his lawyers, he said. Besides, he said, “Why should I?”ImageOnce business associates, Paul J. Manafort and Mr. Deripaska had fallen out by the time Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign in 2016.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr. Manafort agreed to work for the Trump campaign for free, but did seek compensation elsewhere. In an email reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Manafort suggested to a former employee, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, that his dispute with the Russian tycoon might be resolved by offering “private briefings” about the campaign. Mr. Manafort also transferred internal Trump campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik, who the special counsel said had ties to Russian intelligence.These circumstances still have congressional investigators alarmed. “You might think it’s O.K. that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness,” Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said at a hearing last week. “I don’t.”In the interview, Mr. Deripaska denied, as he had when The Washington Post first reported the offer of private briefings in 2017, ever having received from Mr. Manafort either an offer or any information about the campaign.“For me, it’s just absurd,” he said. “I had no interest in the U.S. election. Why on earth, if I have no interest, would somebody offer private briefings to me?” He last met Mr. Manafort in 2011, he said.“It’s not even sociable,” he said of the reported offer of briefings. “It looks like this: You haven’t seen this guy, you know you have this huge sum of a dispute, and then you are like, ‘Let’s go and drink a cup of coffee.’”Mr. Deripaska said that he indeed suspended his multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Mr. Manafort, but not because Mr. Manafort had asked him to do so or because he had received anything from the campaign chairman in return.“My lawyers felt that might put me at risk, which anyway happened later, when Manafort appeared in the campaign,” he said, referring to the eventual sanctions that came in 2018. “They didn’t want to bring more attention,” to the business dispute with a man who had become prominent in American politics, he said. He later refiled the lawsuit.In fighting to lift the personal sanctions, Mr. Deripaska must overcome years-old accusations of ties to organized crime related to his path from the ashes of the former Soviet Union’s aluminum industry to a billionaire with global reach, and allegations he is a front for the Kremlin on foreign policy matters.Mr. Deripaska called these accusations “balderdash” and his lawsuit challenged the sanction on constitutional grounds. He also denied he is close to Mr. Putin, insisting he only deals with the government on matters of business regulation.The conclusion of the special counsel’s investigation, he said, gave him hope for success. “I reaffirm to myself that the U.S. systems, that U.S. institutions, still exist.”Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington Related CoverageTwo Capitals, One Russian Oligarch: How Oleg Deripaska Is Trying to Escape U.S. SanctionsNov. 4, 2018ImageTrump Administration Imposes New Sanctions on Putin CroniesApril 6, 2018ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsOn ‘S.N.L.,’ Trump, Mueller and Barr Interpret the Final Report Very Differently - The New York Times

All the people I was told were bad guys all got away with it. Donald Trump, Jussie Smollett and worst of all, Duke. The big story, of course, was that white O.J. was not indicted for collusion.

It’s like if Scrooge woke up on Christmas morning, discovered he had a second chance at life, then found Tiny Tim and took a crowbar to his good leg.CHE:Man, I can’t believe I actually thought for a second that the F.B.I. was going to lock up the sitting President of the United States, simply because he’s guilty. I think it’s ’cause I’m around white people all the time. And white people have this thing I call toxic optimism. It’s the kind of optimism that makes you believe you can get into college because your mother’s Aunt Becky. I’m sure Aunt Viv’s kids don’t have that much optimism.

That’s where the real action is.”Interpreting for Yang, Oh replied to him, “Glorious Leader says you sound like Rachel Maddow right now.”Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the fallout from Barr’s letter.JOST:Well, this week made me feel insane. All the people I was told were bad guys all got away with it. Donald Trump, Jussie Smollett and worst of all, Duke. The big story, of course, was that white O.J. was not indicted for collusion. And that Robert Mueller did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice. Or, as it was reported on Fox News, [plays a montage of smiling Fox News personalities, set to Kool & the Gang’s “Celebration”]. I haven’t seen Fox News anchors smile like that since I.C.E. agents pulled into a Home Depot parking lot. So, Trump found out that he’s not getting indicted in the Russia investigation, and I’m sure that he was grateful that it’s all over, and he’s completely ready to move on. [Plays video of Trump saying, “All of the Democrat politicians, they have to be held accountable.”] Wow. It’s like if Scrooge woke up on Christmas morning, discovered he had a second chance at life, then found Tiny Tim and took a crowbar to his good leg.CHE:Man, I can’t believe I actually thought for a second that the F.B.I. was going to lock up the sitting President of the United States, simply because he’s guilty. I think it’s ’cause I’m around white people all the time. And white people have this thing I call toxic optimism. It’s the kind of optimism that makes you believe you can get into college because your mother’s Aunt Becky. I’m sure Aunt Viv’s kids don’t have that much optimism. Black people just aren’t that optimistic. I said the phrase “checks and balances” to a black lady and she rolled her eyes at me for so long, I thought she fell asleep.Weekend Update Deskside Segment of the WeekCecily Strong returned to the “Weekend Update” desk as the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, celebrating her return to television after she was rebuked by her own network and temporarily taken off the air after she questioned the loyalty of a Muslim lawmaker.As Strong said, “This Mueller report completely exonerated the president and therefore everybody on the Trump Train. So somebody at Fox News said my name into a bathroom mirror three times and here I am.”She went on to thank her “superfans,” describing them as “mean, horny men laying in hospital beds and white prison gangs who control the remote on Saturday.” When Jost told her she didn’t have to shout, Strong replied, “Mama’s got one volume and it’s three Chardonnays deep at a crowded party.”Fake Commercial of the WeekIt seemed inevitable that this week’s “S.N.L.” would have a sendup of “Us,” the hit horror movie written and directed by Jordan Peele. But it did so in a surprisingly clever fashion: This filmed commercial seemed to be a parody of a Discover credit card campaign, with a woman (Ego Nwodim) informing her spouse (Kenan Thompson) that some weird charges have recently turned up on their bill and she’s calling the company. “With Discover Card, you get to talk to a real person who’s just like you,” she says cheerfully.But the operator she reaches is her doppelgänger (also played by Nwodim) — an estimable recreation of the evil duplicate played by Lupita Nyong’o in “Us.” Nwodim tells the operator that someone used her credit card to buy a bunch of red jumpsuits, motorcycle gloves, hundreds of rabbits and giant scissors. In a halting voice, the evil doppelgänger replies, “When you go on vacation … I sit in … a cave.”Jussie Smollett Sketch of the WeekOnly a few days after prosecutors made the controversial decision to drop all charges against Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” co-star who had been accused of staging a hate crime, “S.N.L.” presented a sketch about the actor that nonetheless made no mention of these recent developments.In the sketch, Chris Redd plays Smollett, arriving late to a meeting with his manager (Sandra Oh), the “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels (Kenan Thompson) and other executives (Kate McKinnon, Ego Nwodim and Mikey Day) who are trying to have him fired from the show. But Redd insists he has recently been the victim of another mysterious crime. Reaching into a bag, he says, “Look, guys! The killer — he left me a bunch of clues!”McKinnon asks, “What killer?”Day adds, “You’re still alive, Jussie.”You decide if the sketch was too soon or too little, too late.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsDemocratic-Led House Panel Authorizes Subpoenas for Mueller Report, Evidence - The New York Times

The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report, without redactions, as well as underlying evidence.Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort, important judicial precedents and Barr's rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential.CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH?Yes. Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary.If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material, the House could vote to hold him "in contempt" and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena. Legal experts said that process could take years. Barr's "principal conclusions" letter said Mueller's inquiry did not establish that Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction.The letter provided scant details of the findings, though Trump immediately claimed "complete and total exoneration." The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency. House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020.A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. In 2012, the House, then controlled by Republicans, subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales, dubbed "Fast and Furious." Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to comply. The House voted to hold him in contempt, marking the first time in U.S. history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president's Cabinet.The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office, with a settlement reached in 2018.WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT?Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making "redactions that are required" before releasing the Mueller report. He cited four reasons for redactions: protecting secret grand jury proceedings; safeguarding intelligence-gathering sources and methods; shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations; and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations.Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors. U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it.Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government.WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY?Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight.Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves "grave hostile acts of a foreign power" or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake.A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings.H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken "elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials." The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment. If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president's interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary's need for evidence.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|Explainer: Can Democratic Subpoenas Force the Release of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?AdvertisementSupported byExplainer: Can Democratic Subpoenas Force the Release of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?By ReutersApril 2, 2019WASHINGTON — Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and President Donald Trump's actions related to the inquiry.The question is: how successful will they be?Attorney General William Barr, who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller's report to release, sent lawmakers a four-page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller's "principal conclusions" and has promised to release the nearly 400-page report by the middle of this month, with some parts blacked out, or "redacted."That has not satisfied Democrats, who control the House. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report, without redactions, as well as underlying evidence.Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort, important judicial precedents and Barr's rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential.CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH?Yes. Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary.If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material, the House could vote to hold him "in contempt" and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena. Legal experts said that process could take years. Barr's "principal conclusions" letter said Mueller's inquiry did not establish that Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction.The letter provided scant details of the findings, though Trump immediately claimed "complete and total exoneration." The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency. House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020.A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. In 2012, the House, then controlled by Republicans, subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales, dubbed "Fast and Furious." Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to comply. The House voted to hold him in contempt, marking the first time in U.S. history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president's Cabinet.The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office, with a settlement reached in 2018.WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT?Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making "redactions that are required" before releasing the Mueller report. He cited four reasons for redactions: protecting secret grand jury proceedings; safeguarding intelligence-gathering sources and methods; shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations; and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations.Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors. U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it.Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government.WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY?Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight.Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves "grave hostile acts of a foreign power" or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake.A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings.H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken "elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials." The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment. If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president's interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary's need for evidence.

ImagePresident Trump delivers remarks during a rally in in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Thursday.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesBy Linda QiuMarch 29, 2019What Mr. Trump Said“By the way, we’re bringing a lot of those car companies back.” This is exaggerated.Mr. Trump’s claims of a “decimated” automobile industry before he took office and its revitalization since are not rooted in fact. Employment in the auto industry declined during the Great Recession, but has been steadily increasing since mid-2009. Similarly, domestic auto production increased during the economic recovery before declining in mid-2016, while domestic new car sales grew for seven straight years until 2017. His examples of the auto companies “pouring” into Michigan and other Midwestern states were a $4.5 billion investment in Detroit by Fiat Chrysler, a $1 billion investment by Ford in Chicago, and a $300 million investment in Michigan by General Motors. Chrysler’s plans would reopen a car plant, while Ford and G.M. are increasing production capacity at existing plants. In contrast, G.M. said it would idle five car factories in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Canada while Chrysler is cutting jobs at an Illinois plant. According to the Reshoring Initiative, a group that encourages companies to move back to the United States, announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016. What Mr. Trump Said“The special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. … Total exoneration, complete vindication.”This is false.While the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III did not conclude that Mr. Trump or his campaign coordinated with Russia, according to a summary of Mr. Mueller’s report by Attorney General William P. Barr, the special counsel stopped short of absolving Mr. Trump on obstruction.Mr. Barr quoted the special counsel as stating that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” and wrote that Mr. Mueller did not draw conclusions about whether Mr. Trump’s conduct amounted to obstruction of justice.What Mr. Trump Said“I’m going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.”False.The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, was first implemented by the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million every year under Mr. Obama.Mr. Trump requested no funding at all for the initiative in his 2018 budget request, effectively eliminating the program, though Congress ended up appropriating nearly $300 million. His latest budget proposes a 90 percent cut to the program, reducing funding to $30 million.What Mr. Trump Said“The deductibles on Obamacare are so high, on average $7,000.”This is exaggerated.An analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that average deductibles for plans offered on the federal marketplace in 2019 greatly varied based on the type and tier of plan and the income of the enrollee.Of plans that included both prescription drugs and medical spending in the deductible, those in the bronze tier (which have lower premiums but higher out of pocket costs) had the highest average deductible, at $6,259, while platinum plans had the lowest, at $48.For silver-tiered plans, the most common choice, the average deductible was $4,375. For consumers whose incomes fell below 250 percent of the federal poverty line, deductibles ranged from $239 to $3,169 after cost-sharing reductions.What Mr. Trump Said“We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.”This is misleading.Currently, Mr. Trump’s administration is seeking to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in court, including provisions that protect people with pre-existing conditions. In 2017, Mr. Trump also backed several bills to repeal the health care law, some of which would have also undermined protections for pre-existing conditions.In his budget, Mr. Trump renewed his call to repeal the law and instead called for the enactment of legislation similar to a 2017 bill sponsored by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. That bill prohibits insurers from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions, but it does permit states to obtain waivers that allow insurers to charge more based on health status.OTHER CLAIMSMr. Trump also repeated more than a dozen claims The Times has previously fact-checked:He misstated the results of the Electoral College in the 2016 election as 306 votes to 223 votes. (He won 306 to Hillary Clinton’s 232, though after defections by electors, the count was 304 to 227.)He falsely claimed that wages were rising for the first time “after years of stagnation.” (Wages began rising under Mr. Obama.)He claimed “we did really well with women” in the 2016 election. (Exit polls indicate that just 42 percent of women voted for him, which was less than for Mrs. Clinton and the two Republican nominees who preceded him.)He claimed that the United States had become the largest oil and gas producer in the world “very recently.” (This has been the case since 2013.)He falsely said his tax cuts are “the biggest in the history of our country.” (Several others are larger.)He exaggerated when he claimed to have eliminated the estate tax. (The 2017 tax law increased the threshold, but did not eliminate it.)He misleadingly claimed to have passed Veterans’ Choice after 40 years of failed efforts. (He signed reforms to the health care program, but it has existed since 2014.) He falsely claimed “you couldn’t fire anybody” from the Department of Veterans Affairs before he signed V.A. Accountability into law. (He signed a law that would make it easier to remove bad employees, but the department had been able to fire people before.)He said the Green New Deal calls for “no more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family.” (A now-deleted summary of the plan did refer to eliminating cows and air travel, but the legislation itself does not.)He falsely claimed that other countries “are giving us their worst people “ through the diversity visa program. (Applicants enter of their own volition, and must pass background checks that bar criminals and the indigent.)He exaggerated the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico as $100 billion per year over the last several years. (It was $78 billion in 2018, up from $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016.)He claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement made “266,000 arrests of criminal aliens” including those who had committed murders, sexual assaults and kidnapping. (The most common offenses were immigration, traffic and drug violations.)He misleading accused Democrats of allowing for the execution of newborn infants. (Infants are rarely born alive after abortion procedures, and if they are, doctors do not kill them.)Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

Britain’s departure from the European Union had been scheduled for Friday.CreditCreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersBy Benjamin MuellerMarch 28, 2019LONDON — Britain’s tottering efforts to leave the European Union remained at an impasse on Thursday as allies of Prime Minister Theresa May tried to keep her deal alive in the face of unbending opposition.The deal, already defeated twice in Parliament, was given new life on Wednesday after Mrs. May promised Conservative Party colleagues who are hard-line supporters of leaving the bloc that she would step down if it were passed, and let someone else take over the next stage of talks with Brussels for the process known as Brexit.[Who could be Britain’s next prime minister? Here are some contenders.]But even her offer to resign was not enough to assuage hard-line Conservatives or her putative allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, or D.U.P., who hate the deal.So the government tried a new tack on Thursday: Ministers said they would disassemble Mrs. May’s deal into its two parts — one called the withdrawal agreement, and the other the political declaration — and ask Parliament to vote Friday only on the first.The withdrawal agreement outlines the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union, while the political declaration deals with the tangled question of its future relationship with the bloc.What Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has said he would allow Parliament to vote again only if the plan had changed substantially since it had been rejected resoundingly — twice — and on Thursday he said the government had met that test.Ministers were pitching the vote to pro-Brexit hard-liners as their last opportunity to secure Britain’s exit from the European Union in the coming months, lest pro-Europeans in Parliament take control and try to frustrate Brexit or force a longer delay.Ministers also hoped the date of the vote — March 29, the originally scheduled day for Britain’s exit — would put some symbolic pressure on pro-Brexit Conservatives to swallow their objections and back Mrs. May.But the withdrawal agreement contains some of the most contentious pieces of Mrs. May’s plan.Among them is the so-called backstop that at least temporarily binds Britain and, to a greater extent, Northern Ireland to European trading rules so as to avoid customs checks on the historically contentious border between Ireland, part of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.Unionists in Northern Ireland reject the backstop because they believe it would create regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, putting the union at risk.And British news media reports late Thursday said unionists intended to vote against Mrs. May’s plan again on Friday, considerably narrowing the prime minister’s path to victory.ImagePrime Minister Theresa May addressing Parliament on Wednesday. She has offered to resign if lawmakers approve her Brexit agreement.CreditJessica Taylor/UK Parliament, via ReutersThere was some hope among Conservatives that splitting Mrs. May’s plan in two would strengthen her case with opposition Labour lawmakers, whose main objections are to the political declaration and not the withdrawal agreement.But Labour leaders reacted angrily to the idea on Thursday, noting that Mrs. May had previously said the two pieces of her plan were inextricably linked.Keir Starmer, a senior Labour official, warned on Thursday that splitting them “would leave us with the blindest of blindfold Brexits.” He was referring to Labour’s fear that, if Parliament passed part of Mrs. May’s plan and the prime minister resigned, a hard-line pro-Brexit politician like Boris Johnson would take over and shape the crucial next stage of negotiations.Stephen Doughty, a Labour member of Parliament, said, “This looks to me like trickery of the highest order.”Confusion swirled all day in Parliament about the government’s plans, with ministers leaving lawmakers in the dark about what they would be voting on Friday until late in the afternoon.At the same time, anti-Brexit lawmakers were working behind the scenes to pick a few alternate plans to put before Parliament on Monday, in case Mrs. May’s deal did not pass before then.ImageBrexit supporters in Lillingstone Lovell, England, on Wednesday.CreditMatt Dunham/Associated PressThe anti-Brexit lawmakers were buoyed by votes in Parliament on Wednesday night on a catalog of proposals that clashed with Mrs. May’s.Those included once-radical ideas like holding a second public vote on Brexit or revoking Britain’s decision to leave altogether, as well as Brexit plans that would see Britain keep closer ties to Europe than Mrs. May’s proposal envisioned.The votes represented the first time in two years of Brexit negotiations that Parliament was allowed to express its feelings about alternate plans, and some lawmakers hoped they would show a path to compromise.But to the chagrin of Mrs. May’s opponents, all eight alternate plans failed to muster a majority, leading the British newspaper The Guardian to run this headline on its front page on Thursday: “No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.”Some proposals got close. A plan for a customs union between Britain and the European Union lost by six votes. (Mr. Bercow said a tallying error had originally led him to say it was an eight-vote margin.)And the option of holding another referendum to test Britons’ views about leaving the bloc attracted more support than expected: 268 members voted in favor, and 295 against.ImageBoris Johnson, center, is among the pro-Brexit politicians who have pledged to support Mrs. May’s deal in recent days.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersThe result on the proposal for a second referendum, coming after a weekend when hundreds of thousands of people marched in London for another vote and more than five million signed a petition asking to cancel Brexit, was a sign of how the views of anti-Brexit politicians have grown more intense as the process drags on.The nonbinding votes set the stage for another round of debate in Parliament on Monday, when the menu of alternate options is to be whittled and politicians given a second chance to coalesce behind a new plan.If Mrs. May’s withdrawal agreement passes on Friday, Parliament would meet the European Union’s deadline for completing the Brexit process and extracting Britain from the bloc by May 22.If not, Britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal on April 12 in what analysts say would be a calamitous exit, or it could ask for a longer extension.Mrs. May’s offer to resign was another reminder that, for all the anxiety in Britain over Brexit, Conservative Party politics are still dictated to a large degree by members’ leadership ambitions.Pro-Brexit politicians like Mr. Johnson have long been angling to take over from Mrs. May, and the chance to do so sooner rather than later seemed to be enough for many to back down from months of fierce opposition to her deal.Mr. Johnson once said that Mrs. May’s deal had strapped a “suicide vest” around the country. Another hard-line pro-Brexit lawmaker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the prime minister’s plan would turn Britain into “a slave state.”On Wednesday, both said they would back her deal.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Like Solomon and Baby, The Government Divides Its Exit Proposal in Two.

Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel’s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee’s chairman.It went downhill from there.The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject. The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barr’s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election.“With McCarthyism,” a senator was “chasing after Russian Communists,” Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said. “Now we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.”Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow — especially without seeing Mr. Mueller’s report first. The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr.Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.“You might think that it’s O.K. that the president’s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I don’t think that’s O.K. You might think it’s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,” Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker.He continued: “You might think that it’s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions. And you might think it’s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that’s all O.K. You might say that’s just what you need to do to win. But I don’t think it’s O.K. I think it’s immoral. I think it’s unethical. I think it’s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it’s corrupt.”ImageRepresentative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, left, confers with Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s former chairman.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesDemocrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller’s findings, but as Mr. Schiff’s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller’s absolution of Mr. Trump. They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog.“The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,” Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, “Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.”Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of “knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.” He “should be forced to resign from Congress!” the president wrote on Twitter.Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The committee’s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Mueller’s findings are fully understood.Democrats backed him. “History will clarify what has happened,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as “calm, professional, patriotic,” and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been “in stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,” Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.VideoRepublicans in the House Intelligence Committee called for the chairman, Representative Adam Schiff, to resign on Thursday. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, supported the move. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans “did the wrong thing.”CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York Times“What is the president afraid of — that he would go after a chairman of the committee?” she said. “I think they’re just scaredy-cats. They just don’t know what to do.”The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucus’s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority.Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.“In the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,” Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year. Mr. Nunes’s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congress’s more bipartisan bodies.“We should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,” Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.Thursday’s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on “Putin’s Playbook: The Kremlin’s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.” Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States.“The bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,” said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama. “In my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.”The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation.

Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel’s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee’s chairman.It went downhill from there.The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject. The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barr’s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election.“With McCarthyism,” a senator was “chasing after Russian Communists,” Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said. “Now we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.”Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow — especially without seeing Mr. Mueller’s report first. The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr.Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.“You might think that it’s O.K. that the president’s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I don’t think that’s O.K. You might think it’s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,” Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker.He continued: “You might think that it’s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions. And you might think it’s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that’s all O.K. You might say that’s just what you need to do to win. But I don’t think it’s O.K. I think it’s immoral. I think it’s unethical. I think it’s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it’s corrupt.”ImageRepresentative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, left, confers with Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s former chairman.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesDemocrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller’s findings, but as Mr. Schiff’s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller’s absolution of Mr. Trump. They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog.“The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,” Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, “Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.”Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of “knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.” He “should be forced to resign from Congress!” the president wrote on Twitter.Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The committee’s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Mueller’s findings are fully understood.Democrats backed him. “History will clarify what has happened,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as “calm, professional, patriotic,” and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been “in stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,” Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.VideoRepublicans in the House Intelligence Committee called for the chairman, Representative Adam Schiff, to resign on Thursday. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, supported the move. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans “did the wrong thing.”CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York Times“What is the president afraid of — that he would go after a chairman of the committee?” she said. “I think they’re just scaredy-cats. They just don’t know what to do.”The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucus’s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority.Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.“In the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,” Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year. Mr. Nunes’s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congress’s more bipartisan bodies.“We should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,” Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.Thursday’s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on “Putin’s Playbook: The Kremlin’s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.” Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States.“The bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,” said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama. “In my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.”The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation. The committee’s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said this week that he aimed to finish witness interviews in the coming weeks and issue the last in a series of reports on the panel’s findings in the coming months.On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.Correction: March 28, 2019Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a congressman from Texas.

Barr’s assurances on Friday that he will produce a full, albeit redacted, copy of the nearly 400-page report to Congress by mid-April.“As I have made clear, Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence,” Mr. Nadler said in a statement. “The attorney general should reconsider so that we can work together to ensure the maximum transparency of this important report to both Congress and the American people.”The committee’s announcement came a day ahead of a deadline set by Mr. Nadler and five other House committee leaders for Mr. Barr to voluntarily hand over the material collected by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Barr appeared all but certain to miss it.The urgency among Democrats came, in part, because they mistrust Mr. Barr’s assessment of the report in a four-page letter he sent to Congress late last month. The letter said that Mr. Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 election, and that although Mr. Mueller did not offer a prosecutorial judgment on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Mr. Barr had determined the president’s actions were not illegal.Democrats control the Judiciary Committee by a sizable margin and most likely will not need Republican support to approve the subpoena. If approved, it would be up to Mr. Nadler to determine when and if to issue it — effectively increasing pressure on Mr. Barr to meet Democrats’ demands.The committee’s top Republican, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, appeared to oppose a subpoena on Monday, saying Democrats had grown “desperate” despite Mr. Barr providing “transparency above and beyond what is required.”“Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not, in truth, require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department,” Mr. Collins said in a statement.Indeed, in his Friday letter to Mr. Nadler and other congressional leaders, Mr. Barr wrote that the Justice Department and special counsel’s team were scrubbing the report to redact secret grand jury testimony, classified material and information about other continuing federal investigations. He also agreed to testify publicly in early May about his handling of the case.In addition to authorizing a subpoena for the Mueller report, the Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on subpoenas for five key witnesses in its investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration.The individuals are Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel who spoke extensively with Mr. Mueller’s investigators; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; Reince Priebus, the president’s first chief of staff; and Annie Donaldson, a deputy of Mr. McGahn who took detailed notes on the president’s behavior during key episodes in his administration.The five were among 81 individuals, companies and government entities from which the committee requested documents last month to kick-start its investigation. Mr. Nadler said he would not have to use the subpoenas if the witnesses changed course and complied voluntarily.

Barr, the attorney general, delivered his summary of the special counsel investigation to Congress on Sunday.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos, Adam Goldman and Katie BennerMarch 28, 2019WASHINGTON — The still-secret report on Russian interference in the 2016 election submitted last week by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department acknowledged on Thursday.Mr. Barr wrote to Congress on Sunday offering what he called the “principal conclusions” of the report — including that Mr. Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign had taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election. But he had notably declined to publicly disclose its length.The total of 300-plus pages suggests that Mr. Mueller went well beyond the kind of bare-bones summary required by the Justice Department regulation governing his appointment and detailed his conclusions at length. And it raises questions about what Mr. Barr might have left out of the four dense pages he sent to Congress.Answering those questions is likely to prove difficult for lawmakers and the public. Mr. Barr has indicated to two congressional chairmen that it will most likely take weeks to redact the report for classified and grand jury information the department deems unfit for public consumption.But Justice Department officials, including some from the attorney general’s office, could examine the report before sending any documents to Congress for possible material the president could claim as privileged, according to a department official.The practice is not unusual, but it would most likely create another tranche of material from Mr. Mueller’s investigation to be withheld from Congress and kick off a fight between lawmakers and the administration that would further delay a resolution. No plans have been made for a review, the official said, and it was not clear whether Mr. Barr would be personally involved.If the Justice Department were to deem certain aspects of Mr. Mueller’s report to be subject to executive privilege, Democrats in Congress would almost certainly contest the assertion and force Mr. Trump to actually claim the privilege — and risk a court challenge — or not. Law enforcement officials had no plans to show White House officials the report before it was sent to Congress, the Justice Department official said.Democrats, who like all other lawmakers have not seen the report, have already all but accused Mr. Barr of covering up damaging information it contains. They have specifically focused on an apparent difference between the views of Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Democrats have demanded that the attorney general make the full report and evidence public.“For Mr. Barr to quickly issue a four-page report in his attempt to try to exonerate Mr. Trump, and now to delay the release of an over 300-page report written by Mueller so the American people and we senators and congressmen can see what was written, has too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a speech on the chamber floor.Read Attorney General William Barr’s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter, by Attorney General William P. Barr, details the main findings of the special counsel’s two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Republicans have adopted a more trusting stance of Mr. Barr, indicating that they believe he will make appropriate judgments about what should and should not be shared.The new ballpark page length came about a week after a senior Justice Department official told reporters that the report was “comprehensive.”Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, added the description “very substantial” after talking to Mr. Barr on Wednesday, although neither he nor any other member of Congress has seen the report and he declined to give a page count. Andrew Napolitano, a legal analyst for Fox News and a favorite of Mr. Trump, caused a stir on Wednesday when he said multiple times on the air that the report was 700 pages.Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, confirmed the length of the document after The New York Times reported it, citing American officials who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss details of the report.Mr. Barr had told Mr. Nadler on their Wednesday call that the report was more than 300 pages long, Ms. Kupec said.Other blockbuster government reports in recent decades have been lengthy. At 445 pages, the independent counsel Ken Starr’s report on President Bill Clinton had to be trucked to Capitol Hill in September 1998.The 9/11 commission report ran 567 pages with notes on the circumstances and fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks.Even the Justice Department inspector general seems to have outwritten Mr. Mueller of late. Michael E. Horowitz released a scathing report last summer on the F.B.I.’s handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state that preoccupied Congress for weeks.Mr. Horowitz’s report was 568 pages.By contrast, the Watergate “road map” sent to Congress by the grand jury investigating President Richard M. Nixon and his associates was only 62 pages. Sent to lawmakers in 1974, the court report was not unsealed by a federal judge and made public until last year.Mr. Mueller probably collected and generated hundreds of thousands if not millions of pages of paper during his investigation. Congress has made clear it would eventually like access to all of them, but the Justice Department could have good reason to block the release of some, leaving it once again to the courts to determine who sees what.Members of Mr. Barr’s and Mr. Mueller’s teams are currently reviewing the full report to redact information that they do not believe should be made public for intelligence or other reasons. Mr. Barr has told lawmakers in recent days that it will take weeks to make more of Mr. Mueller’s findings public.

Mueller III.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesBy Mark Landler and Katie RogersMarch 28, 2019GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — President Trump, fresh off what he claims was “total vindication” in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, told supporters here Thursday he had vanquished a corrupt cabal of Democrats, the news media and the Washington elite, who tried to nullify his historic election victory by painting him as an agent of Russia.“After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump declared. “The collusion delusion is over.”In his first rally since the end of the 22-month investigation, the president gleefully disregarded the old saw about revenge being a dish best served cold. He came onstage hot and served up one scorching zinger after another, taking particular delight in ridiculing Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who oversees the House Intelligence Committee, and other Democrats who have led calls to investigate Mr. Trump.“They’re on artificial respirators right now,” Mr. Trump said, his voice dripping with contempt. “They’re giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He’s got the smallest, thinnest neck I’ve ever seen.”It was a calculated show of outrage by a president who has decided to seize on the Russia investigation to frame his ordeal as a conspiracy by his rivals to delegitimize him and diminish his achievements.Mr. Trump has always peppered his speeches with “hells” and “damns,” but on Thursday, he crossed the line into cruder language.“The Democrats need to decide whether they will continue to defraud the public with ridiculous bullshit,” the president said.In vilifying his opponents, Mr. Trump was not troubled by the fact that the 300-plus-page report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has yet to be released, or that Attorney General William P. Barr, in his summary of Mr. Mueller’s findings, stipulated that the report did not exonerate the president, even if it did not find him guilty of conspiracy or of obstructing justice.“It’s interesting,” Mr. Trump said. “Robert Mueller was a god to the Democrats. He was a god to them until he said ‘no collusion.’ They don’t like him so much now.”In many ways, the speech was a return to first principles for Mr. Trump, reviving an insurgent theme that had fueled his campaign in 2016. He said the Russia investigation underlined the need to “drain the swamp,” and he celebrated his cheering supporters over what he described as the faithless elites in Washington.“I’m president and they’re not,” he said.“They came, and they didn’t even know these people existed,” Mr. Trump said of the elites.“I have a better education than them. I’m smarter than them. I went to better schools than them,” he added. “Much more beautiful house. Much more beautiful everything.”Mr. Trump also went after the “fake news” media, celebrating what he claimed was a sharp decline in ratings for CNN and MSNBC after the Mueller findings were released, and predicting they would never regain their credibility.The president, however, made an exception for Fox News, praising the network’s lineup by its commentators’ first names: Sean (Hannity), Tucker (Carlson), and Jeanine (Pirro), noting with pleasure that “Jeanine is back!” — a reference to Ms. Pirro’s brief suspension after she made disparaging comments on the air about a congresswoman in Muslim dress.Mr. Trump called the investigation an extravagant waste of time that detracted from an administration that he insisted had compiled a sterling record.“The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally gain power by framing innocent Americans,” he declared. “Despite this phony corrupt disgusting cloud we’ve done more together in the first two years than any administration in history.”Grand Rapids holds special meaning for Mr. Trump, as the site of his final campaign rally before his upset victory in 2016. He won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes — two-tenths of 1 percent — the first Republican to do so since 1988. It was one of three Midwestern states — along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that cemented his victory over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Grand Rapids was also the hometown of another president, Gerald R. Ford, whose presidential museum sits across the river from the arena where Mr. Trump spoke — a monument to the moderate Republicanism that the president has banished and the Washington establishment that he has upended.The timing of the rally so soon after Mr. Barr’s disclosures prompted greater-than-usual concerns about security, given Mr. Trump’s habit of stirring up the crowd and heaping abuse on reporters. At his last rally in El Paso, a member of the audience assaulted a BBC cameraman.The signs of tighter security in Grand Rapids included more visible security personnel and sturdier barriers between the news media and the audience. In El Paso, reporters were seated in the stands, unprotected from the crowd.The mood in the arena, however, was no more intense than at other Trump rallies. If anything, the crowd seemed a bit sedate as he began speaking. Many held up signs that said “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs,” reflecting the economic priorities that drive voting in this Rust Belt state.And for all his indignation at the start of the speech, Mr. Trump lapsed into well-worn themes later in the one hour and 22-minute speech, even delivering a leisurely reminiscence about his election victory.“Bill Clinton said ‘you better get up to Michigan,’” Mr. Trump said in an interlude that mocked the former president’s efforts to convince Mrs. Clinton’s advisers to pay more attention to the state. “And do you remember, this was my last stop?”On Sunday evening, after Mr. Barr delivered his summary of the Mueller report, the president, who was in Palm Beach, Fla., was urged by his aides to avoid a tone of triumphalism in his reaction. That lasted for about an hour, until he delivered an angry denunciation of those behind the investigation before he returned to Washington.As the days wore on, Mr. Trump took aim at news organizations and demanded the resignation of Democrats like Mr. Schiff, whom he accused of lying repeatedly in discussing potential collusion between Mr. Trump and the Russians.In a warm-up rally more than an hour before Mr. Trump arrived, Laura Cox, the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, led the crowd in chants of “No Collusion! No Obstruction!” The crowd also chanted “Lock her up!” after Ms. Cox denounced Mrs. Clinton for counting Harvey Weinstein as one of her supporters.On the flight to Grand Rapids, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, two former campaign advisers known for riling up Mr. Trump on Air Force One before his rallies, were aboard.Inside the White House, aides were concerned about the two of them tagging along — and possibly having open access to the president — but ultimately did not take steps to limit their travel, according to a person familiar with the planning.Mr. Trump has long savored his victory in Michigan. But the state could be more of an uphill struggle in 2020. Democrats made significant gains in the 2018 midterm elections, including winning the governorship.General Motors, one of Michigan’s key employers, has laid off workers, despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure the carmaker to expand manufacturing in the United States. He also faces headwinds in winning congressional passage of the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he has promoted as benefiting workers in Michigan.Inside the arena, however, Mr. Trump’s supporters basked in the glow of the president’s claims of vindication and expressed indignation on his behalf at the proliferating investigations into him and his administration.“He went through so much persecution,” said Brenda Freye, a medical assistant from nearby Muskegon, who recalled attending his campaign rally here in November 2016. “They were so unfair to him.”Correction: March 28, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the significance of Grand Rapids, Mich., to Gerald R. Ford. It was his hometown, not his birthplace. An earlier version also misstated the year a Republican won Michigan in a presidential election.

In his letter to the chairmen of the congressional judiciary committees, above, Mr. Barr added that the White House would not see the document before he sent it to Congress.He plans to testify on Capitol Hill in early May, shortly after the report is released, to discuss it with lawmakers.In other news out of Washington, President Trump warned he would close the Mexican border “next week” over immigration, escalating a repeated threat — but one he has not acted on._____ImageCreditKirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press2. Brexit is in ruins: Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan for a third time, just two weeks before the April 12 date to leave the E.U.The vote effectively sets the process back to square one almost three years after Britons voted to leave. On Monday, Parliament will try to muster a majority for an alternative path to leaving the bloc, and then challenge Mrs. May to make it work.If that fails, the country faces the very real possibility of leaving the E.U. without a deal, which many fear will have grave economic implications, or requesting another extension from the bloc’s leaders.One man is trying to make sense of Brexit, one flowchart at a time. He would like to stop now._____ImageCreditIvan Alvarado/Reuters3. Venezuela agreed to let the Red Cross deliver aid. It’s the first tacit admission by President Nicolás Maduro of a humanitarian crisis.Access to and the distribution of basic supplies have become a main battleground between Mr. Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, who have both attempted to control supplies of aid for political advantage. The Red Cross, pictured above in Caracas, said it would begin delivery of medical supplies as soon as mid-April.In other international news, we visited a camp in Syria where women and children who fled ISIS territory are stuck in limbo after the group’s collapse._____ImageCreditMike Blake/Reuters3. Lyft began trading at $87 a share, soaring above its public offering price and reflecting investor demand for fast-growing tech companies.Some of the gains faded soon after the debut, but at the I.P.O. price, Lyft had a market value of over $24 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade.As unicorn companies like Lyft ride into the public markets, their elite early investors will be the biggest winners. But not everyone who invested in the company is reaping the spoils._____ImageCreditGregg Vigliotti for The New York Times5. A measles outbreak among ultra-Orthodox Jews is spreading fear and stoking tensions with secular neighbors in a New York suburb.The authorities in Rockland County declared a state of emergency over the outbreak and have traced the spread of measles to ultra-Orthodox families whose children have not been vaccinated.

Prison transport companies have been involved in more than 50 crashes, 60 escapes and 19 deaths since 2000. But no one holds them accountable — even when people die.Federal agencies that are supposed to oversee the industry almost never act, and because the vans, like the one pictured above, cross state and county lines, local officials can say they don’t have jurisdiction.In conjunction with The Marshall Project, we took a look at how one company has dodged responsibility for one inmate, Johnny Smith, who was charged with possession of a single oxycodone pill. He died in the back of a prison van in 2011. The for-profit company owes his family $650,000, and it still hasn’t paid._____ImageCreditMatt Rourke/Associated Press7.

Moving on to the lost history of one of the world’s strangest science experiments, and one of our most read stories today:In a news analysis in this weekend’s Sunday Review, our science columnist Carl Zimmer takes a look at the significance of Biosphere 2, which opened in 1991 in Arizona. Its geodesic domes and pyramids contained a miniature rain forest, a mangrove, a desert, a coral reef — and eight people, sealed inside to see if they could survive. Above, candidates for the Biosphere 2 with test modules in 1988.“The project would later be dismissed as a folly and a waste of effort,” he writes. “And yet, 25 years on, it’s an experiment worth rediscovering.

Finally, a grumpy cat mystery is solved.For three decades, bright orange novelty phones shaped like the cartoon cat Garfield kept washing up on the shoreline of Brittany, in western France.

And can both be satisfied?What is the backstop and why is it a factor?Ireland and Northern Ireland have recently enjoyed cooperation across their shared border, which for decades had been a pressure point in sectarian struggles known as “The Troubles.”A 1998 peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement mostly ended the conflict between Republicans, usually Roman Catholics, who believed that the six counties of the north should be part of a united Ireland; and historically dominant Unionists, largely Protestants, who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.In the years since the peace accord, the shared economy of the European Union made way for free trade and easy movement across a boundary that is now nearly invisible.The backstop is a number of temporary measures that would be put in place until Britain and the European Union reach a long-term trade agreement that would obviate the need for a physical border.Under those measures, Britain would stay in the European customs union (not charging tariffs on European products) and Northern Ireland would follow many rules of the single market (obeying many European product and food standards, for example).For unionists, that is virtually an existential threat, because the measures would bind Northern Ireland more tightly to European rules than they would the rest of the United Kingdom, which they fear would lead ultimately to unification with the South.[Read more here on the details of the Irish backstop.]ImageA cattle auction in Ballyjamesduff, Ireland. Dublin wants to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the European single market and the customs union.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesWhat does Ireland want?Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach of Ireland, as the prime minister is known, has said that the backstop is an essential part of any withdrawal agreement.On Tuesday, Mr. Varadkar told reporters in Paris that a no-deal scenario would put Ireland in a “difficult situation.” He reiterated his long standing assertion that his country’s twin objectives were to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union. The best way to do that, he said, was with the current backstop agreement.They are the foundation “on which Ireland’s economic model, our jobs and prosperity have been based for many decades now,” Mr. Varadkar said.ImageBritish flags outside a house in Belfast, Northern Ireland, last year.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesWhat does Northern Ireland want?Members of the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., oppose any language in the Brexit deal that suggests a special status for Northern Ireland, arguing that the designation could threaten to break up the United Kingdom.But the objectives of Northern Ireland as a whole are a bit more opaque, made more complicated by the fact that the region has been without a government for two years. While Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, it has its own legislature in Stormont, Belfast.As a result of the same Good Friday agreement that brokered peace in Northern Ireland, the government must be a power-sharing coalition between two parties. But two years ago, a disagreement between the two governing parties at the time — the D.U.P. and the republican Sinn Fein party — led to the dissolution of the government in Stormont.A new government is yet to be formed. While the D.U.P. has been able to exert influence in London as part of Prime Minister Theresa May’s governing coalition, the broader interests of the region have not always been represented.Sinn Fein lawmakers, who refuse to take their seats in the British Parliament, now worry that a no-deal Brexit would mean Northern Ireland’s decisions end up being made entirely in London in a return of the “direct rule” that the Good Friday agreement was intended to end. Britain’s top civil servant on Tuesday indicated that was a possibility, which drew ire from Sinn Fein.Complicating matters is the fact that a majority of Northern Irish voters — 55.8 percent — voted to remain in the European Union.Can there be compromise?It’s not looking likely.Sammy Wilson, a D.U.P. member of Parliament, recently said that even if Mrs. May brought her deal back 1,000 times, “we will vote against it.” He demanded that the prime minister “only sign an agreement which treats Northern Ireland the same as the rest of the United Kingdom.”Senior members of Mrs. May’s Conservative party were said to be dangling something called a ‘‘Stormont lock’’ to win the backing of unionists. That would be a domestic law saying that, if Northern Ireland had to adjust its rules to conform to European standards, then so would the rest of the United Kingdom.But unionist leaders sounded unconvinced. They cautioned that an international treaty with a backstop — the Brexit deal — would take precedence over domestic measures trying to avoid one.Correction: April 3, 2019Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Clones.

This is “The Daily.” Today, after months of trying and failing to put forward a deal for how the U.K. could leave the European Union, Theresa May had one final thing to offer: herself. It’s Monday, April 1.automated attendantThank you for calling the London office of The New York Times.ellen barryHello?michael barbaroOh, hello. How are you, Ellen?ellen barryI’m great.michael barbaroI’m so sorry that we’ve had technical difficulties this morning.ellen barryNot to worry.michael barbaroIt wouldn’t be “The Daily” if we didn’t have a little technical difficulty. O.K., so here we go, Ellen. Tell me when you are ready.ellen barryReady.michael barbaroO.K. Ellen Barry is a Times correspondent in London.ellen barrySo last Wednesday, in the middle of the day, Theresa May called her party members to Committee Room 14, which is a big committee room somewhere in the bowels of Westminster Palace. It was quite unclear what this was about. There was loads of speculation that she would perhaps fire her chief negotiator for Brexit, who is widely despised by right-wingers in her party.archived recordingThe world’s cameras are trained on the British Parliament, waiting for a Brexit breakthrough. For many, the workings of this House appear increasingly mystifying. But after months of Brexit paralysis, could things be starting to move?ellen barrySo at five o’clock, Conservative lawmakers began crowding into this room. And it was, by all accounts, stifling and completely packed. The minister for international development couldn’t even get in there and was watching through the keyhole. And it is traditional in these gatherings that when the prime minister comes in, people bang on the tables with their hands. It’s kind of like a tribal drumbeat. And so then, the room went silent. The door closed. The room went silent. And what was said in there was said only to each other. But meetings like this leak like sieves. And —archived recordingIn a closed meeting with conservative M.P.s, Theresa May said she’s prepared to make the ultimate move.ellen barryGradually, the outside world came to know that the thing that she was prepared to offer in exchange for their votes was herself.archived recordingShe concluded by asking everyone in the room to back her deal to allow for a smooth and orderly Brexit.ellen barryShe basically said, I’ll make you a deal. If you vote for this, if you vote for the withdrawal agreement and get it through, then I will step down as prime minister.michael barbaroBrexit for my head.ellen barryBasically.michael barbaroEllen, how did all of this happen? How did Theresa may end up being at the center of Brexit?ellen barrySo the funny thing is that Brexit was never Theresa May’s issue. She kind of kept her head down, but she was a Remainer. She voted to stay inside the European Union and really just stayed out of the whole public debate over Brexit, to a great extent. And it was really somewhat by accident that she became prime minister.archived recordingDavid Cameron is back in Downing Street, a happy man after a surprise election victory. Against most predictions, his party has won a slim but outright majority.ellen barryIt started with David Cameron, who was basically hoping to stop a hemorrhage of M.P.s from switching sides and going to UKIP, which was the Brexit party.archived recording (david cameron)We will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice.ellen barryAnd he made a gamble.archived recording (david cameron)To stay in the European Union on these new terms or to come out altogether. It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time for us to settle this question about Britain and Europe.ellen barryIt was essentially to kind of assuage the hard right of his party. He thought he could essentially throw them a bone and get them onside. And he did so expecting that the country would vote to remain. And it just came as a staggering surprise on June 23rd of 2016 when the results came out. And it was 52 to 48 percent for leaving the European Union.archived recording (david cameron)The British people have voted to leave the European Union. And their will must be respected.ellen barryAnd because David Cameron had been squarely opposed to leaving the European Union, he then announced that he was going to step down as prime minister, rather than lead the country through the process of leaving.archived recording (david cameron)I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months. But I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.michael barbaroSo why does Theresa May end up taking his place, if she had been a Remainer — if she’d been opposed to Brexit?ellen barrySo Theresa May ended up taking his place because the men who were the obvious front-runners to be his successors took each other out in the political fistfight that followed. And I suppose she was appealing in a sense that she was quite different from all of those top Tory men. There’s a phrase they use at Balliol College, which is “the tranquil assurance of effortless superiority.”archived recording (theresa may)Some people would say, sometimes, life as a vicar’s daughter isn’t — it can have its ups and downs.ellen barryTheresa May is nothing like that — I mean, not on any level.archived recording (theresa may)But I feel hugely privileged, actually, in the childhood that I had.ellen barryShe was the daughter of a small-town vicar, and the granddaughter of two lady’s maids, and the great-granddaughter of a butler. So she came from a family with a really long sense of public service and duty.archived recordingWhat’s the naughtiest thing you ever did?archived recording (theresa may)Oh, goodness me. Well, I suppose, gosh. Do you know? I’m not quite sure.archived recordingThere must have been a moment.archived recording (theresa may)Well, nobody’s ever perfectly behaved, are they? I have to confess when me and my friends used to run through the fields of wheat, the farmers weren’t too pleased about that.ellen barrySo she seemed like one of the grown-ups in the room, at the time. Someone who could potentially bring the country back together after an incredibly difficult and divisive referendum campaign.michael barbaroSo the men who create Brexit essentially self-immolate. And the party turns to Theresa May.ellen barryYes. She cast herself as someone who was trying to do the least damage. I mean, instead of projecting enthusiasm about the mission of Brexit, she tended to express a sense of duty that she had taken on the job. She was going to finish the job.archived recording (theresa may)We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know, because we are Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge.ellen barryBut it didn’t take long for her to start making serious blunders around Brexit, because it turned out that she is one of the worst retail politicians that Britain has ever seen.archived recording (theresa may)I know that the public sector has had to carry a heavy burden. The private sector has played its part, too. But with government, businesses and the public sector working together, we have bounced back.ellen barryShe is wooden. She is unable to speak off-script. She cannot generate warmth. She seems congenitally unable to generate warmth.archived recording (theresa may)Brexit means Brexit. And we are going to make a success of it.ellen barryShe went out on the stump and repeated, kind of robotically —archived recording (theresa may)Brexit means Brexit.ellen barry— a set of phrases that she had been briefed on.archived recording (theresa may)Because Brexit means Brexit.ellen barryAnd she earned the nickname the “Maybot,” because she was seemingly unable to come up with different answers, even when the same question was asked her repeatedly.archived recording (theresa may)Well, the reason I’ve been saying Brexit means Brexit is precisely because it does. And to be very clear —archived recordingThis is what history looks like. The official letter formally starting the process of Britain leaving the European Union is delivered.ellen barrySo she made a series of very significant blunders that year. One of them, maybe the most important one, is that she triggered Article 50.archived recording (theresa may)The Article 50 process is now underway. And in accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.ellen barryWhich started the clock ticking towards an end date — an exit date of March 29.archived recording (theresa may)This is an historic moment, from which there can be no turning back. Britain is leaving the European Union. We are going to make our own decisions and our own laws.ellen barryAs soon as she started that, the E.U. had an enormous advantage in the negotiations.archived recording (theresa may)This is a decisive step, which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly. But I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.ellen barryShe also, as a general matter, played her cards incredibly close to her vest throughout the negotiation. So the country really didn’t know where she was going with this process until quite late last year, when she shared her withdrawal agreement with the country.archived recording (theresa may)When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear: this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings about control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union, or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.ellen barryAnd it went over like a lead balloon.michael barbaroAnd why was that?ellen barryWell, she laid out a series of red lines that were, in fact, very hard Brexit red lines. No one knew, up until that point, that she was planning to exit the customs union and the single market.archived recording (theresa may)And because we will no longer be members of the single market, we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the E.U. budget. The days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.michael barbaroAnd why is that, ultimately, a blunder?ellen barryWell, they had no solution for what would turn out to be the fatal problem with that plan, which is Britain is not an island. There is a land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. And you cannot just walk away from the customs union without creating some kind of a border. And of course, that open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic had been the subject of a 30-year armed struggle and a hard-fought peace agreement. So to gloss over it was not looking at the problem, which was going to block this thing at the end.archived recording (theresa may)The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop.ellen barryBut the way she squared the circle with the Irish border is to create something called the backstop. And what the backstop means is that the entire of the U.K. would remain in the customs union until such a time that there is a solution to the border problem, which could easily be never. And this is why she lost her Brexiteers. Because they said, well, this is just a way for us to stay in the European Union, subject to their regulations, indefinitely, because there is no provision for the United Kingdom leaving the backstop unilaterally. So they just saw themselves as being stuck at the mercy of Europe indefinitely.michael barbaroWow, that’s the first time I understood the backstop. Thank you.archived recording 1The fact is that her deal isn’t really a deal. Because what it actually does is postpone everything. It doesn’t settle anything. It actually guarantees more uncertainty, which is terrible for business. And it’s not even Brexit.archived recording 2It is not Brexit at all. And they’re pretending that it is.ellen barrySo what she begins to do is try to persuade the country to compromise. But it is extremely late in the game. And she hasn’t laid the groundwork for a compromise. Much of her energy went to keeping the hardliners onside. And as soon as she published her withdrawal agreement, she lost them.archived recordingTheresa May still believes there’s a battle to be won in Brussels. A growing number of British M.P.s don’t. The view from Europe is of a nation increasingly at odds with itself.michael barbaroAnd how does may respond to all these condemnations and men who are essentially beating her up?ellen barryThis is such an irritating, maddening group of people that — I don’t know. A lot of Britons, during this period, their heart went out to her. Because any normal person would just throw their hands up and walk away from this nightmare of a job. But she’d just wake up in the morning and dust herself off and set aside her personal feelings and say —archived recording (theresa may)I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.ellen barry— again and again —archived recording (theresa may)From the very beginning, I have known what I wanted to deliver for the British people to honor their vote in the referendum.ellen barry— I have committed to delivering Brexit to the British people.archived recording (theresa may)The British people just want us to get on with it.

So bring us back to this Committee Room number 14. What do we know about what Theresa May said as she offered her own head to members of the Conservative Party as this final gesture?ellen barryThis was the way it was described by George Freeman, who was her former policy adviser. “She, with tears not far from her eyes, said, ‘I promised I would deliver the Brexit agreement.’” She said, “I’ve made many mistakes. I’m only human. I beg you, colleagues, vote for the withdrawal agreement. And I will go.” He said there was silence in the room. And it was incredibly sad.[music]ellen barryAfter she finished speaking in this committee room, there were several M.P.s who were hardline, holdout Brexiteers who got up and said, publicly, that they were now going to back her deal.michael barbaroWow, so this seems to be working?ellen barryYes. For the next 45 minutes to an hour, journalists were on Twitter just counting the number of Brexiteers that were changing sides. And you had people like Boris Johnson, who — I think he had compared her deal to a suicide vest at one point. This is what he said to The Daily Telegraph: “I feel very, very sorry. And though it fills me with pain, I’m going to have to support this thing.” So he flipped sides. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Brexiteer bannerman, tweeted out that “half a loaf is better than no bread.” In other words, he was willing to give up some of his Brexiteer credibility to get behind Theresa May and give her his vote. And you just began to see this happening again and again. They were flipping. And I think it got up to something like 30 or 40 people were indicating that they were changing sides. And it looked, somehow, that at this last moment, in this last Hail Mary pass that she had thrown by offering her resignation, she might have just gotten it over the line.archived recording (john bercow)Order.

The implications of the House’s decision are grave.michael barbaroSo this offer to give up her own prime ministership in exchange for Brexit — essentially, Parliament said to her, not even that is enough.ellen barryIt wasn’t enough.archived recordingGood evening from Westminster. If the prime minister had had her way, the United Kingdom would be leaving the E.U. in one hour’s time. Today should have been Brexit Day. That’s what Theresa May had promised. But instead, she —ellen barryAnd this is the absurd trap that we’ve all been in — that here is an impossible task that doesn’t get done and doesn’t get done. And yet nothing changes. There’s no off-ramp. And so Brexit still isn’t done. And Theresa May’s still the person in charge of it. You imagine that she was ready to walk away. And you could see it on her face. She looked like a different person. She looked younger. She looked — I don’t know. She just didn’t look strained anymore. But actually, she’s not free. It’s not done. And she’s going to have to start all over again, in the morning.michael barbaroEllen, thank you very much. We appreciate it.ellen barryThank you.[music]michael barbaroHere’s what else you need to know, today.archived recording (donald trump)I’ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.michael barbaroOver the weekend, the Trump Administration said it would drastically cut financial aid to three Central American countries in retaliation for what he said was their failure to stop the flow of migrants to the U.S. border.archived recording (donald trump)We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us.michael barbaroThe $500 million in aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras was originally designed to address the root cause of migration — violence, lack of jobs and poverty. And its elimination could ultimately backfire, triggering even more migration to the U.S. And New York will become the first city in the country to charge drivers for using its streets, in an attempt to reduce congestion and raise money to repair its subway system.archived recording (andrew cuomo)You have to get fewer cars driving into Manhattan. The traffic is so bad. I can’t tell you how many days, myself, I just get out of the car and walk. Because it’s so much faster.michael barbaroUnder a plan adopted by Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature on Sunday, drivers will be charged a fee of at least $10 to drive below 60th Street in Manhattan.archived recording (andrew cuomo)Buses in Manhattan, I think the average is now down to, like, four miles per hour.michael barbaroThe fees, known as congestion pricing, are already in use in London, Stockholm and Singapore, where they have cut both traffic and air pollution. In New York, they are expected to raise $1 billion a year for the city’s subway system.archived recording (andrew cuomo)And it’s a little bit of a chicken and an egg. You need a viable, functioning mass transit system so people get out of their cars and feel comfortable taking the mass transit system. And that’s the point behind congestion pricing.[music]michael barbaroThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.But despite asking Parliament to vote on only half of her deal — the immediate divorce terms — Mrs. May’s gamble failed.On Monday, it will be Parliament’s turn again. Lawmakers will try to tighten their grip over the process, with the aim of mustering a majority for an alternative path, and then challenging Mrs. May to make it work.“The implications of the House’s decision are grave,” said Mrs. May, after her loss by the emphatic margin of 58 votes. “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.”That was taken as a hint that she is contemplating a general election that would shake up the composition of the House of Commons. But Mrs. May refused to be more specific.Mrs. May’s plan would eventually take Britain out of Europe’s main economic structures but give it control over immigration from continental Europe. Brexit hard-liners fear her plan could still keep Britain too closely tied to the bloc, while pro-European critics prefer closer, long-term trading links with Europe, or no Brexit at all.ImagePro-Brexit supporters outside Parliament on Friday.CreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesIf Parliament remains deadlocked next week, Britain will face a stark choice: either run headlong into a no-deal Brexit on the new deadline of April 12, or return to Brussels to request another extension from the bloc’s leaders.But as European leaders made clear two weeks ago, the government will have to put forth a strong reason for the delay — presumably time to hold either a general election or, less likely, a second public vote on Brexit, as the process of leaving the European Union is known.In something of a last-ditch effort, the prime minister this week had promised lawmakers that she would step down if her plan were approved, giving Conservatives a chance to choose a leader more to their liking to oversee the next round of negotiations.But with her deal thwarted again, there was no sign she intended to go anywhere.[Interested in our Brexit coverage? Join the conversation on April 1, and hear how our reporters in London are tracking these updates.]In a statement, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, warned that “a ‘no deal’ scenario is now a likely scenario.” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the group of the bloc’s leaders, called a council meeting on April 10, two days before the next Brexit deadline.The opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on lawmakers to take over the process.“On Monday, this House has the chance, and I say to all members, the responsibility, to find a majority for a better deal for all the people of this country,” he said.On Friday Parliament voted on the part of Mrs. May’s plan that covers the nuts and bolts of the withdrawal, including the divorce payment; the rights of the bloc’s citizens living in Britain; and the infamous Irish “backstop,” or how the border between Ireland, part of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, will be kept open.Lawmakers did not vote on the other half of her deal, a nonbinding “political declaration” about future ties with the bloc.For a while it seemed as if Mrs. May’s choreographing of the vote to turn up the pressure on recalcitrant members of Parliament might work.ImageA marching band parading past the Parliament, the scene of protests on Friday.CreditPeter Summers/Getty ImagesThroughout the day, one prominent Tory Brexiteer after another professed support for a plan that some of them had said would turn Britain into a slave or vassal state.Among them was Dominic Raab, a former lead Brexit negotiator for the government and one of the most hard-line Conservative supporters of withdrawal.Writing on Twitter, Boris Johnson, a former foreign secretary who had been perhaps the most vocal critic of Mrs. May’s proposal, said he would support it, although it was “very painful to vote for this deal.”But the prime minister’s putative allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, whose opinion many pro-Brexit Tories considered determinative, resisted Mrs. May’s entreaties to the end.Their fear was that the deal would leave Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the European Union and cleaved from the rest of the United Kingdom.In the end, Mrs. May lost by 344 votes to 286, a slightly more respectable total than the two previous rejections, of 230 and 149 votes, but still a big margin.Mrs. May had hoped the vote would at least show that she was close to winning over Parliament. Instead it underscored the fact that nothing has been resolved two years after a formal exit process began amid much fanfare, only to descend into a shambles.For Brexit supporters, March 29 was, once upon a time, supposed to be a big party, with a celebration at 11 p.m.Some wanted Big Ben, currently silenced for renovation, to emerge from the scaffolding to chime Britain out of the European Union, sounding the death knell for 45 years of integrating with Europe. A commemorative coin was planned by the Royal Mint.ImageHundreds of thousands of protesters gathering in London last weekend to demand a public vote on the government’s final Brexit deal.CreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesSo for the pro-Brexit activists who hollered “Shame on you!” in Parliament Square on Friday, Parliament’s vote represented no less than the undoing of British democracy.“I dearly wish we could be toasting Britain’s freedom with Champagne at 11 p.m. on Friday, just as we’d planned,” said Allison Pearson, a columnist for the stridently pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph.“Under the circumstances, half a glass of Tizer and Nurofen is more like it,” she said, referring to a British soft drink and a painkiller.Among pro-Europeans, many of whom turned out in the hundreds of thousands for a march in London last weekend, the vote was the clearest sign yet that lawmakers were heeding a shift in public opinion toward remaining in the Europe Union and seizing control from an unyielding prime minister.On Twitter, pro-Europeans had a “non-Brexit” celebration. “Off to Glasgow to celebrate non-#Brexit day with fellow remainers,” read one.“Happy Brexit day everyone!,” read another. “I’m going to celebrate by eating my non bendy bananas, drinking some English sparkling wine & stroking my blue passport!”For businesses, Friday’s vote was a sobering moment as most of them have no idea what tariffs could apply to imports and exports next month.There are no good options left for Mrs. May. To hold another vote on her deal, she needs the permission of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, who has warned her that she cannot hold a vote on something that has already been rejected.She could ask the European Union for a longer extension, blaming her political opponents for keeping Britain in the bloc by opposing her deal. But that would mean going back on a central pledge to end ties quickly.And if she were to try to proceed with a no-deal Brexit, Parliament would surely try to stop her, as a clear majority of lawmakers oppose that outcome.As with so much about Brexit, though, how such a move would work in practice remains unclear.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: On Brexit Day, May’s Plan Endures a 3rd Defeat.

More striking is the deep cynicism among those who voted to leave, the group that Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to satisfy. They are now equally bitter and disillusioned, as the government’s paralysis has called into question whether Britain will ever leave.Parliament’s rejection of Mrs. May’s withdrawal plan on Friday — for the third time — means the turbulence will continue.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: The Agony of Being Theresa MayIn a last-ditch effort to fulfill her promise of delivering Brexit, Britain’s prime minister dangled a final sacrifice.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/22:22-22:22transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: The Agony of Being Theresa MayHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Theo Balcomb, Lynsea Garrison and Annie Brown, and edited by Lisa TobinIn a last-ditch effort to fulfill her promise of delivering Brexit, Britain’s prime minister dangled a final sacrifice.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, after months of trying and failing to put forward a deal for how the U.K. could leave the European Union, Theresa May had one final thing to offer: herself. It’s Monday, April 1.automated attendantThank you for calling the London office of The New York Times.ellen barryHello?michael barbaroOh, hello. How are you, Ellen?ellen barryI’m great.michael barbaroI’m so sorry that we’ve had technical difficulties this morning.ellen barryNot to worry.michael barbaroIt wouldn’t be “The Daily” if we didn’t have a little technical difficulty. O.K., so here we go, Ellen. Tell me when you are ready.ellen barryReady.michael barbaroO.K. Ellen Barry is a Times correspondent in London.ellen barrySo last Wednesday, in the middle of the day, Theresa May called her party members to Committee Room 14, which is a big committee room somewhere in the bowels of Westminster Palace. It was quite unclear what this was about. There was loads of speculation that she would perhaps fire her chief negotiator for Brexit, who is widely despised by right-wingers in her party.archived recordingThe world’s cameras are trained on the British Parliament, waiting for a Brexit breakthrough. For many, the workings of this House appear increasingly mystifying. But after months of Brexit paralysis, could things be starting to move?ellen barrySo at five o’clock, Conservative lawmakers began crowding into this room. And it was, by all accounts, stifling and completely packed. The minister for international development couldn’t even get in there and was watching through the keyhole. And it is traditional in these gatherings that when the prime minister comes in, people bang on the tables with their hands. It’s kind of like a tribal drumbeat. And so then, the room went silent. The door closed. The room went silent. And what was said in there was said only to each other. But meetings like this leak like sieves. And —archived recordingIn a closed meeting with conservative M.P.s, Theresa May said she’s prepared to make the ultimate move.ellen barryGradually, the outside world came to know that the thing that she was prepared to offer in exchange for their votes was herself.archived recordingShe concluded by asking everyone in the room to back her deal to allow for a smooth and orderly Brexit.ellen barryShe basically said, I’ll make you a deal. If you vote for this, if you vote for the withdrawal agreement and get it through, then I will step down as prime minister.michael barbaroBrexit for my head.ellen barryBasically.michael barbaroEllen, how did all of this happen? How did Theresa may end up being at the center of Brexit?ellen barrySo the funny thing is that Brexit was never Theresa May’s issue. She kind of kept her head down, but she was a Remainer. She voted to stay inside the European Union and really just stayed out of the whole public debate over Brexit, to a great extent. And it was really somewhat by accident that she became prime minister.archived recordingDavid Cameron is back in Downing Street, a happy man after a surprise election victory. Against most predictions, his party has won a slim but outright majority.ellen barryIt started with David Cameron, who was basically hoping to stop a hemorrhage of M.P.s from switching sides and going to UKIP, which was the Brexit party.archived recording (david cameron)We will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice.ellen barryAnd he made a gamble.archived recording (david cameron)To stay in the European Union on these new terms or to come out altogether. It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time for us to settle this question about Britain and Europe.ellen barryIt was essentially to kind of assuage the hard right of his party. He thought he could essentially throw them a bone and get them onside. And he did so expecting that the country would vote to remain. And it just came as a staggering surprise on June 23rd of 2016 when the results came out. And it was 52 to 48 percent for leaving the European Union.archived recording (david cameron)The British people have voted to leave the European Union. And their will must be respected.ellen barryAnd because David Cameron had been squarely opposed to leaving the European Union, he then announced that he was going to step down as prime minister, rather than lead the country through the process of leaving.archived recording (david cameron)I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months. But I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.michael barbaroSo why does Theresa May end up taking his place, if she had been a Remainer — if she’d been opposed to Brexit?ellen barrySo Theresa May ended up taking his place because the men who were the obvious front-runners to be his successors took each other out in the political fistfight that followed. And I suppose she was appealing in a sense that she was quite different from all of those top Tory men. There’s a phrase they use at Balliol College, which is “the tranquil assurance of effortless superiority.”archived recording (theresa may)Some people would say, sometimes, life as a vicar’s daughter isn’t — it can have its ups and downs.ellen barryTheresa May is nothing like that — I mean, not on any level.archived recording (theresa may)But I feel hugely privileged, actually, in the childhood that I had.ellen barryShe was the daughter of a small-town vicar, and the granddaughter of two lady’s maids, and the great-granddaughter of a butler. So she came from a family with a really long sense of public service and duty.archived recordingWhat’s the naughtiest thing you ever did?archived recording (theresa may)Oh, goodness me. Well, I suppose, gosh. Do you know? I’m not quite sure.archived recordingThere must have been a moment.archived recording (theresa may)Well, nobody’s ever perfectly behaved, are they? I have to confess when me and my friends used to run through the fields of wheat, the farmers weren’t too pleased about that.ellen barrySo she seemed like one of the grown-ups in the room, at the time. Someone who could potentially bring the country back together after an incredibly difficult and divisive referendum campaign.michael barbaroSo the men who create Brexit essentially self-immolate. And the party turns to Theresa May.ellen barryYes. She cast herself as someone who was trying to do the least damage. I mean, instead of projecting enthusiasm about the mission of Brexit, she tended to express a sense of duty that she had taken on the job. She was going to finish the job.archived recording (theresa may)We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know, because we are Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge.ellen barryBut it didn’t take long for her to start making serious blunders around Brexit, because it turned out that she is one of the worst retail politicians that Britain has ever seen.archived recording (theresa may)I know that the public sector has had to carry a heavy burden. The private sector has played its part, too. But with government, businesses and the public sector working together, we have bounced back.ellen barryShe is wooden. She is unable to speak off-script. She cannot generate warmth. She seems congenitally unable to generate warmth.archived recording (theresa may)Brexit means Brexit. And we are going to make a success of it.ellen barryShe went out on the stump and repeated, kind of robotically —archived recording (theresa may)Brexit means Brexit.ellen barry— a set of phrases that she had been briefed on.archived recording (theresa may)Because Brexit means Brexit.ellen barryAnd she earned the nickname the “Maybot,” because she was seemingly unable to come up with different answers, even when the same question was asked her repeatedly.archived recording (theresa may)Well, the reason I’ve been saying Brexit means Brexit is precisely because it does. And to be very clear —archived recordingThis is what history looks like. The official letter formally starting the process of Britain leaving the European Union is delivered.ellen barrySo she made a series of very significant blunders that year. One of them, maybe the most important one, is that she triggered Article 50.archived recording (theresa may)The Article 50 process is now underway. And in accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.ellen barryWhich started the clock ticking towards an end date — an exit date of March 29.archived recording (theresa may)This is an historic moment, from which there can be no turning back. Britain is leaving the European Union. We are going to make our own decisions and our own laws.ellen barryAs soon as she started that, the E.U. had an enormous advantage in the negotiations.archived recording (theresa may)This is a decisive step, which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly. But I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.ellen barryShe also, as a general matter, played her cards incredibly close to her vest throughout the negotiation. So the country really didn’t know where she was going with this process until quite late last year, when she shared her withdrawal agreement with the country.archived recording (theresa may)When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear: this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings about control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union, or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.ellen barryAnd it went over like a lead balloon.michael barbaroAnd why was that?ellen barryWell, she laid out a series of red lines that were, in fact, very hard Brexit red lines. No one knew, up until that point, that she was planning to exit the customs union and the single market.archived recording (theresa may)And because we will no longer be members of the single market, we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the E.U. budget. The days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.michael barbaroAnd why is that, ultimately, a blunder?ellen barryWell, they had no solution for what would turn out to be the fatal problem with that plan, which is Britain is not an island. There is a land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. And you cannot just walk away from the customs union without creating some kind of a border. And of course, that open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic had been the subject of a 30-year armed struggle and a hard-fought peace agreement. So to gloss over it was not looking at the problem, which was going to block this thing at the end.archived recording (theresa may)The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop.ellen barryBut the way she squared the circle with the Irish border is to create something called the backstop. And what the backstop means is that the entire of the U.K. would remain in the customs union until such a time that there is a solution to the border problem, which could easily be never. And this is why she lost her Brexiteers. Because they said, well, this is just a way for us to stay in the European Union, subject to their regulations, indefinitely, because there is no provision for the United Kingdom leaving the backstop unilaterally. So they just saw themselves as being stuck at the mercy of Europe indefinitely.michael barbaroWow, that’s the first time I understood the backstop. Thank you.archived recording 1The fact is that her deal isn’t really a deal. Because what it actually does is postpone everything. It doesn’t settle anything. It actually guarantees more uncertainty, which is terrible for business. And it’s not even Brexit.archived recording 2It is not Brexit at all. And they’re pretending that it is.ellen barrySo what she begins to do is try to persuade the country to compromise. But it is extremely late in the game. And she hasn’t laid the groundwork for a compromise. Much of her energy went to keeping the hardliners onside. And as soon as she published her withdrawal agreement, she lost them.archived recordingTheresa May still believes there’s a battle to be won in Brussels. A growing number of British M.P.s don’t. The view from Europe is of a nation increasingly at odds with itself.michael barbaroAnd how does may respond to all these condemnations and men who are essentially beating her up?ellen barryThis is such an irritating, maddening group of people that — I don’t know. A lot of Britons, during this period, their heart went out to her. Because any normal person would just throw their hands up and walk away from this nightmare of a job. But she’d just wake up in the morning and dust herself off and set aside her personal feelings and say —archived recording (theresa may)I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.ellen barry— again and again —archived recording (theresa may)From the very beginning, I have known what I wanted to deliver for the British people to honor their vote in the referendum.ellen barry— I have committed to delivering Brexit to the British people.archived recording (theresa may)The British people just want us to get on with it. They are looking to the Conservative Party to deliver — to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole U.K.ellen barryAnd that’s what I’m going to do.archived recording (theresa may)I’m going to do my job of getting the best deal for Britain. I’m going to do my job of getting a deal that is in the national interest.ellen barryShe stuck with it, and she stuck with it. And she seemed unwilling to give up.archived recording (theresa may)And am I going to see this through? Yes.[music]ellen barryUntil last week.michael barbaroWe’ll be right back. So bring us back to this Committee Room number 14. What do we know about what Theresa May said as she offered her own head to members of the Conservative Party as this final gesture?ellen barryThis was the way it was described by George Freeman, who was her former policy adviser. “She, with tears not far from her eyes, said, ‘I promised I would deliver the Brexit agreement.’” She said, “I’ve made many mistakes. I’m only human. I beg you, colleagues, vote for the withdrawal agreement. And I will go.” He said there was silence in the room. And it was incredibly sad.[music]ellen barryAfter she finished speaking in this committee room, there were several M.P.s who were hardline, holdout Brexiteers who got up and said, publicly, that they were now going to back her deal.michael barbaroWow, so this seems to be working?ellen barryYes. For the next 45 minutes to an hour, journalists were on Twitter just counting the number of Brexiteers that were changing sides. And you had people like Boris Johnson, who — I think he had compared her deal to a suicide vest at one point. This is what he said to The Daily Telegraph: “I feel very, very sorry. And though it fills me with pain, I’m going to have to support this thing.” So he flipped sides. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Brexiteer bannerman, tweeted out that “half a loaf is better than no bread.” In other words, he was willing to give up some of his Brexiteer credibility to get behind Theresa May and give her his vote. And you just began to see this happening again and again. They were flipping. And I think it got up to something like 30 or 40 people were indicating that they were changing sides. And it looked, somehow, that at this last moment, in this last Hail Mary pass that she had thrown by offering her resignation, she might have just gotten it over the line.archived recording (john bercow)Order. Order.ellen barryBut sometime after 3 o’clock on Friday, March 29 —archived recording (john bercow)The ayes to the right, 286. The noes to the left, 344. So the noes have it. The noes have it.ellen barryParliament rejected her withdrawal agreement for the third time by a vote of 344 to 286.michael barbaroSo she just fell short?ellen barryYeah, she fell short.archived recording (john bercow)Point of order. The prime minister.archived recording (theresa may)Point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I think it should be a matter of profound regret to every member of this House that, once again, we have been unable to support leaving the European Union in orderly fashion. The implications of the House’s decision are grave.michael barbaroSo this offer to give up her own prime ministership in exchange for Brexit — essentially, Parliament said to her, not even that is enough.ellen barryIt wasn’t enough.archived recordingGood evening from Westminster. If the prime minister had had her way, the United Kingdom would be leaving the E.U. in one hour’s time. Today should have been Brexit Day. That’s what Theresa May had promised. But instead, she —ellen barryAnd this is the absurd trap that we’ve all been in — that here is an impossible task that doesn’t get done and doesn’t get done. And yet nothing changes. There’s no off-ramp. And so Brexit still isn’t done. And Theresa May’s still the person in charge of it. You imagine that she was ready to walk away. And you could see it on her face. She looked like a different person. She looked younger. She looked — I don’t know. She just didn’t look strained anymore. But actually, she’s not free. It’s not done. And she’s going to have to start all over again, in the morning.michael barbaroEllen, thank you very much. We appreciate it.ellen barryThank you.[music]michael barbaroHere’s what else you need to know, today.archived recording (donald trump)I’ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.michael barbaroOver the weekend, the Trump Administration said it would drastically cut financial aid to three Central American countries in retaliation for what he said was their failure to stop the flow of migrants to the U.S. border.archived recording (donald trump)We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we’re not paying them anymore. Because they haven’t done a thing for us.michael barbaroThe $500 million in aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras was originally designed to address the root cause of migration — violence, lack of jobs and poverty. And its elimination could ultimately backfire, triggering even more migration to the U.S. And New York will become the first city in the country to charge drivers for using its streets, in an attempt to reduce congestion and raise money to repair its subway system.archived recording (andrew cuomo)You have to get fewer cars driving into Manhattan. The traffic is so bad. I can’t tell you how many days, myself, I just get out of the car and walk. Because it’s so much faster.michael barbaroUnder a plan adopted by Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature on Sunday, drivers will be charged a fee of at least $10 to drive below 60th Street in Manhattan.archived recording (andrew cuomo)Buses in Manhattan, I think the average is now down to, like, four miles per hour.michael barbaroThe fees, known as congestion pricing, are already in use in London, Stockholm and Singapore, where they have cut both traffic and air pollution. In New York, they are expected to raise $1 billion a year for the city’s subway system.archived recording (andrew cuomo)And it’s a little bit of a chicken and an egg. You need a viable, functioning mass transit system so people get out of their cars and feel comfortable taking the mass transit system. And that’s the point behind congestion pricing.[music]michael barbaroThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise. No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful.It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.“I don’t think the central institutions of government have been discredited like this in the postwar period,” said William Davies, who teaches political economy at Goldsmiths, University of London.ImageHundreds of thousands of people marched in London last weekend in support of a second referendum.CreditDan Kitwood/Getty Images“There’s a fin-de-siècle sense that modern British politics has run out of road,” said Mr. Davies, author of “Nervous States: Democracy and the Decline of Reason.” “Maybe the best thing to come out of this is the recognition that the political elites — people just want them to get off the stage. I don’t know who they want to replace them. But there’s a sense that a reboot would be something people would be in favor of.”It was barely seven summers ago that Britain presented itself to the world as a confident, outward-looking, post-imperial country. The opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics — featuring a flock of sheep, a snippet of the Sex Pistols’ music and a skit about a skydiving Queen Elizabeth — suggested a country unburdened by longing for its more orderly, homogeneous past.It’s hard to conceive of that now. The referendum question has divided Britain into warring tribes, unable to settle on any shared vision of the future. An ancient, robust democracy is groaning under the weight of conflicting demands — on the executive, to carry out the will of the people; and on the members of Parliament, to follow their conscience and to act in what they believe to be the people’s interest.In such a situation, the country might have united in its resentment of the European Union, which had vowed to make Britain’s withdrawal painful. But that has not happened. Britons are blaming their own leaders.“I think people have totally lost confidence in democracy, in British democracy and the way it’s run,” said Tommy Turner, 32, a firefighter. He was perched on a stool at the Hare & Hounds, a working-class pub in Surrey, where nearly everyone voted to leave the European Union. Among his friends, he said, he sensed a profound sense of betrayal that Britain was not exiting on March 29, as promised.“You’ve got egotistical people in politics, and they want to follow their own agenda,” he said. “They don’t want to follow what the people have voted for.” Asked how he felt about the approaching Brexit deadline, Mr. Turner said, “worried.”“We’re in the last hour,” he said. “I’m wondering: What does more damage? Leaving without a deal? Or the total annihilation of faith in democracy?”Polling has borne out his worry. Britons’ assessment of their leaders is scathing, with 81 percent saying that Britain has handled Brexit badly, and 7 percent saying it has handled it well, according to data released recently by NatCen Social Research, an independent agency. (Two years ago, the numbers were 41 percent negative and 29 percent positive.)Particularly drastic, researchers said, is the souring of Leave voters in the past six months, as Mrs. May concluded her negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and shared the terms of departure with the country. Expectations that Brexit would have concrete effects — by lifting the economy or slowing immigration — have diminished sharply, the data show.ImageCreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesNeil Bligh, 45, who sat by Mr. Turner at the Hare & Hounds, could dimly recall the buzz of triumph he felt in 2016, when he discovered that his side had won. But that feeling has long since dissipated, replaced by a gathering sense of gloom and mistrust as the promised reward of a free-trading Britain recedes further and further.“Now, it’s like an ache,” he said. “That’s the best way to describe Brexit, as the remnant of a hangover. It’s just always there. A lot of people, if they could go back and make it all not happen, they would.”The bartender, Chauntelle Hartley, known by her clientele as “Squid,” said the process was so maddening that she could no longer focus on it for long periods.“It was on the telly earlier, and I watched ‘Friends’ on my phone,” she said. “I want to listen to it; I realized that it was on. But I think I only made it 40 seconds.”Views on Brexit were almost diametrically opposed at The Highbury Barn, a pub in North London that offers haddock from the fishmonger across the street and provides pans of water for visiting dogs. In this neighborhood, Islington North, in the constituency of the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the number of signatories on a petition asking the government to revoke Article 50, the part of the European Union treaty that lays out the terms of Britain’s exit, reached one-quarter of the population.But people here took an equally dismal view of the government’s performance.Aidan Hughes, 58, who works in finance, was waiting for a cab in the back of the bar.“What we’re seeing is that the process the government’s involved in has been effectively hijacked by an even smaller segment of the ruling government, the right-wing element of the party,” he said. He blamed the first-past-the-post voting system, which tends to increase polarization between two large parties and exaggerate geographical divides, setting up stark conflict between sections of society.He said it was time for Britain to move toward a system of proportional representation, common to democracies that evolved later than Britain’s, which allows smaller parties to enter Parliament more easily.“We would then have people with different views coming together to compromise, to find a way forward,” he said. “Whereas whoever wins an election now can currently push their views, irrespective of support.”ImageCreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesGeoff Peddie, 46, a high-school English teacher, was waiting for a friend as the evening wore on and the pub quieted down. He was angry that such a slim majority had triggered a national act of this magnitude and permanence.“I don’t feel that I’ve been listened to, or that nearly half the population have been listened to,” he said. “The majority has essentially been pandering to the worst elements in our society.”A sense of impotence and paralysis now colors Britain’s image abroad. This was given visual form recently when a Bulgarian diplomat posted a photo on Twitter of senior European officials in a cluster as they conferred in a corridor. No Briton was present.“Britain is forced out of the room while other countries make decisions about its future,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute.As Mrs. May stalled for time, keeping her plans tightly hidden from the public, Brexit sucked so much oxygen from the government that it left no time for anything else.“There is a parochialization as Britain loses ambition in anything bigger than itself; it’s a shrinking of horizons and a self-obsession,” he said.He compared it to the Suez crisis, the Egyptian nationalist uprising that signaled the end of the British and French empires.“The thing has been humiliating; there is a sense of no one being in the cockpit,” Mr. Leonard added. “Britain was a different country after Suez, and that’s where we are now. I don’t think there is any way back if we go ahead with Brexit.”In a landscape of pervasive gloom, Mr. Hughes, the finance worker, did see one reason for hope: That Britons, young and old, were passionately engaged, as never before, in the inner workings of their own government. Even if it was because they were so angry.“This is starting to drag people into an interest in what’s actually happening,” he said. “Clearly it’s a total mess and it’s been handled appallingly by the government. Be that as it may, at least it’s gotten people animated in talking about these topics.”Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Or maybe we just played ourselves.By Bret StephensOpinion ColumnistMarch 28, 2019ImagePresident Trump speaking to the media after a summary of the Mueller report’s findings was released.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesMaybe we’ve had this all wrong.Maybe Donald Trump isn’t just some two-bit con artist who lucked his way into the White House thanks to an overconfident opponent. Or a second-rate demagogue with a rat-like instinct for arousing his base’s baser emotions and his enemies’ knee-jerk reactions. Or a dimwit mistaken for an oracle, like some malignant version of Chauncey Gardiner from “Being There.”Thanks to Robert Mueller, we know he isn’t Russia’s man inside, awaiting coded instruction from his handler in the Kremlin.Maybe, in fact, Trump is the genius he claims to be, possessed — as he likes to boast — of a “very good brain.”O.K., I don’t quite believe that. But going forward, it would be wise for all of his inveterate critics in the news media, including me, to treat it as our operating assumption. The alternative is to let him hand us our butts all over again, just as he did by winning the G.O.P. nomination and then the election, and then by presiding over years of robust economic growth.That should be the central lesson from the epic media fiasco of Russiagate.Let’s specify what the fiasco is not. It’s not that there was nothing for Mueller to investigate. It’s not that he uncovered no wrongdoing. It’s not that the president did not act in suspicious ways, epitomized by his appalling performance at Helsinki. It’s not that he didn’t lie and mislead, not least about his business ties in Russia. It’s not that the Trump campaign wasn’t studded with people who were, at a minimum, profoundly vulnerable to Russian blackmail. It’s not that the Kremlin didn’t actively seek to interfere in the election, with a favorable eye toward Trump’s candidacy. Pace the president and his sycophants — the ones who spent nearly two years casting aspersions on Mueller’s integrity, only to now hail his conclusions as dispositive — the nature and extent of Trump’s ties to Russia required a thorough investigation. It got done. Barring some major discrepancy between the attorney general’s summary of Mueller’s report and the report itself, it’s time to say: Case closed. Thank God the president is not a Russian stooge.The fiasco was to assume that the result of Mueller’s investigation was a foregone conclusion. And to believe that the existence of dots was enough to prove that they had to connect. And to report on it nonstop, breathlessly, as if the levee would break any second. And to turn Adam Schiff into a celebrity guest. And to belittle or exclude contrarian voices.Last July, I wrote of the special counsel’s inquiry: “The smart play is to defend the integrity of Mueller’s investigation and invest as little political capital as possible in predicting the result. If Mueller discovers a crime, that’s a gift to the president’s opponents. If he discovers nothing, it shouldn’t become a humiliating liability.” Instead, as Matt Taibbi perceptively observed last week, what we have is a W.M.D.-size self-inflicted media disaster, which ought to require some extensive self-criticism before we breathlessly move on to Trump’s latest alleged idiocy. Assume for a moment that Trump’s odd Russia behavior, including the obsequiousness toward Vladimir Putin and the routine eruptions against Mueller, was merely a way of baiting journalists for years.If so, he could hardly have played us better: He’d be the Keyser Söze of media manipulation. To adapt a line, perhaps the greatest trick Trump ever pulled was to convince the world his brain didn’t exist.There’s a simpler, opposite explanation: Trump was never sophisticated enough to have been involved in some high-flown conspiracy with Russia. It would have required too much guile. Forget Söze; think Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The difference between suspicious and shambolic behavior often depends on who is doing the watching. Where some see chaos, others detect patterns. From a certain distance, they can be hard to tell apart.For years I’ve bounced between these two interpretations of the president — at times astonished by his incompetence; at other times amazed by his cunning. There’s much about the world that Trump will never understand. What he knows, however, is that success is above all a matter of being seen (regardless of results); that the more one lies, the less people notice; that winning is a matter of playing by one’s own rules (and changing them as needed); that, while hope may be inspiring, rage is intoxicating.These ideas may be noxious, but they are also the fundamental political insights of our time.Whichever view one takes, Donald Trump has just won a major victory over his chosen political enemies, including this newspaper. Whether he’s achieved this through genius or luck, it would behoove us not to take him for a fool. This was the week to examine our own foolishness instead.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Russians Always Knew There Was No CollusionAdvertisementOpinionSupported byRussians Always Knew There Was No CollusionThe Kremlin’s allies and its opponents alike have been baffled by America’s Russia obsession. Can we ever look at the U.S. the same way again?By Alexey KovalevMr. Kovalev is a Russian journalist.March 29, 2019ImageA store across from the United States Embassy in Moscow offered a discount in honor of Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017. Perceptions of the United States have changed in the last two years.CreditCreditVladimir Gerdo\TASS, via Getty ImagesMOSCOW — Russians weren’t waiting for Robert Mueller’s report with quite the same excitement as Americans.Russian state media’s coverage of Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency has vacillated between breathless adoration, mockery and outrage, but one thing has been consistent: The idea of Russia electing and controlling an American president has always been deemed absurd. Most references to the Mueller inquiry and the Trump-Russia story in state media are preceded by a qualifier: “the so-called Russia investigation,” as the prominent TV host Dmitry Kiselyov puts it.It’s not just the state media that has rejected the idea that Mr. Trump colluded with Russia. Even liberals and opponents of President Vladimir Putin have been deeply skeptical, pointing out that Russia’s ruling circles are barely competent enough to prop themselves up, let alone manipulate a superpower.When the news broke last week that Mr. Mueller had finished his report, Moscow’s political and media circles reacted with a mixture of contempt and derision. Far from being a top news story, it was practically forgotten after a few angry comments from state officials. Coverage focused far more on the coming election in Ukraine.Alexey Pushkov, a former diplomat and a political analyst, tweeted to his 360,000 followers on Tuesday, following the release of Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the report: “The results of Mueller’s investigations are a disgrace to the U.S. and their political elite. It’s now confirmed that all their allegations have been plucked out of thin air. The media have played a shameful role of lie-mongers in a campaign built on lies. The adherents of this conspiracy theory are discredited. Only an idiot can believe them now.”To the Kremlin and its supporters, Russia is the aggrieved party here, and the government’s consistent denials of interfering in America’s internal affairs have been fully vindicated. Appearing on the Russian talk show “60 Minutes,” Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said the ministry was preparing a report to name and shame the “brigade of propagandists” — pointing at, among others, Fareed Zakaria — who tried to tie Mr. Trump to Russia. She added that “apologies are expected.”These commentaries conveniently focused on the portions of Mr. Barr’s summary of the report that ruled out the Trump team’s coordination with Russian operatives, and they disregarded the fact that the full report has not been released. Other important portions of the report, which reached the unequivocal conclusion — also supported by independent investigations, including in Russian media — that there were, indeed, Russian efforts to influence the 2016 American election, went completely ignored.But while government officials and state media tell one-sided stories and revel in “I-told-you-sos,” liberal Russians like myself and many of the people I know are less joyous. Online and in private conversations, it becomes clear that whatever the outcome of the Mueller investigation, our relationship with America has changed.We’ve seen anti-Russian xenophobia spread into the American mainstream. Etched in our minds are comments like the one James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, made in an interview when he said that Russians are “almost genetically driven to co-opt, penetrate, gain favor, whatever.”This climate hasn’t just offended us; it’s making our ability to communicate and share experiences with Americans more difficult. Take the example of Leonid Volkov, an opposition political operative who went to the United States last year as part of the Yale World Fellows program. In a blog post he wrote while there, he described his frustration while trying to monitor the midterm elections to gain insight for his own campaigns in Russia. The very idea of a Russian volunteering for an American political campaign is today so toxic, Mr. Volkov wrote, that he had to abandon his plan.In the atmosphere where “contacts with Russians” has become cause for suspicion, every bank transaction and visa application faces extra scrutiny. I’ve heard from people I know about how exchange programs, conferences and businesses are suffering. To those of us who paid attention to American media and politics over the past two years, it quickly became clear that too many in the United States know nothing about our country. Ominous images of onion-shaped domes taking over the White House baffled us; St. Basil’s Cathedral is not part of the Kremlin complex and has no political connotation. The ubiquity of hammers and sickles in visuals accompanying Trump-Russia reports seemed likewise absurd. Our country hasn’t been Communist for about 30 years.We have few illusions about our own government, its dirty dealings abroad or our own toxic media. But we expected better of America.Oleg Kashin, a prominent Russian journalist, wrote in a 2017 op-ed essay that “every time a Russian television network or pro-Kremlin newspaper reaches a new low, it was once commonplace among independent thinkers to say that the Western media giants never allowed themselves such mistakes.” That’s much harder to do now.The end of the Mueller investigation and the conclusion that the Trump campaign didn’t collude with Russia may allow Washington and Moscow to begin to try to fix diplomatic and business relations. I’d be glad to see that. But my perception of the United States’ politics and media might have suffered irreparable damage as a result of #Russiagate, and I’m afraid that’s the case for many people like me. Robert Mueller can’t fix that.RelatedHow Powerful Is Vladimir Putin Really?March 23, 2019Opinion | Max FrankelThe Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro QuoMarch 27, 2019Alexey Kovalev (@alexey__kovalev) is the investigations editor at Meduza, an independent Russian news outlet.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|It’s the Day After April Fools’ DayAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe conversationIt’s the Day After April Fools’ DaySeems like a good time to talk about politics.By Gail Collins and Bret StephensMs. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.April 2, 2019ImageA mix of messages at a Trump rally last week in Grand Rapids, Mich.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesGail Collins: Happy April, Bret! Since we’re past Fools’ Day, I will avoid any wisecracks about Donald Trump.Where are you on the Mueller report? Ready to consign it to the dustbin of history? Demanding to see the full document? I have to admit I’m sort of ready to give up and move on. Although you could definitely talk me back into the fold.Bret Stephens: Four thoughts, Gail.First: Thank God the president of the United States, whatever else we may think of him, did not collude with Russia to get himself elected. I’d rather have a scoundrel in the White House than a traitor.Gail: You’re setting the bar pretty low there, but you’re still right.Bret: Second: Thank God we have a report at all — which, considering the vindication it brings Trump (and the vindictiveness it brings out of him) — would not have happened if the Trumpists had gotten their way and Mueller had been fired. All of those conservatives who impugned Mueller’s integrity and his team’s impartiality owe them a giant apology.Gail: Not holding my breath waiting. Go on.Bret: Third: Thank God for Mueller himself. He didn’t pontificate on the Sunday talk shows the way Jim Comey or Adam Schiff did. He didn’t pull any punches when it came to prosecuting the likes of Paul Manafort. He ran a tight ship. He demonstrated that even in Washington there is no substitute for character, professionalism and reputation. That’s why I suspect that when the full document is released, we’ll be able to treat it as the last word on the subject.Finally: The news media, especially cable news, needs to do some major soul-searching. Too many reporters and pundits got way out ahead of their skis, creating a collusion narrative out of a series of unconnected dots. When historians examine why public confidence in journalism fell to such lows in our era, episodes like Russiagate will be a major part of the story.Gail: You didn’t have to believe Trump was actively engaged in a conspiracy to point out a whole lot of unnerving stuff going on. For instance, there’s still a terrible potential for Russian sabotage via internet that this administration isn’t taking seriously.Bret: For sure. There was a lot of smoke. There were plenty of dots. The investigation was warranted. The president repeatedly behaved in ways that suggested guilt, from lying about his business ties to Russia to seizing his translator’s notes after a conversation with Vladimir Putin to his cavalier attitude about Russia’s intentions.The media was right to report all this and raise questions. But there was also a lack of skepticism about some of the evidence, and a tone of certitude about where that evidence was bound to lead.Gail: I’ll give you the whole impeachment thing. That was perhaps over the top. But we’re still waiting to hear the results of investigations into Trump — mainly his business practices — that are still going on here in New York.Bret: I agree in the sense that I think his behavior as “Individual No. 1” in the payoffs to former paramours are felony violations of campaign-finance laws. But I’m also becoming increasingly convinced that the endless investigations into Trump’s past business practices are going to wind up doing more harm to Trump’s opponents than they do to him. It makes him look like the victim of an endless inquest into his pre-presidential behavior. And it distracts Democrats from talking about the things that Americans actually want from politicians, like better schools and a growing economy.Gail: Glad you brought that up! I’m way more interested in the attack on Obamacare than his unappetizing history in real estate.What’s your opinion on where to go with health care? I will start by acknowledging Obamacare is sort of a mess. It began as a mess because certain senators (cough, mutter, Joe Lieberman) were too deeply in the thrall of the insurance companies to let a sane restructuring occur.Bret: Music to my ears, Gail. Obamacare is a mess, even if most Americans have learned to live with it (as we do with other messes). If it weren’t a mess, Democrats wouldn’t keep talking about “Medicare for all” as the next evolution in health care policy.I think that’s a huge mistake, both as a matter of policy and politics. It requires another major reorganization of a huge part of the U.S. economy. Take Bernie Sanders’s plan, for example: It’s going to cost a bundle — an estimated $32.6 trillion over 10 years — and the taxes to fund it will have to come from middle-class Americans. It will mean a declining quality of health care. And it will lead to a two-tier system in which wealthy Americans go “off grid” to get high-quality medical attention while the rest of the country is stuck in a system that will resemble the V.A.Trump will also be merciless about this, politically, claiming that this is just the sort of socialism he warned about in his State of the Union speech. And it will frighten a great many voters, including those all-important suburban women, who might despise the president for all kinds of reasons but fear the Democrats are veering toward the Bernie Sanders left.Gail: All the Democratic presidential candidates are not talking about Medicare for all. Some of the ones who did are trying to backpedal, not really having thought about what it meant before they went there. Three-fifths of the adult population from 19 to 64 get their health insurance from employers, and a lot of them like it. They’re going to get very nervous if they think they might have to give it up.But we need sweeping change. Our current health care system is wildly expensive because it’s structured in a crazy way that creates piles and piles of stupendously expensive paperwork. We could create a government-run public policy option that would give people the security of Obamacare without the crazy structure. And gradually, if the option was attractive enough, employers might want to get in on it, too.Bret: I definitely agree about the paperwork problem. My own views about health care are pretty libertarian. We need radical price transparency so that people are aware of the huge disparities in price between say, a blood test from Clinic A versus Clinic B. We need tort reform so that doctors don’t live in mortal fear of being sued by patients. We need more than just gold, silver and bronze insurance options: Healthy young people should also be able to buy cut-rate plans that cover only catastrophes. As for Medicare, the long-term goal should be to get rid of it. That’s obviously distinct from Medicaid: Even crazy right-wingers like me believe that government has a moral duty to ensure that poor people have good access to quality medical care from womb to tomb.Gail: Doctors do have to pay heavy insurance premiums to protect themselves from lawsuits. But patients also have to be protected from careless or inept physicians. It’s tough to find a perfect solution — people have been trying for years. But fine by me if you want to work on it, Bret. I’ll be cheering from the galleries.Bret: The deeper problem with all of these health care debates is that we’re discussing something that inevitably generates bad outcomes even under the best of circumstances. But can we switch subjects from tragedy to farce? I’m curious to know your take on the Jussie Smollett story, which is what everyone I know was talking about last week (when they weren’t talking about Mueller).Gail: You do have to thank the guy for taking Donald Trump off our minds. Not every day do you have a TV star making up a story of being attacked by MAGA hat-wearing racist thugs. Everybody was stunned when the prosecutor dropped all the charges. She basically said, well, this is what we always do with first offenders who don’t pose a threat to the community.Not sure that would be true of first offenders whose self-promoting lies and evasions cost the city six figures in overtime. But it’s a good reminder that we have different criminal justice systems for the poor and the nonpoor.Bret: I would not have minded if Smollett had gotten off relatively lightly — provided, that is, that he had admitted the charges, shown contrition and begged forgiveness. It’s the arrogance and gall that bothers me. Kim Foxx, the Chicago prosecutor, says her office would have had a hard time securing a conviction. Was Smollett’s check to the perpetrators and their confession of the crime not enough? The whole thing reeks of a corrupt bargain, and I hope the Department of Justice gets involved. Even Chicago can’t afford Chicago-style politics.By the way, I don’t want us to wrap up the conversation without complimenting you on your marvelous column about statues, specifically their scandalous dearth when it comes to honoring women. I’m thrilled Billie Holiday will be getting one soon, in Queens. There are many more worthy would-be honorees that I can think of. Gerty Cori was the first American woman to win a Nobel in science. Zora Neale Hurston ought to have one, too, if she doesn’t already. And Dorothy Parker, provided the statue itself had a ribald sense of humor.Who else should we be honoring?Gail: Thanks, Bret. Right now, only five of the 150 public statues in New York are of women — we’ve got dozens of ethically compromised politicians and run-of-the-mill generals but we’re only now working on Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.Once we’ve gotten the public figures taken care of, it’d be nice to celebrate some low-profile heroines. I was just reading about Esther Lewis, a widow who had a farm in Pennsylvania in the pre-Civil War era. She ran a stop on the Underground Railroad that sheltered runaway slaves, discovered iron ore on her property and created a serious mining operation, educated her four daughters and churned nearly 300 pounds of butter a year.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Trump’s Acts Show the Urgent Need to Curb the Imperial PresidencyAdvertisementOpinionSupported byTrump’s Acts Show the Urgent Need to Curb the Imperial Presidency The end of the Mueller investigation reveals that post-Watergate guardrails set up against executive overreach have been smashed and need replacing.By Ian Bassin and Justin FlorenceMr. Bassin and Mr. Florence served as associate White House counsels.April 1, 2019ImageCreditCreditAl Drago for The New York TimesIn the post-Watergate era, most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F.B.I. director investigating him, or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president’s personal interests. Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony? Unheard of.Whatever one’s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation, the Barr letter makes one thing clear: The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed. We still need to see the full Mueller report, but unless corrective steps are taken, Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr will have changed, perhaps profoundly, the shape of presidential power, and in troubling ways.It’s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement.They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary. Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution. On the contrary, such legislation would help enforce it.First, Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions, giving teeth to the norms of the post-Watergate era. One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon’s abuse of the I.R.S. to target enemies. Congress made it unlawful for certain officials, including the president, to “request, directly or indirectly,” any I.R.S. officer or employee to, in effect, weaponize a taxpayer audit. Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings — or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so. Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar, for example, on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN’s coverage, or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents.Second, Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests, legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation (once it’s concluded). This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior. Representative Adam Schiff’s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start; it could be supplemented to apply to so-called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president.Third, Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public. A little-known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people. Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false “determinations” and “findings.” Finally, Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign. Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual, but that merely compiles prudential guidelines. Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies (such as the Department of Homeland Security). It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season. An even stronger measure could require early-stage confidential judicial approval before a law-enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken. Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power — such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign, using the security clearance process to silence critics, sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events.Campaign season shouldn’t bring government to a halt, and law enforcement shouldn’t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context. But given the abuses we’ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future, we ignore additional protections at our peril.Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support. Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president’s conduct.The Constitution commands that the president “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” At its core, this commands the president to act in good faith. The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice: in the “take care” clause and the president’s oath.As the founders understood, the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest. If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests, as the Barr letter does, we may find that our democratic experiment won’t extend much longer.Ian Bassin (@ianbassin) and Justin Florence (@justingflorence) are co-founders of the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy.

Kelly.CreditAlyssa Schukar for The New York Times[Want to get this by email? Here’s the sign-up.]On any given day, dozens of Times reporters venture into the world, conduct an interview for a story and record it — on their iPhone, a digital voice recorder or an old-fashioned tape recorder.They record it, above all, for fact-checking purposes, to ensure that every word they quote from an interview is accurate.But the fate of those recordings, after a story is published, is usually tragic: They sit unheard, as nameless files, waiting to be deleted with a swipe of the thumb.Then came “The Daily.” From the moment we created the show, we knew these recordings would be a treasure trove. An army of colleagues was already creating hours of memorable and exclusive audio. We just needed them to send it to us.And they did. In April 2017, two months after “The Daily” was launched, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush interviewed a recently inaugurated President Trump in the Oval Office.The “Daily” producers working on the episode — Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills and Lisa Tobin — learned about the meeting only an hour beforehand.We knew Maggie and Glenn would record the interview. That was a given. So we emailed an urgent request: Please make sure the recorders are as close to the president as humanly possible. (We wanted high-quality audio, after all.) They complied, and early that afternoon, a 26-minute audio file arrived in our inbox.The result was a breakthrough episode in which listeners could hear our reporters peppering the president with questions and fact-checking his false claims in real time.That show created a model for us. We would build episodes around an original interview, conducted by a Times reporter, and combine it with a second interview — me interviewing the reporters who had conducted the original interview. An interview about an interview. Kind of meta, right?It solved a number of problems. Original interviews contain many compelling moments you’d want to hear, but require a lot of context to understand. Who better to provide that context than the reporters who did the interview?That’s what you heard when I spoke with John Eligon, a national correspondent based in Kansas City. He interviewed the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, about her closely watched prosecution of the musician R. Kelly, sent the recording to producers Jessica Cheung and Annie Brown, and then sat for an interview about the interview. Listen here.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.Live from the iPhone of Mike SchmidtAhead of Monday’s episode, we asked Mike Schmidt to document his Sunday through iPhone voice memos as he and his colleagues in the Washington bureau — Elisabeth Bumiller, Mark Landler, Nick Fandos and others — awaited the attorney general’s summary of the Mueller report. Listen to his audio diary from the afternoon, up until the moment when the news dropped:From ‘The Daily’: The Mike Schmidt TapesListen to Mike Schmidt and his colleagues in the Washington bureau as they await the attorney general’s summary of the Mueller report.The key to making “The Daily”: packing tapeImageA peek inside the studio of David Halbfinger — journalist, violinist and MacGyver. CreditDavid Halbfinger/The New York TimesProducer Clare Toeniskoetter on how she gets sound from reporters who are many thousands of miles away:“When we interview foreign correspondents, it’s always a challenge to figure out how to record their end of the conversation. For our episode about Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, I reached out to Jerusalem bureau chief David Halbfinger, who told me he already had his own high-quality microphone (something that producers love to hear), but had no way of holding it steady during our interview. That’s where a music stand and some packing tape came in. Plus, we found out David’s secret talent — he’s a violinist!”On “The Daily” this weekCoordination: not established. Obstruction: more complicated. We talk to Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt about how the attorney general summarized the Mueller report. The special counsel was supposed to decide whether Trump committed a crime, but the attorney general did so instead. “I’m starting to think that the special counsel regulations, the way that this investigation was set up, has failed,” Mike Schmidt told us. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces indictment on charges of bribery and fraud. And yet so many are ready to re-elect him. David Halbfinger explains why.Kim Foxx, the prosecutor who took the unusual step of asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward, says she knows how difficult it can be to speak out about sexual abuse.“Atta was an angel. Honestly, not because he was my husband.

Kelly.CreditAlyssa Schukar for The New York Times[Want to get this by email? Here’s the sign-up.]On any given day, dozens of Times reporters venture into the world, conduct an interview for a story and record it — on their iPhone, a digital voice recorder or an old-fashioned tape recorder.They record it, above all, for fact-checking purposes, to ensure that every word they quote from an interview is accurate.But the fate of those recordings, after a story is published, is usually tragic: They sit unheard, as nameless files, waiting to be deleted with a swipe of the thumb.Then came “The Daily.” From the moment we created the show, we knew these recordings would be a treasure trove. An army of colleagues was already creating hours of memorable and exclusive audio. We just needed them to send it to us.And they did. In April 2017, two months after “The Daily” was launched, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush interviewed a recently inaugurated President Trump in the Oval Office.The “Daily” producers working on the episode — Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills and Lisa Tobin — learned about the meeting only an hour beforehand.We knew Maggie and Glenn would record the interview. That was a given. So we emailed an urgent request: Please make sure the recorders are as close to the president as humanly possible. (We wanted high-quality audio, after all.) They complied, and early that afternoon, a 26-minute audio file arrived in our inbox.The result was a breakthrough episode in which listeners could hear our reporters peppering the president with questions and fact-checking his false claims in real time.That show created a model for us. We would build episodes around an original interview, conducted by a Times reporter, and combine it with a second interview — me interviewing the reporters who had conducted the original interview. An interview about an interview. Kind of meta, right?It solved a number of problems. Original interviews contain many compelling moments you’d want to hear, but require a lot of context to understand. Who better to provide that context than the reporters who did the interview?That’s what you heard when I spoke with John Eligon, a national correspondent based in Kansas City. He interviewed the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, about her closely watched prosecution of the musician R. Kelly, sent the recording to producers Jessica Cheung and Annie Brown, and then sat for an interview about the interview. Listen here.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.Live from the iPhone of Mike SchmidtAhead of Monday’s episode, we asked Mike Schmidt to document his Sunday through iPhone voice memos as he and his colleagues in the Washington bureau — Elisabeth Bumiller, Mark Landler, Nick Fandos and others — awaited the attorney general’s summary of the Mueller report. Listen to his audio diary from the afternoon, up until the moment when the news dropped:From ‘The Daily’: The Mike Schmidt TapesListen to Mike Schmidt and his colleagues in the Washington bureau as they await the attorney general’s summary of the Mueller report.The key to making “The Daily”: packing tapeImageA peek inside the studio of David Halbfinger — journalist, violinist and MacGyver. CreditDavid Halbfinger/The New York TimesProducer Clare Toeniskoetter on how she gets sound from reporters who are many thousands of miles away:“When we interview foreign correspondents, it’s always a challenge to figure out how to record their end of the conversation. For our episode about Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, I reached out to Jerusalem bureau chief David Halbfinger, who told me he already had his own high-quality microphone (something that producers love to hear), but had no way of holding it steady during our interview. That’s where a music stand and some packing tape came in. Plus, we found out David’s secret talent — he’s a violinist!”On “The Daily” this weekCoordination: not established. Obstruction: more complicated. We talk to Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt about how the attorney general summarized the Mueller report. The special counsel was supposed to decide whether Trump committed a crime, but the attorney general did so instead. “I’m starting to think that the special counsel regulations, the way that this investigation was set up, has failed,” Mike Schmidt told us. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces indictment on charges of bribery and fraud. And yet so many are ready to re-elect him. David Halbfinger explains why.Kim Foxx, the prosecutor who took the unusual step of asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward, says she knows how difficult it can be to speak out about sexual abuse.“Atta was an angel. Honestly, not because he was my husband. He was too good to be true.” A family in New Zealand says goodbye to a loved one they lost in the attack at Al Noor Mosque.For the biggest stories of our time, told by New York Times journalists each weekday, listen to “The Daily.” You can find it at nytimes.com/thedaily or wherever you get your podcasts.Have thoughts about the show?

The committee vote was 24-17 along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Trump's fellow Republicans opposed.Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, issued a four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election.Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods.In addition to Bannon, the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.They are among 81 people, agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates.Nadler's panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline. Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign.Nadler said he would work with Barr "for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials" and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material."But if that doesn't work out in a very short order, we will issue the subpoenas," Nadler added. "... The committee must see everything." The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government's third branch - the judiciary.Representative Doug Collins, the committee's top Republican, said Democrats are "desperate for dirt on this president.""This is reckless. It's irresponsible. And it's disingenuous," Collins said. "It's also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing: making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy."It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents. It could ignore a subpoena, running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress, and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle.INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Trump critic Adam Schiff, is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump's inaugural committee.Citing people familiar with the request, the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than $100 million. The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters.Barr's March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller's "principal conclusions" said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Moscow denied election interference. Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report."If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge - not the president or his political appointee - to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record," Nadler said. Trump ally Lindsey Graham, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that the House panel's demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was "dangerous and ridiculous."The Justice Department declined comment. Priebus declined to comment. A lawyer for Priebus, Bannon and McGahn, as well as a Bannon spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries. Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge's permission to get access to Mueller's grand jury material, which is protected under federal law. Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far. Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well, noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report's release to Congress.

The New York Times and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize, awarded by Columbia in 2018, for their reporting on the issue, a prize Trump says should be taken away.Complicating the issue is the broad definition of the news media circa 2019, encompassing everything from painstakingly sourced investigative stories to overheated tweets to opinionated pundits."It's premature to pronounce this coverage as some kind of epic press failure," said Nancy Gibbs, former Time magazine editor and a Harvard University professor of press, politics and public policy. People angered by the press' role in investigating the president will use Mueller's findings as a lever in any way they can, she said."That doesn't mean that they're right," Gibbs said.The phrase "so wrong for so long" was used by White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney during a CNN appearance on Sunday. He said "we need to figure out" what happened with reporting on the story. Sean Davis, co-founder of the Federalist online magazine, said the same thing in the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier in the week that argued "America's blue-chip journalists botched the entire story." The president retweeted his story."I'm not sure what you're saying the media got wrong," replied CNN's Jake Tapper. "The media reported the investigation was ongoing. Other than the people in the media on the left, not on this network, I don't know anybody who got anything wrong. We didn't say there was conspiracy. We said that Mueller was investigating conspiracy."Mulvaney, without offering specifics, said to Tapper that "if that's your recollection of history, that's great."Face it, the media got this wrong," he said. "It's OK, people get stuff wrong all the time. Just not at this level."There were obviously disputed individual stories along the way. ABC suspended Brian Ross for a story wrongly alleging that Trump had asked former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss foreign policy with the Russians before he was elected. Three CNN journalists resigned over a story falsely linking a Trump aide to a Russian investment fund. The special counsel's office denied a Buzzfeed report that it had evidence Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress over a Moscow office project.Yet much of what the public learned over the past two years on the story was the result of relentless digging by reporters.In tweets over the past week, Trump repeated his contention that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people, and said the Times' and Post's Pulitzers should be stripped. The Times, in response, tweeted a picture of its Pulitzer winners and noted that every story cited in their prize-winning entry has been proven correct.Top editors at the Times and Post, Dean Baquet and Marty Baron, and CNN chief Jeff Zucker offered similar statements noting it was their organizations' job to show what people in power are doing, and prosecutors' responsibility to determine what is legal or illegal."A sitting president's own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation," Zucker said. "That's not enormous because the media says so. That's enormous because it's unprecedented."Not every top news executive was eager to get involved; representatives for news presidents at ABC, CBS and NBC either turned down or didn't reply to interview requests. "We're going to keep doing our job," MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement."The coverage of the investigation did include embarrassments — specious chyrons, tendentious talking heads and retracted scoops, among them," Columbia's Coll wrote. "Yet it does not follow that American journalism failed because the best-resourced newsrooms in the nation chose to report assiduously on the Mueller investigation and its subjects, only to learn that Mueller did not prove that Trump had conspired with Russia."If there's any media soul-searching to be done, it may involve cable news. In the Trump era, Fox News and MSNBC are frequently the most-watched cable networks in general, both appealing to different camps.Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity has been Trump's biggest advocate on cable news, making him a target for the president's opponents. Yet MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was criticized this week by Slate's Willa Paskin, who said turning on her show "was like discovering a Facebook friend is on the verge of a nervous breakdown." She said that while Maddow's audience was not as malignant as Hannity's, "more than one cable news host can disservice their audience at the same time."Harvard's Gibbs recalls watching reporters and pundits sitting side-by-side on cable panels, with roles confused when pundits were asked what they were hearing and reporters questioned about what they thought.Journalists have long believed that readers and viewers understand the difference between reporting and commentary, Coll said."It would be unrealistic to expect them to make such a distinction now," he said.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsNews Industry Leaders Fighting Back Against Claims by Trump - The New York Times

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________No collusion found in special counsel’s report.The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides conspired or coordinated with the Russian government’s 2016 election interference.Mr. Mueller also reached no conclusion on the charge of obstruction of justice, writing that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” So in a letter to Congress, Attorney General William P. Barr pronounced the president clear of committing any criminal offense. (Read Mr. Barr’s four-page summary of the report here.)Democrats have become skeptical of the summary for a couple of reasons: They’re portraying Mr. Barr’s decision as a hasty, dubious intervention on behalf of the president who installed him and are wondering how a 300-page document could have been summarized in just four.Mr. Barr told lawmakers on Friday that a redacted version of the report would be made public by mid-April. The White House will not see the document before he sends it to Congress, he said.Additional Reading• Democratic Presidential Candidates Call for Release of Special Counsel Report• Trump and Republicans Seek to Turn the Tables in Post-Mueller Washington• Mueller’s Investigation Erases a Line Drawn After WatergateCandidates rolled out policy plans.The conclusion by the special counsel all but assures that Mr. Trump’s political fate will be determined at the ballot box next year — intensifying pressure on 2020 Democratic candidates to start emphasizing the issues they want to bring into the campaign.Some candidates unveiled their first major policy plans this week, hoping to give their campaigns and the primary a little more dimension. Senator Kamala Harris of California has decided to focus on increasing teacher pay. And Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota wants to upgrade the country’s infrastructure.Health care remains poised to be a central issue in the 2020 campaign, but also a divisive one among Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for example, strongly opposed legislation introduced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, saying he preferred a bolder plan of “Medicare for all.”Additional Reading• Inside Kamala Harris’s Small-Dollar Fund-Raising Operation• In 2020 Southern Primaries, Victory for Democrats Begins With Black Women• ‘Newark’s Original Sin’ and the Criminal Justice Education of Cory BookerThe Affordable Care Act came under attack.Democrats won control of the House in large part on the strength of their argument that Congress needs to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions and to lower the cost of health care. On Tuesday, Democratic leaders announced a new legislative package that would build on the Affordable Care Act to do just that.A day earlier, the Trump administration broadened its attack on the health care law, asking a federal appeals court to invalidate it entirely. The surprise decision gave Democrats a chance to move past impeachment and focus on health care and other kitchen-table issues.Mr. Trump was sold on the idea of trying to nullify the law during a heated Oval Office meeting in which Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, prevailed over the vice president and the White House counsel. Many Republicans are worried that a health care fight could empower Democrats as it did in the midterm elections.Additional Reading• What Happens if Obamacare Is Struck Down?• In Blow to Trump, Judge Blocks Health Care Law ‘End Run’Here’s what else happened this week:• The House will try to override the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency and rescue Congress’s bipartisan bid to block his national emergency declaration. Democrats are focusing on military projects threatened by a diversion of funds for border wall construction.• Scientists at the Interior Department spent years examining the threat that pesticides present to hundreds of endangered species. That work was pushed aside after David Bernhardt, now Mr. Trump’s nominee to lead the department, intervened.• The Senate blocked consideration of the Green New Deal after hours of discussion in which Republicans painted its Democratic supporters as out-of-touch socialists and fantasists.• A divided Supreme Court returned to the subject of partisan gerrymandering, considering whether drawing election maps to help the party in power ever violates the Constitution. (Have questions about gerrymandering? We’ve got answers.)• Mr. Trump reversed his administration’s decision to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics, blaming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for the proposal. Ms. DeVos, who had defended the cut to lawmakers despite privately arguing against it, responded with a rare public display of pique._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Is there anything you think we’re missing?

Neal, right, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesBy Nicholas FandosApril 3, 2019WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, using a little-known provision in the federal tax code, formally requested on Wednesday that the I.R.S. hand over six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns, starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration.Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, hand-delivered a two-page letter laying out the request to Charles P. Rettig, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration.Responding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that he would fight the request because, he said, he was being audited.“I guess when you have a name, you are audited, but until such time as I’m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that,” he said.[Read Mr. Neal’s letter to the I.R.S. commissioner.]The move by Mr. Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel’s report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election.And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA, an accounting firm tied to the president, to produce a decade’s worth of Mr. Trump’s financial records.“They have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena,” the chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, told reporters. “And we’ll get them a subpoena.”Unlike the chairmen of other committees, Mr. Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes. Instead, he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax-writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer.Mr. Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request, and if he receives the information, he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff.The provision, which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G. Harding’s administration, at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr. Neal’s. It only says that the Treasury secretary “shall” furnish the information.“President Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns,” said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. “The president is the only person who can sign bills into law, and the public deserves to know whether the president’s personal financial interests affect his public decision making.”The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.But Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts, where its adjudication could take months or longer. Though the provision — No. 6103 in the tax code — is invoked frequently by the committee, there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny.Republicans have vigorously argued against the request, saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent: to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically.VideoThe House Judiciary Committee approved the authorization of a subpoena for a full copy of the Mueller report. The chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he would not issue this subpoena right away.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesRepresentative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, called the request “an abuse of the tax-writing committees’ statutory authority.”“Weaponizing our nation’s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans’ privacy rights,” Mr. Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “As you know, by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.”Defying modern presidential norms, Mr. Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns. Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January.[A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father.]Mr. Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee’s oversight of “the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.” Under I.R.S. policy, the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year. Mr. Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue.“I take the authority to make this request very seriously, and I approach it with the utmost care and respect,” Mr. Neal said in a statement. “This request is about policy, not politics; my preparations were made on my own track and timeline, entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration.”He added, “I trust that in this spirit, the I.R.S. will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner.”In addition to Mr. Trump’s personal returns for 2013 to 2018, Mr. Neal requested returns for Mr. Trump’s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations, including his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. He also asked the I.R.S. to share any information it had related to the entities, including whether they had been audited.Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr. Neal, 70 and a roll-up-your-sleeves legislator, was dragging his feet on making the request. They have organized events in his district, taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly.Mr. Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request, alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff, that could withstand legal challenge.“I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights,” he said on Wednesday.In the Judiciary Committee, the chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report. But the party-line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400-page report to share with lawmakers.“I will give him time to change his mind,” Mr. Nadler said in his opening statement. “But if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials.”The committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration.They included Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; Reince Priebus, the president’s first chief of staff; and Annie Donaldson, a deputy of Mr. McGahn.

"I don't know how to rate this game," said Bayern midfielder Thomas Mueller."That they came back to 4-4 after we led 4-2, so that cannot please us. The match should have gone differently after we went 1-0 up." The Bundesliga champions took the lead through Leon Goretzka’s 12th-minute opener, but goals from Robert Glatzel and Marc Schnatterer put the visitors ahead.Thomas Mueller equalised eight minutes into the second half, before Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry gave the home side a two-goal cushion.

SubscriptionsOn Politics: Inside the White House Fight Over Obamacare - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|On Politics: Inside the White House Fight Over ObamacareAdvertisementSupported byOn Politics: Inside the White House Fight Over ObamacareMarch 28, 2019Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• How did President Trump come to support a court-ordered demolition of the Affordable Care Act? It happened after a heated Oval Office meeting, in which Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, prevailed over the vice president and the White House counsel. Many Republicans are worried that a health care fight could empower Democrats, like it did in the midterm elections.• A decade ago, Senator Cory Booker was the rising-star mayor of Newark with a problem: crime. The way he handled it may offer insights into what kind of president he would be. Here’s a look at Newark’s police department under Mr. Booker.• Days after Attorney General William P. Barr wrote his summary of the still-secret report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, a pressing mystery remains: Why did Mr. Mueller take no position on whether the president obstructed justice?• Russia, which sent two planes carrying military personnel to Venezuela this week, shows little sign of tamping down its involvement there, even as Mr. Trump warned it to “get out.”• Senator Kristen Gillibrand on Wednesday became the first Democratic presidential candidate to disclose her most recent tax returns, challenging her rivals to do to the same.• The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether to cut back the power of administrative agencies, a central goal of the conservative legal movement.• Lawmakers from both parties denounced the Trump administration’s proposal to cut the budgets of the State Department and the main international aid agency by more than 23 percent. The move could threaten national security and hamper diplomacy.• On a day of congressional hearings on federal oversight of the aviation industry, Boeing said it was close to completing a software fix for the 737 Max models, two of which crashed in recent months. Here are some key points.• China’s surrender to Western powers after the first Opium War, and the unequal trade treaties that followed, help explain Beijing’s interest in a global trading order that works more on its terms, historians say. Chinese state media say the Trump administration doesn’t understand that.• Education Secretary Betsy DeVos presented a proposal to cut $17.6 million in federal funding from the Special Olympics this week. It’s drawing much attention and opposition, but it’s unlikely to make it past Congress._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|U.S. Senators Want Stiff Sanctions to Deter Russia Election MeddlingAdvertisementSupported byU.S. Senators Want Stiff Sanctions to Deter Russia Election MeddlingBy ReutersApril 3, 2019WASHINGTON — U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U.S. elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking, energy and defense industries and sovereign debt.The "Deter Act" is the latest effort by U.S. lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior, from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria's civil war to attempts to influence U.S. elections.The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican. They offered a similar measure last year, when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate's Republican leaders, who have close ties to President Donald Trump.Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia, although sometimes reluctantly. Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019, given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats, who are less reluctant than Trump's fellow Republicans to push back against the White House.According to details of the legislation, first reported by Reuters, it would require the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to determine, within 30 days of any federal election, whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government, had engaged in election interference.If the DNI found such interference occurred, the act would require, among other things, that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on, among others, Russian banks and energy companies.The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks: Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank.It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt, Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia's government.The sanctions would include blocking - freezing without seizing - any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction, including senior Russian political figures and business leaders.Russia denies trying to influence U.S. elections. But U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.An investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election, according to a summary released by U.S. Attorney General William Barr last month.The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U.S. intelligence has identified China, Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats. It also asks that Trump's administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U.S. elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern.The senators timed the bill's release to come after the end of Mueller's investigation, which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump's presidency, and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the NATO alliance, who has focused on the threat posed by Russia.

Members of Robert Mueller’s team said their findings were more damaging than originally suggested.Some investigators told associates that Attorney General William Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry, according to government officials. It was the first evidence of simmering tensions between the special counsel’s team and the Justice Department.At stake is the narrative of one of the most consequential investigations in American history. Some members of Mr. Mueller’s team are concerned that Americans’ views of the investigation will have hardened before the full report becomes public._____ImageCreditIllustration by Joan Wong2.

A low boil on Capitol Hill.House Democrats, above, authorized a subpoena to get a full copy of the Mueller report, setting up a confrontation with the Justice Department. Practically speaking, the move does not ensure that Congress will get what it wants.The House also passed a nonbinding resolution that condemns the Trump administration for pushing a federal court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act. Republicans called it an empty gesture.A House committee formally requested on Wednesday that the I.R.S. hand over six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns.And with dozens of Mr. Trump’s judicial and sub-cabinet nominees held up by Democrats, Senate Republicans invoked a “nuclear option” to speed up confirmations._____ImageCredit@joebiden, via Twitter4. “I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility.”In a video, Joe Biden pledged to be more “respectful” of personal space, working to buffer his potential 2020 bid from multiple complaints of unwanted physical contact. The former vice president said he realized “social norms have begun to change.”On the official campaign trail, the Trump campaign has quietly installed allies in the most significant state parties, urging them to discourage conservative criticism of the president._____ImageCreditSarah Rice for The New York Times5.

The former prosecutor is the first African-American woman and the first openly gay person elected as Chicago’s mayor. Possibly a part of her appeal: In a city scarred by corruption, she has never held elective office.When Ms. Lightfoot replaces Rahm Emanuel in May, she will inherit a scandal-prone police department and a persistently high homicide rate._____Image7.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Oliver North Showed Republicans the Way OutAdvertisementOpinionSupported byOliver North Showed Republicans the Way OutBelligerence, shamelessness and partisanship can take you far.By Jamelle BouieOpinion ColumnistMarch 28, 2019ImageA television broadcast of Oliver North’s 1987 congressional testimony during the Iran-contra hearings.CreditCreditRuby Washington/The New York TimesWatergate, the modern template for an impeachment-worthy scandal, has informed much of the coverage of the Russia scandal, from congressional inquiries to the special counsel’s investigation into President Trump and his campaign. Central questions — Did the president conspire to illegally influence the election? Did he obstruct justice? — have clear antecedents in Watergate. And Trump himself bears more than a slight resemblance to Richard Nixon at his most paranoid and intransigent.But while Trump’s belligerent and at times bizarre behavior may mirror that of his predecessor, he is operating in a vastly different political context than Nixon was in the 1970s. Then, the Republican Party had an influential moderate faction willing to work with Democrats. Now it’s synonymous with the right-wing. Then, fact-finding produced public consensus and eventually pushed Republicans to do the right thing. Now it heightens the partisan divide.For this and other reasons, the Watergate example doesn’t fit the circumstances of the moment. But Iran-contra, the major scandal of the Reagan administration, does.The main details of Iran-contra are straightforward. In 1982, the United States began backing the contras, the right-wing paramilitary opposition to Nicaragua’s left-wing Sandinista government. Late in 1983, controversy over this assistance led Congress to pull its support. President Ronald Reagan, determined to stop what he saw as the spread of communism in Central America, directed his national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, to “keep the contras together body and soul.”Over the next two years, multiple administration officials would work to circumvent Congress’s prohibition on American involvement, first through fund-raising — soliciting $32 million from Saudi Arabia over several years — and then through illegal arms sales to Iran, spearheaded by a National Security Council staff member, Oliver North. In 1986, the scheme exploded into public view after the Lebanese magazine Al Shiraa published the story of the arms sales to Iran and Sandinista forces downed a cargo plane carrying weapons and other supplies for the contras.The scandal implicated top cabinet and administration officials, with strong evidence tying Vice President George H.W. Bush to the conspiracy as well. Figures with direct involvement, like North and Adm. John Poindexter (who succeeded McFarlane as national security adviser), altered records and lied to Congress in an attempt to stymie investigators and insulate the president from culpability.The particular twists and turns of Iran-contra don’t mirror the Russia scandal’s. The politics, however, do. As with Trump and Russia, the White House itself was defiant. “Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North put their careers on the line to protect our country,” Pat Buchanan, then serving as White House communications director, said at a rally in Miami in December 1986. “If Colonel North broke any rules, he will stand up and take it as the Marine he is. But I say, if Colonel North ripped off the ayatollah and took some $30 million to give to the contras, God bless Colonel North.”Most Republicans outside the administration also stood firmly behind the Reagan administration, even in the face of clear wrongdoing. “I don’t want you prosecuted,” Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said to North during the colonel’s testimony before a House and Senate select committee on the scandal in 1987. “I don’t. I don’t think many people in America do. And I think there’s going to be one lot of hell raised if you are.”The minority report of the select committee — written by its Republican members, including Dick Cheney, then representing Wyoming — was dismissive of claims of malfeasance. “The bottom line,” it reads, “is that the mistakes of the Iran-contra Affair were just that — mistakes in judgment, and nothing more. There was no constitutional crisis, no systematic disrespect for ‘the rule of law,’ no grand conspiracy, and no Administration-wide dishonesty or cover-up.”Later, as congressional hearings gave way to a federal investigation, Republicans would attack the inquiry outright.“Lawrence Walsh’s bungling Iran-contra operation has struck out again,” said the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, slamming the independent counsel who led a yearslong investigation of the affair. “Unfortunately, the American taxpayers continue to be the real losers, watching their tax dollars going down the drain to maintain Mr. Walsh’s exercise in futility.”The public might have been initially skeptical of President Reagan’s claims of ignorance, but Republican unity in the face of intense scrutiny kept that from spiraling into a full-blown political crisis. Reagan left office on a high note, with 63 percent approval in December 1988. Nor did the scandal derail Bush, who won the presidency just a month before.For the 22 months of Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Trump and his associates, Republicans have followed an almost identical approach. They’ve stuck by his side, shielding him from congressional investigators and defending his public conduct. Unlike Nixon, and to a greater extent than Reagan, Trump has also had the help of a powerful conservative media ecosystem ready to amplify his rhetoric, attack his political adversaries and even provide material for his verbal assaults.If Mueller’s inquiry had ended with a bombshell revelation like the one in Watergate — where Nixon essentially confessed to obstruction of justice on tape, asking the director and the deputy director of the C.I.A. to pressure the F.B.I. into ending its investigation of the break-in — this protective strategy might have collapsed against the force of the facts. Instead, the report, at least as summarized by Attorney General William Barr, landed with a thud.Barr clears Trump of wrongdoing, using Mueller’s inability to “establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities” to conclude that neither Trump nor his campaign “conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.”Barr — who recommended pardons for key actors in Iran-contra as attorney general for George H.W. Bush in 1991 and who ruled out charging a president with obstruction in an unsolicited June 2018 memo — also determined that the “evidence developed” during the investigation “is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”Instead of ending in drama like Watergate, the Russia scandal is likely to fade away like Iran-contra. There is still a report to read — reportedly more than 300 pages long — but President Trump has already declared victory. He is now a little less damaged ahead of his re-election campaign, a testament to how belligerence, shamelessness and partisanship can undermine any attempt to hold a president or his allies accountable for wrongdoing.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

By Andrea KannapellMarch 29, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. A seemingly endless Brexit twists along, a triumphant President Trump points fingers, and a portrait of a seething Nissan offers a backdrop to the fall of Carlos Ghosn. Here’s the latest: ImagePrime Minister Theresa May leaving 10 Downing Street on Wednesday.CreditAlastair Grant/Associated PressFor the 1,000th time, what’s next for Brexit?It seems Prime Minister Theresa May’s sacrificial promise to resign in exchange for support for her withdrawal plan has made little difference.Parliament remains deadlocked. A third vote on her twice-rejected plan will take place in Parliament today, but a third rejection is entirely possible.To add to the complications, none of the eight alternative Brexit plans on which lawmakers voted on Wednesday mustered a majority, setting the stage for yet another round of debates in Parliament next week.Analysis: Mrs. May’s resignation offer was a surprising move for a woman who, over the last two years, has bounced back from crises with unflappable resolve. “The sight of this proud, rigid woman admitting that she could not finish the job, giving up her hopes of ever being remembered as anything but Brexit roadkill, was a somber one,” writes our London correspondent Ellen Barry.The next prime minister: British bookmakers are already offering odds on who they think will step up when Mrs. May steps down. ImageAt a rally in Michigan, President Trump revived some of the insurgent spirit that had fueled his campaign in 2016. CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times“The Russia hoax is finally dead.”That was President Trump, reveling in his first rally since the end of the 22-month Mueller investigation, ridiculing those who sought the inquiry and the news media that did not overtly back him. “After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump declared. “The collusion delusion is over.”There were greater-than-usual concerns about trouble at the rally, with security personnel more visible and sturdier barriers between the news media and the audience. But the mood in the crowd seemed no more intense, our reporters found, than at previous Trump rallies.The Mueller report: The Justice Department acknowledged that the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was more than 300 pages long, raising questions about what was left out of Attorney General William Barr’s four-page summary of Mr. Mueller’s findings.Congress: The House Intelligence Committee’s first hearing since the completion of the report devolved into tumult. Republican members called on the chairman, Adam Schiff, an outspoken Trump critic, to resign. He accused them of turning a blind eye to President Trump’s wrongdoing.ImageA family in Syria sitting beneath posters of Iran’s allies, including President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.CreditGeorge Outfalian/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesU.S. sanctions trickle down to Iran’s network of alliesHezbollah fighters directed by Iran to fight the Islamic State have missed paychecks. Promised funds and support to help Syria rebuild have failed to materialize.The Trump administration says the punitive sanctions on Iran are working as they were meant to: undermining Iranian support for militant groups and political allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.Context: Iran has long used its patronage of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen to boost its influence and counter the powers of Saudi Arabia and Israel.Caution: Analysts question whether the lack of Iranian support will change the behavior of these groups, which remain ideologically committed to Iran’s agenda and can promote it through local politics.“When you try to push Iran out of the region by sanctioning it,” said one expert, “you are forcing it to get involved in the region even more.” ImageThe Brunt Ice ShelfCreditRosemary Calvert/AlamyA massive iceberg is about to split off from AntarcticaTwo rifts on the Brunt Ice Shelf, in West Antarctica, are close to calving, or breaking off, creating an iceberg over 560 square miles (1,450 square kilometers) in size — about twice the size of New York City.The rifts were stable for 30 years, but in 2016, an image showed the two advancing toward each other. Scientists say the break could trigger the further retreat of the entire shelf. We’ve mapped the timeline of the split.From the archives: In 2017, we published an in-depth look into the risk of Antarctica’s ice sheets collapsing as a result of global warming. Last year, we reported that the region was melting three times as fast as it was a decade earlier. Here’s what else is happeningLyft: The ride-hailing app priced its shares at $72 a pop at its I.P.O., putting its value at $24.3 billion. Its market debut was the biggest so far this year. Uber — its main rival in North America — is expected to have an even bigger I.P.O., reflecting investors’ demand for a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings that have created the gig economy.Nissan: Once seen as a model of global cooperation, the Nissan-Renault alliance seethed with fear and rivalries. Our reporter reconstructs an environment ripe for exactly the kind of back-stabbing that Carlos Ghosn, the company’s former chairman, says brought him down.Huawei: A British review found “significant” security problems with the Chinese company’s telecommunications equipment that governments and independent hackers could exploit, posing risks to national security. But the report stopped short of banning the company’s equipment in the country. U.S.-China tension: The Trump administration is pushing a Chinese firm, Beijing Kunlun, to relinquish its ownership of Grinder over concerns that Beijing could use personal information on the U.S.-based app — like sexual orientation or dating habits — to blackmail or influence American officials. France: An outburst of attacks against Roma this week was fueled by false reports of child kidnappings that circulated on social media. It’s the latest example of the platforms being used to fan prejudice, with dangerous, or even deadly, consequences.Brunei: Beginning April 3, the country will implement Islamic laws that would punish adultery and gay sex with death by stoning, despite immense international pushback. The laws would apply to Muslims, non-Muslims and foreigners alike. Saudi Arabia: Three women who were among the activists arrested last spring as they campaigned for an expansion of Saudi women’s rights were granted release, though the case against them and their fellow activists will proceed. ImageCreditTiffany KoschFrogs: The first global analysis of a fungus that has been wiping out frogs for decades demonstrates that it is, in the words of one researcher, “the most deadly pathogen known to science.” It has caused major declines in more than 500 species of frogs around the world, and at least 90 are presumed to have gone extinct.Wow Airlines: The Icelandic budget airline ceased operations after talks over financing fell apart. All its flights have been canceled. New Zealand: The country’s immigration agency said that registrations of interest to live and work there — the first step toward applying for a visa — had increased in the 10 days after this month’s mosque attacks, compared with the 10 days leading up to it. Much of the interest came from Americans and people in predominantly Muslim countries.Salman Rushdie: In his first book review for The Times in almost two decades, the author vouches for “The Old Drift” by Namwali Serpell, a sweeping debut novel about the roots of modern Zambia. It ranges skillfully, he writes, “between historical and science fiction, shifting gears between political argument, psychological realism and rich fabulism.” (Mr. Rushdie’s last book review for The Times was of Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland” in 1990.)No pain, more gained? A 71-year-old British woman has never experienced pain or anxiety, even during childbirth and surgery.

All its flights have been canceled. New Zealand: The country’s immigration agency said that registrations of interest to live and work there — the first step toward applying for a visa — had increased in the 10 days after this month’s mosque attacks, compared with the 10 days leading up to it. Much of the interest came from Americans and people in predominantly Muslim countries.Salman Rushdie: In his first book review for The Times in almost two decades, the author vouches for “The Old Drift” by Namwali Serpell, a sweeping debut novel about the roots of modern Zambia. It ranges skillfully, he writes, “between historical and science fiction, shifting gears between political argument, psychological realism and rich fabulism.” (Mr. Rushdie’s last book review for The Times was of Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland” in 1990.)No pain, more gained? A 71-year-old British woman has never experienced pain or anxiety, even during childbirth and surgery.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.‘Not a Good Look’Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has not officially announced his campaign for president, but it has already run into its first big obstacle: Biden was accused last week of inappropriately touching Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman, during a rally in 2014.The charge has created days’ worth of headlines, but Jimmy Fallon noted that after President Trump won in 2016 — despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct — this hardly seemed like a disqualifier.“It’s not a good look for Biden. If any other women come forward and say he acted inappropriate, he could get elected president.” — JIMMY FALLONCreditCreditVideo by The Late Show With Stephen ColbertOn “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert acted out parts of Flores’s account. She said Biden embraced her from behind and nuzzled her hair just before they went onstage at a campaign event.“Mm, is that Garnier Fructis?” Colbert mumbled, imitating Biden. “Are you relaxed yet? No? You actually seem more tense than when I started. Here, let me kiss the top of your head.”Trevor Noah said Biden’s actions rated pretty high on the creepy-conduct scale.“Honestly, smelling hair is one of the creepiest things you can do. It’s on the list of creepy things — it’s right after ‘collecting doll parts’ and ‘sneezing with your eyes open.’” — TREVOR NOAHBarr’s ‘Summary’Attorney General William P. Barr released a statement on Friday clarifying that the four-page letter he put out discussing the Mueller report should not be seen as a full summary. He said the letter, which seemed to broadly outline the findings of the report, “was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the special counsel’s investigation or report.” Seth Meyers found that confusing.“Wait, so it wasn’t supposed to be a summary? That’s kind of an important detail to leave out. That’s like reading the line, ‘The prince and the princess lived happily ever after’ in a fairy tale, and then you turn the page and there’s a note saying, ‘That was not — and should not — be mischaracterized as the ending. They got divorced the next day.” — SETH MEYERSApril Fools’ DayMeyers commemorated April Fools’ Day not with a prank but with some dark humor.“Today was April Fools’ Day, so if you saw anything in the news that was positive, that’s why.” — SETH MEYERSFor his part, Stephen Colbert did his best to prove Meyers right with a wry joke about Trump’s border policies.“Trump is still concerned with our southern border. In response to a surge of migrants coming into this country, Trump unveiled a new approach that treats asylum seekers fairly and humanely. April Fools’! I gotcha.” — STEPHEN COLBERTThe Punchiest Punchlines (CBD Edition)“I heard that pretty soon Walgreens was going to start selling CBD products in their stores. Meanwhile, you can get actual weed at any Walmart if you just raise your eyebrows at the right employee.” — JIMMY FALLON“Indiana mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has announced his campaign has raised $7 million in the last three months. But unfortunately he’s just going to use the money to buy more vowels.” — SETH MEYERS, showing the mayor’s name spelled “Buittigieigie”The Bits Worth WatchingFor Jimmy Kimmel, pranking his Aunt Chippy will never get old.“The Late Show” took a peek into Kellyanne Conway’s brain as she tried to explain the president’s health care plans.What We’re Excited About on Tuesday NightTiffany Haddish, who recently announced that she would be hosting “Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,” a Netflix series devoted to younger comics, will sit down with Kimmel on Tuesday.Also, Check This OutImageHere’s an eight-minute look at how the budding 17-year-old pop star Billie Eilish made her hit song, “Bury a Friend.”Plus, Ideas for What to Watch Tonight:The 50 Best Movies on Netflix Right NowThe 25 Best Films of the 21st CenturyThe Best Movies on Amazon Prime Video Right NowAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsOpinion | Trump’s Circus Maximus - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSunday ReviewSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperSunday Review|Trump’s Circus MaximusAdvertisementOpinionSupported byTrump’s Circus MaximusBy Maureen DowdOpinion ColumnistMarch 30, 2019ImageWas President Trump doing a “Low-Energy Jeb!” impersonation in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday?CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — It was going to be epic, like those Roman triumph celebrations where the generals would ride in on a chariot decorated with gold and ivory, so drunk on power that a slave would have to walk behind, holding a wreath over the general’s head and whispering in his ear, “Remember you are mortal.”Against all odds, Donald Trump had won the day, leaving his enemies stunned. The president had wrested the “No Collusion” headline he dearly craved, and Thursday he would claim his laurels. It was a moment to strut and gloat and curse and insult. From the president’s point of view, which is the only point of view that matters to him, it looked like Watergate in reverse.This was the night for Smugness Maximus.Looking out at the sea of red MAGA hats, a cockier-than-usual Don Jr., who opened for his father, said that this week MAGA stood for “Michael Avenatti Got Arrested.” The bend-the-knee mood was best summed up by the T-shirt of a man with a goatee and neck tattoo: “BITCH I’M THE PRESIDENT!”Michigan was the place to rub it in, because it will always be remembered as a place Hillary forgot. It was strange, though, to have the victorious Vulgarian spewing bile right across the Grand River from the resting place of Gerald Ford, whose museum here offers words associated with Ford that seem quaint by Trump standards: Trustworthy, Respectful, Team Player, Compassion, Steady Leader.Talking to people out on the floor, it was clear that they expected this to be a special “lovefest,” as one put it. They were thrilled at the prospect that Trump would be “the beast unleashed,” as one man said, unburdened and with his shoulders held high and his stride more confident. A rallygoer likened it to cyclists getting to use two pedals of a bicycle when they had been able to use only one.Up in the stands, Juli Arndt waved a “Women for Trump” sign. She had left her husband in charge of their business, Corky’s Beal City Tavern, to make the hour-and-a-half trip here. “I knew there was no collusion. I just had a feeling. I trust him. The only thing he hasn’t done that he promised to do is put Crooked Hillary in jail.”I noted that Jared and Ivanka had also now landed in hot water for using private accounts for official business.“Not to that extent,” she said.And then Trump appeared, running hot at the start. His former campaign advisers Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie had been on Air Force One with him and they were no doubt pumping him up en route, whispering to him, “Remember you are immortal.” At the rally, Trumpsters treated the two swamp creatures like stars, asking them to autograph their merch.But Trump did not seem to be savoring his triumph so much as wallowing in his victimhood, in what he sees as the unfair attempt by “major losers” to treat his presidency as illegitimate. He does not get the irony, that the way he first made his name in national politics was painting Barack Obama as illegitimate.Robert Mueller may not have exonerated the president on obstruction, but the president, of course, exonerated himself, bragging at the rally, “total exoneration, complete vindication.”He denounced his tormentors in the Democratic Party and the media as “sick, sick” and, referring to his raft of critics on MSNBC, crowed that “their ratings dropped through the floor last night.” Because, in Trump’s simplistic mind, that is the worst thing that can happen to anyone.When Trump describes what he sees as the plot against him, it is a mirror image of what his foes see: a fraud perpetrated by corrupt people, “a sinister effort to undermine” the election and a poisoning of the national debate that has left us hurt and divided and “on artificial respirators,” tearing “the fabric of our great democracy.”Trump engaged in his usual weird meandering, saying of his voters: “I always say they came from the valleys. They came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don’t know what you were doing in the river, but they came from the cities, they came and they came and they didn’t even know.”He was in such a good mood that he allowed himself a favorite indulgence: knifing a top adviser in the perfect setting. Just as he excluded devout Catholic Sean Spicer from a meeting with the pope in Rome, he humiliated Betsy DeVos in a town where many buildings bear her last name, having “overridden my people” by reversing her decision to cut funding for the Special Olympics.For the last hour of the speech, Trump went flat, simply resorting to golden oldies. (He had already managed to step on his own parade in the dumbest way possible against the recommendation of his top people and Kevin McCarthy when he jumped back into the quicksand of health care.)It’s not clear why, on a night when his aides promised high energy, he seemed to lose altitude. Did he miss having Mueller as a foil? Did he know in his heart that he was guilty of some of those sins? Is he tired of rallies even before the 2020 race gets well underway? Does he know that his “No Collusion” headline will not change the minds of all those Americans who disdain him? Or is he being a sore winner again?Maybe Trump, like America, is just tired of winning.

And so it was that the White House took the opportunity afforded by the Mueller investigation’s wrap-up to back a lawsuit against Obamacare that even the health care law’s conservative critics believe is frivolous, reviving a debate that tanked Trump’s approval rating during 2017’s repeal-and-replace debacle, and that no Republican of consequence wants to reopen today.Then just to add an extra self-inflicted wound, the administration this week also endorsed defunding the Special Olympics — a position that lasted all of 48 hours before Trump reversed it, blaming “my people” rather than himself.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]What unites both of these blunders, apart from simple political stupidity, is that neither has much to do with actual policymaking. There is little chance that John Roberts, having declined to do away with Obamacare when the law faced a reasonable constitutional challenge, will rule in favor of a more implausible attack. There is zero chance that the Special Olympics will be defunded; the budget that imagined doing so was a symbolic statement that gets ignored by Congress every year.So why revive the Obamacare debate? Why set yourself up for “Trump Defunds Special Olympics” headlines? The answer is that there are effectively two Trump presidencies. One offers something like what the president promised on the campaign trail — a break with Paul Ryan’s green-eyeshade approach to entitlement reform, a more moderate tack on health care, an indifference to Obama-era conservative orthodoxies on fiscal and monetary policy.The other offers a continuation of the Tea Party’s insistence on spending cuts and Obamacare repeal, and appropriately its present leader is a former Tea Party congressman — Mick Mulvaney, the Zelig of the administration, whose zeal is apparently the main reason that the Obamacare lawsuit now has administration support.The first presidency is mostly real; the second presidency has been mostly imaginary ever since the failure of Obamacare repeal left Ryanism neutered. Trump hasn’t done some of the biggest heterodox things he promised (an infrastructure bill, most notably). But he has ended austerity budgeting, ignored entitlement reform, reformed Obamacare around the edges while leaving its coverage guarantee intact, embraced protectionism and jawboned the Federal Reserve to be more inflationary.At the same time, though, he has relied on personnel who are associated with 2010-era G.O.P. orthodoxy, rather than elevating the kind of conservatives who have actively theorized for a more populist right. Trump's choice of Steve Moore to the Federal Reserve is a recent case study: Instead of elevating a principled inflation dove (National Review editor and Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru would have been my outside-the-box choice), Trump picked a hack who was obsessed with imaginary inflation under Obama, and only flipped to back a looser monetary policy because, well, it was the Trumpy thing to do.But at least with Moore, Trump is getting someone whose official views now line up with his administration’s political interests. With Mulvaney he has something stranger: A subordinate who plays let’s-pretend-to-be-the-Tea-Party whenever he gets the chance, limning an essentially fictional version of the Trump presidency in budget documents and pushing the president to publicly back forays like the Obamacare lawsuit that have little chance of changing anything.You could describe the cut-the-Special-Olympics budgets and anti-Obamacare efforts as just classic Republican hypocrisy, the tribute that big-spending vice plays to small-government virtue. But Trump campaigned in 2016 as the guy who would get rid of this charade, who would actually identify as a free-spending populist rather than a movement conservative, who would enable the G.O.P. to be a “worker’s party” in its self-conception rather than just in its compromises with political reality.Instead, thanks to his “people” and his own rhetorical shifts, he’s ended up in a weirder position. The Trump record would justify, within limits, campaigning in 2020 the way he did in 2016, claiming to have governed as a populist rather than a Ryanist — taking credit for reforming Obamacare rather than eliminating it, taking credit for Congress’s guns-and-butter budgets and all the popular spending they contain.But right now Trump is letting the mostly-imaginary version of his presidency, the Mulvaney version, define his priorities and public rhetoric. Which makes him look like a guy who didn’t keep his promises, who promised to be a different kind of Republican and then kept trying to defund the Special Olympians and throw people off their health care coverage.That’s the most unpopular version of Trumpism, which is saying something. And his chances in 2020 will turn, in part, on whether he realizes it. His real economic record, however haphazard and under-theorized, could still win him re-election. The Mulvaney fantasia guarantees defeat.RelatedOpinion | Jamelle Bouie: An Opening for the DemocratsMarch 29, 2019Opinion | Paul Krugman: G.O.P.

Even if you secretly doubted that he was actually well-organized enough to run an international conspiracy, it made you depressed to see him looking so happy.But then he took off on the worst victory lap since — well, do you remember that baseball player who celebrated his grand slam home run by leaping in the air and fracturing a leg?“We’re not talking about health care right now, but I will,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday.He also vowed to make the Republicans “the party of health care.” Great strategy! The Republicans have no health care plan or even a plan about how to get one. Trying to get rid of Obamacare had been their most humiliating failure in the two years they controlled the White House and Congress. Last thing in the world they want to bring up.“I understand health care now especially very well,” Trump bragged. This was at a press conference with the wife of the opposition leader in Venezuela. All over the country, his party members wished he had stuck to Caracas.And who knew Trump was so well briefed? Remember back in the day, when our then-new president complained that “nobody knew that health care could be so complicated”? Now he’s apparently got it worked out. Those famous late-night cramming sessions sure did the trick.Republicans in Congress began desperately leaking the news that they had tried to talk their alleged leader out of the idea. The Democrats were almost swooning with joy. Really, Trump could not have made them happier if he’d announced that he planned to unveil a new tax cut called Help for The Greedy Rich.Nancy Pelosi, who’s been struggling to quash battles between left and center in her House caucus, got the best birthday present conceivable. Every wing of her party ran on making Obamacare better. Now all they’ll have to do is promise to make it Not Gone.Obamacare does need work. The original plan was a mooshed-up compromise with the insurance companies, and Trump has been sabotaging it whenever possible. But still, it provides coverage for about 20 million Americans. And there is no evidence that, even in red states, average people want to see it go away. In the last election, voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska supported expanding their states’ programs.Pelosi was already pushing a bill that would put a cap on how much premiums could cost Obamacare customers, as well as protecting popular coverage like prescription drugs and maternity care.It’ll never become law while Trump is in office. But now, when the Republicans try to argue against the bill, they’ll be reminded approximately every three seconds that their party’s alternative is to dump the whole program in favor of a new plan that is yet to be named. Or written. Or discussed. Or given a hashtag.So what got into the president? Maybe somebody was trying to divert him from another attack on John McCain. (“Donald, nobody can defame a dead war hero like you do. But why don’t you take a break and suggest something new.”)Maybe Trump was bored. The right intended to follow the happy news about the Mueller report with a demand for new investigations into Bill and Hillary Clinton. For most of America, that’s about as exciting a prospect as bringing back “Duck Dynasty.”Even while everybody from Mike Pence to the janitor was allegedly urging the president to stay away from health care at all costs, there were plenty of people to egg him on.Some Republican state attorneys general have been in court trying to get Obamacare overturned. This week the Justice Department announced its support, and it will be filing a brief, presumably backing the argument that the founding fathers never would have wanted to protect people with pre-existing conditions.Mick Mulvaney, the powerful head of the Office of Management and Budget, seems to have been the leader of the let’s-pile-on crowd. He’s always been an administration star. Who can forget the time he told reporters the government couldn’t afford to support Meals on Wheels? Or the time he counted the same $2 trillion twice? Or the time he told a reporter that the budget the administration submitted to Congress was not necessarily “indicative of what our proposals are”?Mulvaney is also currently serving as the acting White House chief of staff, following the departure of John (I’m-Holding-My-Head-in-My-Hands-Again) Kelly. He could have several more jobs by the time we get to Easter. People are beginning to notice that the acting secretary of defense is a former top official at Boeing.So here we are. Polls are showing that the public is apparently still on the collusion bandwagon. Trump sits proudly at the head of an administration that includes very few people who could be trusted running your local 7Eleven. He’s just proposed a plan approximately as popular as banning summer vacation. And we haven’t even gotten to April. Didn’t somebody say something about the cruelest month?The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

The campaign has a staff of about 40 members and counting.CreditCreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesBy Annie Karni and Maggie HabermanMarch 29, 2019WASHINGTON — On a former trading floor in an office tower in Rosslyn, Va., with sweeping views of the Potomac River, the Trump 2020 campaign is settling in. It has about 40 staff members and counting, reported $19.2 million in cash on hand in its last report and has spent $4.5 million on online ads since December.It is a long way from Mr. Trump’s first presidential race, which came together in the summer of 2015 and was run as a taped-together operation, with a few desks strewn across an unfinished floor of Trump Tower.But one thing is missing from the high-powered but traditional campaign operation underway in Rosslyn: a candidate who abides by tradition.In a speech to a conservative group this month, as Mr. Trump described what he had in mind, he made a point of recounting “how I got elected, by being off script,” adding, “If we don’t go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks.” And at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday, Mr. Trump illustrated what he meant, delivering an 80-minute stemwinder in which he lashed out at familiar targets who fostered “the collusion delusion” and offered the in-depth rehash of his 2016 victory that is a staple of his rally speeches.“We won a lot,” he said, after explaining where “Crooked” Hillary Clinton went wrong. “We won 306 to 223.” (Mrs. Clinton’s total was actually 232.)ImageMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to run on the same anti-immigration, anti-Islam, fear-mongering tropes that lifted him to victory in 2016.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to run on the same anti-immigration, anti-Islam, fear-mongering tropes that lifted him to victory in 2016, denouncing old enemies like Mrs. Clinton and adding new ones, even as his aides try to emphasize his accomplishments in office like the economy and the rout of the Islamic State. Advisers say privately that he has been distracted by the Mueller report, which he regards as a clear political victory, and has not focused on message for the coming months.As the campaign tries to build a traditional re-election operation, which officials often compare to President George W. Bush’s 2004 race, the tension may build between campaign officials and Mr. Trump, who trusts his gut above all else.“President Trump has always had his finger on the pulse of the nation and he understands what it is that the American people want, and that is why he won in 2016 and that has not changed,” said David Bossie, a former campaign adviser who, alongside the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, attended the rally with Mr. Trump on Thursday night. “He is his best political barometer.”Incumbent presidents running for re-election always come with built-in advantages: money, time, the stature of the office and the opportunity to define the terms of the race, while an inchoate field of opponents fight among one another.The Trump campaign is building an organization aimed at capitalizing on all of those advantages, crafting a conventional structure around a candidate whose nature is to buck against it. “There are lots of differences between being part of a bruising primary versus being the incumbent,” said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign communications director. “One of the differences is time. We have a big advantage on the Democrat field in that, and we intend to use it.”ImageA view of the Potomac River from the headquarters.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesBut the wild card is Mr. Trump himself.“It’s easy to build a beautiful operation,” said Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 race. “The message becomes the gas in the tank.”For now, the Trump campaign is focused on giving its candidate the infrastructure for success and, as the race is in its early stages, giving him the room he craves to dictate his own script.Mr. Trump is focused on vengeance after the end of the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his campaign aides are indulging him, attacking the Democrats who have sought to investigate him and the reporters who have written about it. Mr. Trump, whom critics have repeatedly described as “corrupt,” has tried to affix both terms to the news media.Privately, some Trump advisers acknowledge those attacks may have a shelf life, and that they are deploying them in part to blunt questions about Mr. Trump’s own credibility.But aides say that Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and without the Mueller investigation to swing at and no clear Democratic challenger likely to emerge for months, the press is his stand-in.ImageMaddison Stewart, left, and Christina Angel at the headquarters. To staff the campaign, advisers have brought in a mix of new hires and veterans of the 2016 effort.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesIn addition to the challenges posed by Mr. Trump’s preference for fights and distractions, the campaign faces headwinds that he did not as a first-time candidate. Democrats and Republicans see an electoral map that will be far more challenging for Mr. Trump, whose support in three key states has sagged, and who faced an invigorated and organic level of Democratic turnout.To staff the campaign, advisers have brought in a mix of new hires and veterans of the 2016 effort. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager who speaks frequently with the president, has consulted extensively with veterans of past presidential runs, relying increasingly on Karl Rove, the architect of Mr. Bush’s re-election effort.The polling team is expected to look similar to the one from 2016. It is likely to be led by Tony Fabrizio, a veteran Republican pollster who worked on Mr. Trump’s first race. Others such as John McLaughlin and the Polling Company, a firm formerly owned by the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, will be involved as well. The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, meanwhile, is planning to play a large managerial role overseeing the campaign from the West Wing and speaks to Mr. Parscale multiple times a day.Former senior White House officials like Bill Stepien, who left recently as political director, and Justin Clark, who headed up the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, have joined the campaign. Other former campaign aides are expected to join the re-election effort in the coming weeks. And Mr. Murtaugh has been over to the White House to meet with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, and others speak frequently with Mr. Stepien’s replacement, Brian Jack, and Tim Pataki, who took over for Mr. Clark.The campaign has also been hosting orientation days at its headquarters to train regional political directors and a group it has branded Trump Neighborhood Team Leaders. Next week, it plans to start a program called the Trump Victory State Director College, which campaign officials described as a competitive training program, complete with written exams, snap assignments and surprise simulations, in which there will be people competing for a limited number of slots.ImageThe headquarters’ “war room.”CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesMr. Stepien, meanwhile, has been focused on the delegate selection process and state chairman races in places like Massachusetts, Florida and Maine, to ensure that the Republican National Convention next year will be an uninterrupted celebration of the president. Mr. Trump’s experience at the 2016 convention, when a group of “Never Trump” Republicans that included high-profile delegates like Ginni Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, was a searing experience for him, aides say, and his team is looking to avoid a repeat.The spending rate has concerned some outside allies, who have raised questions about the extensive digital investment so early in the campaign. The billionaire Todd Ricketts has been named a finance chairman, reaching out with his team to the donors who were not supportive of Mr. Trump in 2016.And the campaign has been focused on tying all of the potential Democratic 2020 nominees to the most progressive names in the party, branding them all as “socialists” whose views are too far to the left for general-election voters. Mr. Parscale has discussed with Mr. Trump the potential advantages of targeting the Green New Deal, the ambitious Democratic proposal to combat climate change.In an interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump acknowledged that advice was setting in. “I don’t want to speak badly about the New Green Deal, Sean, because frankly I’m afraid that they’ll stop using it, because I really do want to, you know, campaign against it,” Mr. Trump said.But when it comes to telling a compelling story to the public, Mr. Trump will be running his own show, and campaign aides acknowledge that they are only taking cues from the president.There is also another factor at play, which is how much of his time Mr. Trump is willing to give them.After two years in office, Mr. Trump, 72, is tired, aides said. The unstoppable campaigner, so far, will commit to participating in only one campaign event a day, and recently balked at a possible rally out West during a fund-raising swing. The rally may still happen, people familiar with the plans said, but only because campaign officials insisted on it.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Traditional Campaign, Except for One Thing: Wild-Card Candidate.

It has about 40 staff members and counting, reported $19.2 million in cash on hand in its last report and has spent $4.5 million on online ads since December.It is a long way from Mr. Trump’s first presidential race, which came together in the summer of 2015 and was run as a taped-together operation, with a few desks strewn across an unfinished floor of Trump Tower.But one thing is missing from the high-powered but traditional campaign operation underway in Rosslyn: a candidate who abides by tradition.In a speech to a conservative group this month, as Mr. Trump described what he had in mind, he made a point of recounting “how I got elected, by being off script,” adding, “If we don’t go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks.” And at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday, Mr. Trump illustrated what he meant, delivering an 80-minute stemwinder in which he lashed out at familiar targets who fostered “the collusion delusion” and offered the in-depth rehash of his 2016 victory that is a staple of his rally speeches.“We won a lot,” he said, after explaining where “Crooked” Hillary Clinton went wrong. “We won 306 to 223.” (Mrs. Clinton’s total was actually 232.)ImageMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to run on the same anti-immigration, anti-Islam, fear-mongering tropes that lifted him to victory in 2016.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to run on the same anti-immigration, anti-Islam, fear-mongering tropes that lifted him to victory in 2016, denouncing old enemies like Mrs. Clinton and adding new ones, even as his aides try to emphasize his accomplishments in office like the economy and the rout of the Islamic State. Advisers say privately that he has been distracted by the Mueller report, which he regards as a clear political victory, and has not focused on message for the coming months.As the campaign tries to build a traditional re-election operation, which officials often compare to President George W. Bush’s 2004 race, the tension may build between campaign officials and Mr. Trump, who trusts his gut above all else.“President Trump has always had his finger on the pulse of the nation and he understands what it is that the American people want, and that is why he won in 2016 and that has not changed,” said David Bossie, a former campaign adviser who, alongside the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, attended the rally with Mr. Trump on Thursday night. “He is his best political barometer.”Incumbent presidents running for re-election always come with built-in advantages: money, time, the stature of the office and the opportunity to define the terms of the race, while an inchoate field of opponents fight among one another.The Trump campaign is building an organization aimed at capitalizing on all of those advantages, crafting a conventional structure around a candidate whose nature is to buck against it. “There are lots of differences between being part of a bruising primary versus being the incumbent,” said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign communications director. “One of the differences is time. We have a big advantage on the Democrat field in that, and we intend to use it.”ImageA view of the Potomac River from the headquarters.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesBut the wild card is Mr. Trump himself.“It’s easy to build a beautiful operation,” said Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 race. “The message becomes the gas in the tank.”For now, the Trump campaign is focused on giving its candidate the infrastructure for success and, as the race is in its early stages, giving him the room he craves to dictate his own script.Mr. Trump is focused on vengeance after the end of the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his campaign aides are indulging him, attacking the Democrats who have sought to investigate him and the reporters who have written about it. Mr. Trump, whom critics have repeatedly described as “corrupt,” has tried to affix both terms to the news media.Privately, some Trump advisers acknowledge those attacks may have a shelf life, and that they are deploying them in part to blunt questions about Mr. Trump’s own credibility.But aides say that Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and without the Mueller investigation to swing at and no clear Democratic challenger likely to emerge for months, the press is his stand-in.ImageMaddison Stewart, left, and Christina Angel at the headquarters. To staff the campaign, advisers have brought in a mix of new hires and veterans of the 2016 effort.CreditJason Andrew for The New York TimesIn addition to the challenges posed by Mr. Trump’s preference for fights and distractions, the campaign faces headwinds that he did not as a first-time candidate. Democrats and Republicans see an electoral map that will be far more challenging for Mr. Trump, whose support in three key states has sagged, and who faced an invigorated and organic level of Democratic turnout.To staff the campaign, advisers have brought in a mix of new hires and veterans of the 2016 effort. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager who speaks frequently with the president, has consulted extensively with veterans of past presidential runs, relying increasingly on Karl Rove, the architect of Mr. Bush’s re-election effort.The polling team is expected to look similar to the one from 2016. It is likely to be led by Tony Fabrizio, a veteran Republican pollster who worked on Mr. Trump’s first race.

Maddow had 2.46 million viewers last week. It was her least-watched week of the year, and it represented the biggest gap between the two since last October.The big story last week was Attorney General William Barr's summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a positive development for supporters of President Donald Trump. Hannity's a big fan of Trump, of course, and featured a long interview with him on Wednesday's show.The last time he had a margin this big over Maddow was the week last October that Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh was approved for the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, Hannity slumped in the aftermath of the 2018 midterms, dominated by the Democrats. His average viewership for the month after the election was 1 million less than he had last week.Hannity's audience last week was up 24% from his average for the first three months of the year, Nielsen said. Other Fox News prime-time personalities did the same: Tucker Carlson was up 18% and Laura Ingraham up 25%.Maddow's audience was down 21% from what has been typical for her this year. The full MSNBC and CNN prime-time lineups slumped last week, with both Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo down 36% from the year's average, Nielsen said.CBS easily won the week in prime-time, averaging 6.6 million viewers. NBC had 4.7 million viewers, ABC had 4.4 million, Fox had 2.5 million, Univision had 1.4 million, ION Television had 1.3 million, Telemundo had 1.1 million and the CW had 770,000.TBS was the week's most popular cable network, courtesy of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, averaging 3.57 million viewers. Fox News Channel had 2.83 million, MSNBC had 1.49 million, HGTV had 1.23 million and History had 1.2 million.ABC's "World News Tonight" topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.1 million viewers. NBC's "Nightly News" had 7.7 million and the "CBS Evening News" had 5.4 million viewers.For the week of March 25-31, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: "60 Minutes," CBS, 12.59 million; "NCIS," CBS, 12.19 million; NCAA Men's Basketball Tourney: Purdue vs. Virginia, TBS, 10.49 million; NCAA Men's Basketball Tourney: Virginia Tech vs. Duke, CBS, 10.07 million; "FBI," CBS, 9.13 million; "The Voice," NBC, 9.01 million; "College Basketball Studio Show," TBS, 8.83 million; "Chicago Fire," NBC, 8.28 million; "God Friended Me," CBS, 8.16 million; "Survivor," CBS, 7.76 million.___ABC is owned by The Walt Disney Co.

His average viewership for the month after the election was 1 million less than he had last week.Hannity's audience last week was up 24% from his average for the first three months of the year, Nielsen said. Other Fox News prime-time personalities did the same: Tucker Carlson was up 18% and Laura Ingraham up 25%.Maddow's audience was down 21% from what has been typical for her this year. The full MSNBC and CNN prime-time lineups slumped last week, with both Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo down 36% from the year's average, Nielsen said.CBS easily won the week in prime-time, averaging 6.6 million viewers. NBC had 4.7 million viewers, ABC had 4.4 million, Fox had 2.5 million, Univision had 1.4 million, ION Television had 1.3 million, Telemundo had 1.1 million and the CW had 770,000.TBS was the week's most popular cable network, courtesy of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, averaging 3.57 million viewers. Fox News Channel had 2.83 million, MSNBC had 1.49 million, HGTV had 1.23 million and History had 1.2 million.ABC's "World News Tonight" topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.1 million viewers. NBC's "Nightly News" had 7.7 million and the "CBS Evening News" had 5.4 million viewers.For the week of March 25-31, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: "60 Minutes," CBS, 12.59 million; "NCIS," CBS, 12.19 million; NCAA Men's Basketball Tourney: Purdue vs. Virginia, TBS, 10.49 million; NCAA Men's Basketball Tourney: Virginia Tech vs. Duke, CBS, 10.07 million; "FBI," CBS, 9.13 million; "The Voice," NBC, 9.01 million; "College Basketball Studio Show," TBS, 8.83 million; "Chicago Fire," NBC, 8.28 million; "God Friended Me," CBS, 8.16 million; "Survivor," CBS, 7.76 million.___ABC is owned by The Walt Disney Co.

Sign up to get it by email and tell us what you think: nytaustralia@nytimes.com.___In 2015, Al-Jazeera’s Investigative Unit had a question: what did the National Rifle Association say about mass shootings behind closed doors?To answer it, they planned a lengthy undercover investigation, in which a reporter posed as an Australian gun lobbyist to infiltrate meetings with the NRA and with One Nation, a far-right, anti-immigration party.The result, released in a two part documentary that aired on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is — at the very least — compelling.In hidden camera footage shot during a trip to the United States last year, senior figures from One Nation are heard discussing the influence a donation from the American gun lobby could buy in the Australia’s parliament. The cameras also captured advice from the NRA on how to respond to mass shootings and sway public opinion toward gun ownership.Australia has some of the toughest gun laws in the world, and the country is proud of it. So news that a political party’s officials were willing to soften the rules for foreign donations were met with alarm.Since then, Pauline Hanson, the party’s leader, has said the comments were taken out of context — she called Al-Jazeera an “Islamist” organization and a “Middle Eastern foreign agent.” But she also attacked the report’s ethics, calling it an “illegal, covert operation.”Was she at least a little bit right?There are of course many well-known accounts of undercover journalism and like many people, I’ve read them with interest, from Gloria Steinem’s infiltration of Playboy Clubs to Shane Bauer’s stint as an American prison guard.It’s one solution to a challenge all reporters think about: How do you get the information you need from those who don’t want to share?I spoke to two professors about Al-Jazeera’s report, and also asked The New York Times’s standards editor, Phil Corbett, for his views.Phil made clear that according to the Times ethics guide, staff members “should disclose their identity to people they cover” and “may not record conversations without the prior consent of all parties to the conversations.”Exceptions involving sustained deception have been extremely rare, he said.“Overall, we think, this is the best way to insure both fairness to our subjects and credibility with our readers.”That being said, he added, “we recognize that other news organizations have sometimes taken different approaches, and there is a long history of undercover reporting that unearthed important information.”The two professors I interviewed both argued that the story’s main discovery — that an Australian political party was aligning themselves with a controversial lobby group to potentially change policy — was clearly in the public interest.But they also agreed that there were two key areas that raise questions and concerns: The use of hidden cameras and the fact that an undercover reporter became a part of the story.One justification is that the documentary was transparent about its methods, said Andrew Dodd, director for the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne.“The audience is fully aware of the artifice that was created,” he said. “The audience is therefore able to make an informed decision about what they’re watching.”But to go undercover for so long on this scale is not considered normal reporting “in any way, shape or form,” he added. “This should be a last resort. This has to remain extraordinary journalism that is practiced rarely and only for the very best reasons.”That reason would be to bring truths to the public that would not ever reach them otherwise, he said.He pointed to one moment in the documentary when the NRA discusses their social media strategy after shootings. “You see a glimpse of truth in that moment that you couldn’t get in a two hour debate,” he said.But Peter Greste, a former journalist for Al-Jazeera, now a professor at the University of Queensland, said the story crossed a line in having a reporter broker the meeting between the One Nation party and the NRA.“We are supposed to be observers to the news, not participants,” he said. “It’s inappropriate for journalists to become parts of the story the way they clearly did in this case.”While the findings are “distasteful,” the party was not doing anything illegal, he added.What also raises concerns is the party’s decision to refer Al-Jazeera to the federal police force and Australia’s national security agency, which Mr. Greste called a “dangerous precedent” — the consequences of which he is intimately familiar with.While working for Al-Jazeera in Cairo in 2013, Mr. Greste was arrested and detained by the Egyptian government for terrorism offences. “What happened to us in Egypt was the government using national security to effectively silence the press.”Given the cynicism toward journalism these days, he said, upholding the role of the impartial watchdog to gain public trust is more important than ever: “When you let ethical standards slip then I think we do damage to that support.”So where do you stand on this?

By Melina DelkicApril 1, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Britain’s Parliament looks for more Brexit alternatives, President Trump threatens to close part of the U.S. border, and Slovakia elects its first female president. Here’s the latest:ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain speaking to lawmakers on Friday.CreditMark Duffy/House of Commons, via Associated PressBrexit puts British democracy on trialLate Monday in Britain, lawmakers will try again to come up with an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which they have rejected three times.Chances of success appear minimal. None of the eight options on the table last week fetched a majority in Parliament.Failure would leave the country with two unappealing options: leave the E.U. in a little over a week without a deal or delay Brexit further.Analysis: “In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise,” our London correspondents Ellen Barry and Benjamin Mueller write. “No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful.“It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.”The winners: One industry that seems to be booming amid the Brexit chaos: law firms dealing with client concerns about the legal ramifications of the divorce with the E.U. Live from our London newsroom: What does this divided moment mean for the future of Britain? Times subscribers can join a conference call at 2 p.m. G.M.T. for a discussion of Brexit with our Europe editor, Jim Yardley; the London-based chief international correspondent Ellen Barry; and the London correspondent Stephen Castle. R.S.V.P. here. ImagePresident Trump at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Sunday.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesPresident Trump shifts focus back to immigrationThe president, emboldened by his attorney general’s public characterization of the Mueller report, has threatened to close off parts of the U.S. border with Mexico this week. He also ordered the State Department to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, saying the countries were not doing enough to stop migrants from pushing north.In recent weeks, Border Patrol facilities have been strained by an influx of migrants — the largest annual surge in years — ahead of the arrival of the deadly summer heat.Impact: Sealing the border would effectively close off the U.S. from one of its largest trading partners, and could leave American citizens who travel back and forth stuck in limbo.Conditions: Processing stations across the 1,900-mile border with Mexico were not expanded despite projections of the influx, and makeshift additions have been overwhelmed. American immigration officials cleared out a holding pen under a bridge in El Paso, Tex., after an outcry over conditions at the site. ImageNew recruits for the Central African Armed Forces, pictured in August, are trained in the handling of weapons by Russian consultants.CreditFlorent Vergnes/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesRussia’s military mission sets sights on AfricaRussia has been steadily expanding its military influence across Africa, alarming Western officials by increasing arms sales, security agreements and training programs for unstable countries or autocratic leaders.The effort reflects President Vladimir Putin’s vision of returning Russia to its former glory and illustrates the country’s opportunistic strategy.What Russia wants: The country is seeking more strategic bases for its troops, according to an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a research organization in Washington.Scope: Russia is helping a former general in Libya fight for control over his government and vast oil market. Sudan’s president brought in Russian mercenaries in January to help shore up his rule against protests. Last spring, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania appealed to Moscow to help their overtaxed militaries and security services combat terrorism.History: Russia was entrenched in Africa during the Cold War’s violent East-West rivalry but largely retreated from the continent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the past two years, however, Moscow has rekindled relations.Others in Africa: American political consultants with ties to President Trump have become regular fixtures in African political campaigns, seizing on the region’s turn toward democracy.Spotlight: India’s electionsImageSupporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party wearing masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.CreditAnuwar Hazarika/ReutersWith about 900 million voters, almost 2,000 registered parties and five weeks of voting, the Indian elections can seem cacophonous. Even for this briefing writer, a diaspora Indian, they’re difficult to follow. The country’s myriad states, cultures and socioeconomic segments can’t be sliced into left or right, red or blue. It’s a kaleidoscope, and each prism illuminates a different aspect of the political spectrum.But it is also heartening to watch this young democracy exercising a right denied to many in the surrounding region. And it is important: What happens in India can end up shifting the global economy and geopolitical landscape.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are seeking to retain power, facing a surging challenge by the opposition Congress Party. The briefing will be regularly unpacking aspects of the race. Voting unfolds from April 11 until May 19 and results are announced on May 23.Keep in mind that the backdrop for the campaigning is a flammable mix of economic, religious and national security issues. Unemployment is high, sectarian violence has risen, farmers across the country are increasingly frustrated and there’s broad disillusionment with politicians.Send us your feedback and any questions you have about the elections here.— Alisha Haridasani Gupta Here’s what else is happeningAlgeria: The army chief kept his post in a newly named government despite his call to have the ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, declared unfit for office. Critics accused the army chief of trying to orchestrate a coup. On Friday, tens of thousands of Algerians marched in a broad show of anger against the government in the sixth mass protest in a row.Italy: The country’s interior minister, part of the anti-immigrant League party, criticized an Italian rap tune with a Middle Eastern flavor. Now the song’s artist is at the center of a national debate about what it means to be Italian at a time when critics say the country’s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia.Uber: A college student in South Carolina was found dead after she apparently got into a car that she mistook for an Uber she had called, the authorities said. In a statement, the president of her university said, “Times like these leave me searching for words of wisdom and comfort.”Women as leaders: In Opinion, Tina Brown writes about women who shine as leaders when they stop pursuing male paths to power, and instead lead like women: “Women have learned and taught lessons about how to cope with seeming impossibilities in ways that men traditionally — and to this day — have not.” ImagePeople gathering around Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” on display at Christie’s auction rooms in London in 2017.CreditKirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press“Salvator Mundi”: The location of the famed painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci has been a mystery since last year, shortly after a Saudi royal, most likely the crown prince, paid $450 million for it.The Kardashians: For more than a decade, the family has turned its feuding on reality TV into business opportunities. “People don’t know how much work goes into it,” the family matriarch, Kris Jenner, said in an interview with The Times.Slovakia: Zuzana Caputova was elected as the country’s first female president, and the 45-year-old lawyer, activist and political newcomer vowed to return a sense of decency to Slovakia’s often toxic political climate.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Another attempt in Parliament to control the Brexit process, a special look at Indian elections and a global search for “Salvator Mundi.” Here’s the latest:ImagePro-Brexit protesters outside Parliament on Friday.CreditHannah Mckay/ReutersBrexit puts British democracy on trialLate Monday in Britain, lawmakers will try again to come up with an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which they have now rejected three times.Chances of success appear minimal. None of the eight options that were on the table last week managed to fetch a majority in Parliament, and fewer are likely to be considered in this round.Failure would leave the country with two unappealing options: leave the E.U. in a little over a week without a deal or delay Brexit further.Analysis: “In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise,” our London correspondents Ellen Barry and Benjamin Mueller write. “No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful.“It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.”The winners: One industry that seems to be booming amid the Brexit chaos: law firms dealing with client concerns about the legal ramifications of the divorce with the E.U. ImageCars lined up to cross the U.S.-Mexico border at the San Ysidro port of entry, one of the world’s busiest land crossings.CreditMario Tama/Getty ImagesPresident Trump shifts focus back to immigrationThe president, emboldened by his attorney general’s public characterization of the Mueller report, has threatened to close off parts of the U.S. border with Mexico this week. He also ordered the State Department to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, saying the three countries were not doing enough to stop migrants from pushing north.In recent weeks, Border Patrol facilities have been strained by an influx of migrants — the largest annual surge in years — ahead of the arrival of the deadly summer heat.Impact: Sealing the border would effectively close off the U.S. from one of its largest trading partners, and could leave American citizens who travel back and forth stuck in limbo.Conditions: Processing stations across the 1,900-mile border with Mexico were not expanded despite projections of the influx, and makeshift additions have been overwhelmed.One camp under a bridge in El Paso, Tex., which one volunteer described as resembling a “concentration camp,” was cleared out following an outcry over conditions there.ImagePrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia meeting with Facebook executives last week after the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand.CreditDarren England/EPA, via ShutterstockAustralia and New Zealand consider new social media rulesIn the aftermath of the live-streamed massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, lawmakers in both countries are considering sweeping new policies that would restrict the kind of content permitted on social media platforms.If the two countries move ahead, their regulations could serve as models for the rest of the world amid growing frustration and anger with Silicon Valley giants.But the efforts walk a fine line between intervention and censorship. For established democracies that cherish free speech, China’s sophisticated system of suppressing online content could be seen as a cautionary tale.Over the weekend: Social media companies are themselves beginning to converge around the need for new rules. Mark Zuckerberg invited Congress to regulate Facebook and other social media networks in an opinion piece for The Washington Post. He suggested they focus on harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.Spotlight: India’s electionsImageSupporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party wearing masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.CreditAnuwar Hazarika/ReutersWith around 900 million voters, almost 2,000 registered parties and five weeks of voting, the Indian elections can seem cacophonous. Even for your briefing writer, a diaspora Indian, they’re difficult to follow. The country’s myriad states, cultures and socioeconomic segments can’t be sliced into left or right, red or blue. It’s a kaleidoscope, and each prism illuminates a different aspect of the political spectrum.But it is also heartening to watch this young democracy exercising a right denied to many in the surrounding region. And it is important: What happens in India can end up shifting the global economy and geopolitical landscape.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are seeking to retain power, facing a surging challenge by the opposition Congress Party. The briefing will be regularly unpacking aspects of the race. Voting unfolds from from April 11 until May 19 and results are announced on May 23.For now, keep in mind that the backdrop for the campaigning is a flammable mix of economic, religious and national security issues. Unemployment is high, sectarian violence has risen, farmers across the country are increasingly frustrated and there’s a broad disillusionment with politicians.Send us your feedback and any questions you have about the elections here.Here’s what else is happeningTaiwan: Two Chinese fighter jets crossed the self-ruled island’s maritime border, a move Taiwanese officials condemned as “provocative,” saying it “seriously impacted regional safety and stability.”Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder’s security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Mr. Bezos’ phone, motivated by the aggressive coverage in The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos also owns, of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The consultant provided no evidence but said he had turned his findings over to law enforcement.Boeing 737: Black box data from the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight suggests that a faulty sensor that erroneously activated an automated stabilizing system on the jet caused the crash, a sequence also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October.Joe Biden: The former vice president, accused of touching and kissing a Nevada candidate just before appearing in support of her political campaign in 2014, released a statement saying he didn’t believe he acted inappropriately but admitted to making “expressions of affection” on the campaign trail. He is expected to announce whether he will run for president soon.Arctic drilling: A U.S. federal judge ruled that President Trump’s executive order to lift an Obama-era ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean was unlawful, keeping the drilling ban in “full force” and hindering Mr. Trump’s efforts to undo his predecessor’s environmental legacy.North Korea: The country said that a mysterious raid of its embassy in Madrid last month, led by a Mexican man who lives in the U.S., was a “grave terrorist attack” and a “flagrant violation of international law.”Afghanistan: The country’s vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, survived the latest in a series of Taliban attacks. The insurgent group’s list of grievances against the former warlord leads with the deaths of thousands of Taliban prisoners who surrendered to his forces in late 2001, many of whom suffocated in sealed trucks en route to prison.ImageLast fall’s scheduled unveiling of “Salvator Mundi” at the Louvre Abu Dhabi was canceled without explanation.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty Images North America“Salvator Mundi”: The location of the famed painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci has been a mystery since last year, shortly after a Saudi royal, most likely the crown prince, paid $450 million for it.The Kardashians: For more than a decade, the family has turned its feuding on reality TV into business opportunities. “People don’t know how much work goes into it,” the family matriarch, Kris Jenner, said in an interview with The Times.111 years young: Two British men, Alfred Smith and Bob Weighton, have lived through two world wars, more than 20 prime ministers and the entire rule of Queen Elizabeth II.

By David LeonhardtOpinion ColumnistMarch 28, 2019ImageA pro-European Union protester in London on Wednesday, the day Parliament held a series of votes on the future of Brexit.CreditCreditAndy Rain/EPA, via ShutterstockThis article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.I’m a fan of ranked-choice voting. I think it’s a fairer way to decide elections than the more common method, in which each person can vote for only a first choice. The 2000 presidential election highlighted the problem with this first-choice system. That year, more Floridians preferred Al Gore to George W. Bush. But Bush won, because some of the people who preferred Gore to Bush voted for Ralph Nader as their first choice. In ranked-choice voting, people can list multiple candidates, in order of preference. If your first choice isn’t among the top two vote-getters, your later choices start to matter. And the method has been catching on in recent years. Australia, Britain, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand all use it for some elections. The state of Maine has also started using it, and a congressional race last year turned on voters’ second choices. Now there is another way in which ranked choice could be useful: Solving the Brexit mess.Brexit is at a standstill because none of the options has the support of a majority of Parliament (or, it seems, of the British people). Yesterday, Parliament voted on eight different proposals under which Britain could leave the European Union. None got a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May has even offered to resign if Parliament passes her plan, knowing that would appeal to many members of Parliament. In previous votes, the May plan hasn’t come close to passing.So some observers have begun calling for a ranked-choice solution. In effect, it would winnow down the options to the two most popular and then force Parliament to choose between them. “The great virtue of this voting system,” Partha Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, writes in The Financial Times, “is that it results in an outcome that is truly the majority winner.” Part of the idea, as Ian Dunt, the editor of politics.co.uk, has written, is “creating a process where tolerable compromises can be found.”Notably, one of the only proposals that came closest to passing yesterday was a kind of meta option, calling for the British people to get an up-or-down vote on any plan Parliament ultimately passed. It’s a sign of how far Parliament remains from agreeing on the substance of Brexit.I’ll confess to being torn about my hopes here. On the one hand, I think ranked-choice voting is a fair way for Parliament to find the most acceptable version of Brexit. On the other, I wouldn’t mind if Parliament were to find any acceptable version and then put the entire matter before the British public for a re-vote.Related: On the latest episode of “The Argument” podcast, Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I talk about how to replace the Electoral College, and one option is a national popular vote with ranked choice. We also debate the meaning of the Mueller investigation — and who should be feeling vindicated by it.College diversity, on filmFor anyone interested in economic diversity in higher education — as I am — I recommend a new film that follows three high school students in Brooklyn as they try to navigate the application process. It’s called “Personal Statement” and is directed by Juliane Dressner. It’s available for renting on Amazon or iTunes. The film feels particularly timely in the wake of the college admissions scandal. The experiences of the three students in “Personal Statement” are much closer to the American norm than the elite world of, say, the Georgetown tennis team.One of the film’s students, Enoch Jemmott, who’s now a senior at Queens College, has an Op-Ed in The Times this morning. In it, he describes the hurdles that lower-income students face, from the lack of a single college counselor at many high schools to the byzantine misery of financial aid forms.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|U.S. House Committee Seeks Trump Tax Returns From IRSAdvertisementSupported byU.S. House Committee Seeks Trump Tax Returns From IRSBy ReutersApril 3, 2019WASHINGTON — The Democratic head of a powerful U.S. House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns on Wednesday, in a long-awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House.The request, in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump's income taxes and business network, which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations."It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials. To maintain trust in our democracy, the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly, as laws intend," Neal said in a statement.IRS and U.S. Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment.Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president, saying his returns were "under audit" by the IRS. Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties. Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U.S. military leaders on Wednesday. "Is that all?" the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns. "Usually it's 10, so I guess they're giving up," he said. "I've been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name, you're audited. But until such time as I'm not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that." Neal based his request on his committee's oversight jurisdiction of the IRS, specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president. OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal's effort, saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U.S. citizen into a political weapon."This particular request is an abuse of the tax-writing committees' statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of ... the Internal Revenue Code,” Representative Kevin Brady, the committee's top Republican, said in a statement.Independent analysts welcomed the move. "The Ways and Means Committee's strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly," said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington. It was the third time this week a Democratic-led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump. Earlier on Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full investigation report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election.The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday.Neal's committee initially planned to request only Trump's personal tax returns. But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president's activity in the private sector. The request includes returns for eight entities: Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC, DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp, LFB Acquisition Member Corp, LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club.A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump's business activity. Although Trump has never released his returns, the New York Times last year cited a "vast trove" of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes. The White House called the report misleading.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|House Intelligence Committee Seeks Documents From Trump’s InauguralAdvertisementSupported byHouse Intelligence Committee Seeks Documents From Trump’s InauguralImageStephanie Winston Wolkoff, who played a leading role in planning President Trump’s inaugural, received a request for documents from the House Intelligence Committee.CreditCreditRebecca Smeyne for The New York TimesBy Maggie Haberman and Ben ProtessApril 3, 2019The House Intelligence Committee has asked one of the top contractors to President Trump’s inaugural to provide it with documents about the event, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday, opening up a new line of inquiry into the planning and financing of the ceremonies.The committee asked for documents from and an interview with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who had been a close friend of the first lady, Melania Trump, and who had helped plan the celebrations and parties around the inaugural, the person said. The request was disclosed by a lawyer for Ms. Winston Wolkoff in a letter this week to the inaugural committee.It is unclear what was requested, or why the intelligence committee is now involved. But it adds a new layer to the existing federal investigations into the inaugural committee, which was run by Thomas J. Barrack, a close friend of the president, with help from some former Trump political aides. They include Rick Gates, who previously pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and who has been cooperating with various investigations for more than a year.In February, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the inaugural committee demanding that it turn over documents about donors, finances and activities. The subpoena sought documents related to all of the committee’s donors and guests; any benefits handed out, including tickets and photo opportunities with the president; federal disclosure filings; vendors and contracts.Among other issues, federal prosecutors have been investigating whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee and a pro-Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy, according to people familiar with the inquiry.The inquiry has been looking at whether people from Middle Eastern nations — including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds.A spokesman for the intelligence committee, Patrick Boland, declined to comment on the request it made for documents from Ms. Winston Wolkoff. Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee, has said that the panel would investigate any “financial or other leverage” that “foreign actors” might have over Mr. Trump and his administration.The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.A lawyer for Ms. Winston Wolkoff declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported the request from the intelligence committee on Wednesday.Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been investigating donors to and spending by the inaugural committee since last year.Their investigation was prompted by a recording between Ms. Winston Wolkoff and Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer and fixer, that the prosecutors found on Mr. Cohen’s cellphone. In a separate case brought by those prosecutors, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump.Ms. Winston Wolkoff has been cooperating with that probe since last fall, earlier than inaugural officials knew, according to the letter from her lawyer.A sealed court order prohibited Ms. Winston Wolkoff from disclosing the fact that she received a subpoena from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan. That order, which lasted for 180 days, recently expired, a person briefed on the letter from her lawyer said.Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn, have also been looking into questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee. They have been examining Mr. Barrack’s ties to the Middle East, among other matters, according to the people briefed on the work.The inaugural committee raised $107 million and spent more freely than those of previous presidents. In 72 days, it spent about $100 million, roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations.Ms. Winston Wolkoff, with a partner, set up a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Intelligence Panel Is Opening

But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state.While Republicans were excited, they were also cautious about what Hagedorn's showing means for President Donald Trump's re-election."Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else," Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said. "This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end. 2020 is an entirely different, politically charged animal with the presidential race."Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election, credited Hagedorn's showing with a ground-up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities."This is the recipe for success," he said. "That's what I've been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election. We have to energize, rely on the grassroots."Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of $1.2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee. Conservative talk radio, including former Republican Gov. Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election, also worked to drive up turnout.Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame-duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race, GOP strategists said.Hagedorn said attacks against him over long-ago blog writings, including calling Planned Parenthood a "wicked organization" and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights, motivated his supporters.Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins, including ousting Walker in November, nothing can be taken for granted."Not that Democrats needed it, but it's another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive," said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki. "This is not a red state. This is not a blue state. This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum."Neubauer didn't immediately say whether she would request a recount, which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense. She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount. Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals, and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount.The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years, and is itself clearly partisan — conservatives hold a 4-3 edge. Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice, maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year.Unless Hagedorn's apparent victory is undone by recount, conservatives instead will enjoy a 5-2 majority and won't be at risk of losing it until at least 2023. The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature.Turnout was nearly 27%, well above the 22% of last year's state Supreme Court race. Hagedorn overcame Neubauer's huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin. Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump's win in 2016.Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein's expense. In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots, only 131 votes were changed — in favor of Trump. Neubauer, in a recount of just 1.2 million ballots, would have to pick up 45 times as many votes.The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks $2 million — more than the $1.7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18. However, those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2.9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College.Given the recent tight elections, Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020, Johnson said."We have to run almost perfect elections going forward," he said "If (Democrats) are energized, we're going to have issues. Nobody will be overconfident. We know what's at stake."______Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee, Wisconsin.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsPart 3: The Future of Fox: An Even More Powerful Political Weapon - The New York Times

The Disney deal left the Murdochs with a media empire stripped to its essence: a hard-core right-wing news machine — with Lachlan in charge.
By JONATHAN MAHLER and JIM RUTENBERG APRIL 3, 2019
This is Part 3 of a three-part story. Go back and read Part 1 and Part 2.
14. ‘You’ll be hearing from me’
It was in the midst of this moment — the biggest deal of his career — that the 86-year-old Murdoch tripped on his way to the bathroom on Lachlan’s yacht and had to be transported to Los Angeles. With their father laid up at the Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center at the start of 2018, Murdoch’s children descended on Los Angeles, unsure if this would be the end. Lachlan and his wife, Sarah, met them at the hospital. Elisabeth and her husband, Keith Tyson, came from London, James and Kathryn from New York. Murdoch’s surgery was successful. Not long after his children arrived, his condition stabilized. Following his near-death experience, Murdoch joked that he did not realize how serious his condition was until he had seen all his children gathered around his hospital bed.

Murdoch would be laid up for the next few months but still in command, running things from his bedroom at Moraga. In an email to his senior management leaked to Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman, he described the incident as “a sailing accident” and said that he would be working at home for a little while. “In the meantime,” Murdoch wrote, “you’ll be hearing from me by email, phone and text!”

The negotiations continued. As they did, Lachlan and James adjusted to their new realities. Unable to secure a job at Disney that he wanted, and wary of its aggressively safe and hierarchical culture, James decided in the winter that he would not try to follow the family’s assets to their new home, according to three people who are close to him. Lachlan would take over what was left of the Murdoch empire without interference from his brother.
In early June 2018, before the final terms were settled, another bidder emerged. Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, offered Murdoch $65 billion for 21st Century Fox, $12.6 billion more than Disney was prepared to pay. Murdoch didn’t want to sell to Comcast, according to three people familiar with his thinking. He preferred Disney for a variety of reasons, including his personal admiration for Iger, whom he viewed as a risk-taking leader in his own image. What’s more, the Comcast offer was all cash, which would create a big tax burden for Murdoch. But Murdoch did like the prospect of a bidding war. And he had a potential path to securing both a higher price and his preferred buyer in the Justice Department’s ongoing lawsuit to block a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.
Comcast’s interest in 21st Century Fox allowed Murdoch to drive up Disney’s purchase price to $71.3 billion. Iger and his team delivered what they hoped would be their final offer personally to Murdoch in London, traveling through Ireland because they were worried that Comcast might be tracking the movement of private planes flying in and out of London from the United States. Murdoch had Disney on the hook.
His back now healed, Murdoch attended the Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, in July 2018. With Roberts and Iger nearby, he seemed exhilarated; once again, he was in the middle of the action. The problem for Murdoch was that if Comcast made another counteroffer, he might have a fiduciary responsibility to present the offer to his board, and it might accept it, absent extenuating circumstances. He didn’t want his stalking horse to overtake his favorite.
[Read 6 takeaways from this story.]
The Trump Justice Department came to Murdoch’s rescue, appealing a federal court ruling in the AT&T and Time Warner case. On its face, the lawsuit had nothing to do with Comcast, but because the company had its own history of tangles with government regulators, the appeal would give Murdoch the cover he needed to accept Iger’s latest bid: Comcast now looked risky. There is no evidence that the Justice Department factored Murdoch’s interests into its decision-making process; nevertheless, he had gotten another $20 billion for his company while still selling to his preferred suitor.
When the deal was finalized, Murdoch would personally make roughly $4 billion, bringing his net worth to $18 billion. All six of his children would receive $2 billion each. Lachlan and James would get even more — an additional $20 million in Disney stock, plus golden parachutes worth about $70 million each. Yet neither one was getting what he had really wanted.
15. ‘A deal that’s not good for the country’
Media empires are built on the foresight and audacity of their leaders, their ability to anticipate and embrace sudden changes in an industry that’s constantly evolving. But they are also built on something far more mundane: government regulations. More than anything, it’s the moving of lines, the lifting of caps and the rewriting of rules that enable moguls to transform businesses into empires. These decisions are invariably opaque, the product of a labyrinthine bureaucratic process and the inherently subjective definition of what’s in the public interest. Under President Trump, these decisions have almost always broken Murdoch’s way.
The Time Warner-AT&T deal was itself a good example of the ambiguities of this bureaucratic process. It worked out perfectly for Murdoch, but Trump had his own reason to try to block the acquisition: Time Warner was the owner of CNN, with which he was constantly feuding. He called it a “a deal that’s not good for the country,” and privately urged his chief economics adviser, Gary Cohn, to stop it, according to two people who were told about the conversation. (The exchange was first reported in The New Yorker.) Deals like this, a “vertical merger” between two companies in separate businesses, rarely face antitrust scrutiny. And yet Trump’s Department of Justice sued to prevent it, the first time the federal government had taken such a step in 40 years. The Justice Department antitrust enforcer who filed the government’s lawsuit against the deal, Makan Delrahim, was in fact on record saying earlier that he didn’t see it “as a major antitrust problem.” And yet when a federal judge, Richard Leon, dismissed the Justice Department’s case, calling one of its key arguments “gossamer thin,” the government appealed, and just in time to stave off Comcast’s next bid for 21st Century Fox. The process had dragged on for more than two years.

The speed with which Murdoch’s Disney deal was approved stood in stark contrast. This type of agreement — a “horizontal merger” bringing together Hollywood’s largest and third-largest studios — would give the combined company near-monopoly power to raise consumers’ prices and limit their choices. Such deals ordinarily invite strict government scrutiny. The Department of Justice approved it in just six months. (Fox executives credit the company’s thorough preparations for its speedy and successful review.) After calling Murdoch to ensure that the deal wouldn’t affect Fox News, Trump had applauded it: “This could be a great thing for jobs,” his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said when asked to characterize the president’s reaction to the agreement. Wall Street analysts predicted that the deal would result in thousands of layoffs.
The ambiguities of the regulatory process were also evident in another deal with major implications for Murdoch’s empire. In the spring of 2017, months before Murdoch started negotiating with Iger, the Sinclair Broadcast Group agreed to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. Sinclair was already the largest owner of local TV stations in the country. It was also overwhelmingly pro-Trump: Its local stations, many of which were in key swing states, provided Trump with positive coverage during the campaign — a result, in part, of a deal that Kushner had personally struck with Sinclair’s chairman, David Smith. Murdoch had been concerned about the company’s steady growth. With Sinclair’s acquisition of Tribune, which was already in 39 percent of American households, the company would now be in more than 70 percent. What’s more, Tribune owned WGN, an unremarkable cable channel with unexploited potential: It reached nearly 80 million homes and could easily be converted into a right-wing national news network — an instant competitor to Fox News. In conversations with colleagues, Murdoch worried that Sinclair might hire O’Reilly as the marquee star of the new Fox rival.
Sinclair seemed to have a friend and ally not just in Trump but also in the Federal Communications Commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai. Days after the election, when he was still just a commissioner at the agency, he appeared at a Sinclair executive retreat at the Four Seasons in Baltimore, according to a Politico story. After he became chairman in 2017, he effectively enabled Sinclair’s bid for the Tribune stations, easing limits on how many stations a single company could own. There was enough suspicion that Pai might be inclined to give Sinclair favorable treatment that the F.C.C.’s inspector general started an investigation into the commissioner’s relationship with the company. But then, in the summer of 2018, Pai basically blocked the deal, announcing that he had “serious concerns” about it. Sinclair officials said they were “shocked.”
Once again, things had broken Murdoch’s way. The report cleared Pai of inappropriate conduct — either to help or hurt Sinclair — though it left some questions unanswered about Fox, like what Pai and Jared Kushner discussed during a conversation just before the deal was announced. Pai was asked if anyone from Fox News had tried to influence the ruling. He “responded in the negative,” the investigators wrote.
16. ‘Do you think Malcolm is going to survive?’
In the middle of August 2018, Lachlan Murdoch emerged from his Gulfstream G550 in a T-shirt and jeans and climbed into a black Range Rover waiting for him on the tarmac. Australian paparazzi were waiting there, too, as they often were when Lachlan or his father arrived in Sydney. This time, they were both in town: Murdoch had landed two days earlier. They went for a company awards dinner, but they had another agenda as well.
The night after his arrival, Lachlan invited a small group of Sky employees and managers to his $16 million mansion in Sydney for drinks. With its new prime-time lineup of hard-right opinion hosts, Sky had become a force in Australian politics. Its audience was still small by American standards, but it was the network of choice in the capital, Canberra, and it was finalizing a deal to expand its reach into the Australian Outback — demographically speaking, the equivalent of Trump country.

It was a mirror of Fox News, with its fixation on race, identity and climate-change denial. Night after night, Sky’s hosts and their guests stirred anger over the perceived liberal bias of the media, “suicidal self-hatred” of Western civilization and the Australian equivalent of the Central American “caravans” that were dividing the United States: asylum seekers coming to the country by boat from Indonesia and Malaysia, many of them Muslim. Days before Lachlan’s arrival, a national neo-Nazi leader, Blair Cottrell — who had recently been fined for “inciting contempt for Muslims” — appeared on one of the network’s shows. Cottrell had been interviewed on Australian TV before, but his deferential treatment by Sky caused a national outcry. Under gentle questioning, he called on his countrymen to “reclaim our traditional identity as Australians” and advocated limiting immigration to those “who are not too culturally dissimilar from us,” such as white South African farmers. (Sky apologized and suspended the program.)
Inside Lachlan’s living room, the talk turned to national politics. “Do you think Malcolm is going to survive?” Lachlan asked his staff. Malcolm was Malcolm Turnbull, the relatively moderate Australian prime minister who took office a few years earlier. Inside the government, a small right-wing uprising had been brewing over his plans to bring Australia into compliance with the Paris climate accord. It is well established among those who have worked for the Murdochs that the family rarely, if ever, issues specific directives. They convey their desires indirectly, maybe with a tweet — as Murdoch did in the spring of 2016 when he decided to back Trump — or a question, the subtleties of which are rarely lost on their like-minded news executives.
In the days that followed, Sky Australia’s hosts and the Murdoch papers — the newspaper editors had their own drinks session at Lachlan’s mansion — set about trying to throw Turnbull out of office. Alan Jones, a Sky host and conservative radio star, called for a party “rebellion” against him on his program. Days later, the Murdochs’ major paper in Sydney, The Daily Telegraph, broke the news that a leadership challenge was in the works. Cheering on the challenge, Andrew Bolt, the Murdoch columnist who was once convicted of violating the country’s Racial Discrimination Act, told his Sky viewers that Turnbull’s “credibility is shot, his authority is gone.” Peta Credlin, the commentator who was Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff, chewed out a member of Parliament for the chaos inside Turnbull’s administration. The Australian, the Murdochs’ national newspaper, was soon declaring Turnbull a “dead man walking.”
Word got back to Turnbull about Lachlan’s remark to his staff. He knew that Sky After Dark had been becoming increasingly critical of him: Months earlier, an aide showed him a video montage of promotional clips from the network questioning his leadership of the country. “Is it always like this?” the aide recalled him asking. But he now believed that this tough coverage was part of a concerted campaign. One of his senior aides confronted the Murdochs’ Australian executives in a text that was shared with us. The Turnbull camp knew, it said, that “Lachlan had made it clear at the editors drinks on Tuesday night that he would like MT to get rolled.”
Turnbull heard, too, that Rupert Murdoch was miffed at him because he had not reached out to him since he landed in the country, according to three former officials in Turnbull’s government. Turnbull’s chief of staff had been trying to set up a meeting with Murdoch; he now redoubled his efforts. Turnbull settled for a phone call, pleading with Murdoch to back off. “Let me have a look at it, and let me talk to Lachlan,” Murdoch said. “I’m retired. I’ll talk to Lachlan.” (Through a spokesman, Murdoch denied that he felt slighted by Turnbull.)
Two days later, Turnbull’s right-wing opponents ousted him through a definitive intraparty vote, known in Australian politics as a leadership “spill.” Chaos ensued, creating round-the-clock political theater for Sky Australia, which logged its highest ratings in the network’s history. (The Murdochs have denied any role in the ouster.)
It was always difficult to separate the personal from the financial and the ideological with the Murdochs. All appeared to be in evidence in their decision to turn against Turnbull. To begin with, he took office a few years earlier by ousting Lachlan’s friend Tony Abbott, and it was Abbott who helped lead the Turnbull uprising. Turnbull’s policies were also not perfectly aligned with the Murdochs’ interests. For instance, he had expedited the construction of the country’s national broadband network, which directly threatened the family’s highly profitable cable business by giving Netflix a government-subsidized pipeline into Australian homes.
The small number of Australian media outlets that the Murdochs did not own portrayed Turnbull’s ouster as a Murdoch-led “coup.” Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister whom the family had helped push out of office years earlier, described Murdoch in an op-ed in The Sydney Morning Herald as “the greatest cancer on the Australian democracy.”
Turnbull was replaced by the right-wing nationalist Scott Morrison, who quickly aligned himself with Trump. The two met in person for the first time in late 2018 at the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires. “I think it’s going to be a great relationship,” Trump said afterward. With a national election scheduled for May 2019, Morrison quickly staked his party’s prospects on the polarizing issue of immigration, promising a new hard-line approach. It dovetailed with Sky’s regular prime-time programming. Andrew Bolt, who previously warned of a “foreign invasion,” said in one segment, “We also risk importing ethnic and religious strife, even terrorism,” as the screen flashed an image of Australia’s potential future: rows of Muslims on a city street, bowing toward Mecca. When the opposing Labor Party managed to muscle through legislation that would allow doctors to transfer severely sick migrants in detention centers on the islands of Nauru and Manus into hospitals in Australia, Sky Australia’s prime-time hosts went on the offensive.
17. ‘No, I’m not embarrassed’
The third generation of the Murdoch dynasty was finally taking control. The Disney deal was still pending regulatory approval in a few countries — the two companies had overlapping operations in China, Mexico, Brazil and elsewhere — but Lachlan was already shifting to his new role as chairman and chief executive of the new Fox. The empire was much smaller, but in political terms, at least, it was no less powerful, and its direction was clear.
Lachlan generally avoids on-the-record interviews, but now that he was taking ownership of the family business, it seemed appropriate to make at least one public appearance. He chose the New York Times-sponsored DealBook conference about corporate leadership. On Nov. 1, less than three months after the Australian “coup,” Lachlan appeared onstage in the Time Warner Center in Midtown Manhattan. Tieless, in a white shirt, a navy suit and his trademark black outback boots, he offered a selfless account of the Disney deal. “We immediately saw that this made a great deal of strategic sense,” he told his interviewer, the New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin. He asked Murdoch if there was any part of him that was disappointed at the prospect of the shrinking of his would-be empire. “Your first thought is shareholders,” Lachlan replied. During the brief Q. and A. that followed, Lachlan dismissed the critics of Fox News as narrow-minded. “No, I’m not embarrassed by what they do at all,” he said of the network’s prime-time hosts. “I frankly feel that in this country, we all have to be more tolerant of each other’s views.”

In the days leading up to the conference, some Fox News hosts and guests had been moving ever closer to openly embracing the most bigoted sentiments of the white-nationalist movement. A few days before the anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 Jewish worshipers, a guest on Lou Dobbs’s show had said that a migrant caravan headed to the United States border from Honduras was being funded by the “Soros-occupied State Department.” (The network apologized.) The shooter, according to a post he made on social media, had come to believe that Jews were transporting members of the migrant caravans. When Tucker Carlson came under fire for his increasingly pointed attacks on immigration — “We have a moral obligation to admit the world’s poor, they tell us, even if it makes our country poorer and dirtier and more divided” — he received personal text messages of support from Lachlan, according to two people familiar with the texts.
The lines between Fox News and the Trump White House were continuing to blur. At Hannity’s urging, Trump hired the unemployed Bill Shine as his deputy chief of staff for communications in the summer of 2018, ushering in a new era of increased hostility between the White House and the mainstream media: Within days of his arrival in Washington in July 2018, Shine called the Fox control room to change an onscreen chyron about Ivanka Trump that he considered unflattering, according to a source inside Fox, who says his request was denied. Shine also barred Kaitlan Collins, a CNN White House reporter, from an event after she asked Trump several questions about Michael Cohen and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Unlike his father, Lachlan did not have a long-term relationship with Trump, but he hired the former White House communications director Hope Hicks as the new chief communications officer for the new Fox. Hicks was only 29, but she was the rare member of Trump’s inner circle who left the administration on good terms, and she remained very close to the president, the Trump family and others in the White House. (Kushner has privately told people that he provided a reference for her to Murdoch.)
Lachlan’s first initiative was Fox Nation, a subscription-only, on-demand streaming service started last fall for Fox “superfans.” It would be a platform for a new generation of Fox stars and viewers. One of its most prominent personalities was Tomi Lahren, a 26-year-old recent graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who had built a large social-media following with bite-size quips; for instance, she referred to Black Lives Matter as “the new KKK” and to refugees as “rape-ugees.” Most of its shows would be live-streamed during the day, making it a convenient alternative to the network’s daytime news programming, which was too politically neutral for many Fox watchers. And because Fox Nation was on the internet, the content could be even less restrained than the network’s evening programming. In addition to opinion-heavy political coverage, there would also be lighter fare — such as a cooking show with the “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy — and “deep dives,” including a documentary about the former anchor of the CBS Evening News: “Black Eye: Dan Rather and the Birth of Fake News.” Lachlan’s longer-term plan was to take this undiluted, unchecked form of Fox News overseas.
Roger Ailes once blocked Sean Hannity from hosting a Tea Party fund-raiser on his show. When Hannity and the Fox host Jeanine Pirro joined Trump onstage at his final rally before the November midterm elections, the old Ailesian concern that the network should keep at least some distance from its political allies had come to feel quaint. Hannity played to the crowd, referring to all the reporters in the press pen as “fake news” and praising Trump’s accomplishments. After a tepid rebuke from management for participating in the rally, he clarified his comments about the press: They were not intended to refer to Fox’s reporters at the rally, he said, just the rest of the media.
When Sean Hannity of Fox News appeared onstage at a rally with President Trump — and called the press corps “fake news” from the podium — it was the culmination of the network’s shift from its “fair and balanced” founding days to a post-Ailes MAGA messaging machine.

At times, Fox News seemed to be dictating presidential policy, or at least channeling the base that appeared to control the White House’s agenda. In late 2018, Trump was heading toward a budget deal with the newly ascendant Democrats until guests and hosts across the network started shaming him, demanding that he not sign any government spending bills that didn’t include $5 billion for a border wall. “Don’t listen to squish advisers,” urged Pete Hegseth, a “Fox & Friends” host. He didn’t. He listened to Fox instead and shut down the federal government. It was the made-for-TV climax of a campaign started months earlier. And like the enduring paralysis of the British government and the political upheaval in Australia, it was the legacy of a single family that was now descending into a chaos of its own.
18. ‘I can’t leave’
Having spent almost his entire adult life trying to prove that he was worthy of running the Murdoch empire, James had finally broken with it. He struck out on his own at the end of 2018, setting up his own family office in a new building in Greenwich Village to manage his vastly expanded fortune and invest in technology start-ups. By now, he and his brother were barely on speaking terms.
James had always accepted as a given the interlacing of politics and business that had built his family’s fortune. He had even practiced his own version of it, however unsuccessfully, in London. He had stayed with the company for more than two decades, to prove himself to his father and because of dynastic obligation. “I can’t leave,” he told a friend during the hacking scandal. “I was brought up to do this.” The bonds were not just emotional: His fortune was tied up in his holdings in the family business. In the end, his father had chosen Lachlan. The empire that James had long sought to run was being dismantled. Lachlan had won their lifelong competition to become their father’s heir, but then, what had he really won? To friends, James dismissed his brother’s new company as “an American political project.”

But even now, James couldn’t fully distance himself from the new company: He was still holding a large chunk of its voting stock, and as long as that was the case, his fortunes would be tied to Lachlan’s “American political project.” He couldn’t cash out, because Murdoch had made sure that none of his children would be able to sell their voting shares to an outsider. And yet, as levers with which to influence the company, these shares were virtually useless because their father remained the controlling shareholder in the family trust. James saw only one solution. He would sell his stock to Lachlan and his father, and maybe his sisters would join him. What was once a complex family dynasty would become a simple hereditary monarchy. Elisabeth and Prudence enthusiastically agreed. Murdoch, too, was excited about the idea, seeing it as an opportunity to rid the company of an in-house critic. He urged Lachlan to do it: The two of them, father and son, would own the company together. The documents were drawn up, but in late 2018, given the chance to have the company to himself, Lachlan balked. (Through a spokesman, Lachlan said that buying out his siblings wasn’t financially feasible.)
Had Murdoch won or lost? On the one hand, Murdoch had achieved everything he wanted. He had made all his children multibillionaires, while not only keeping the division of his company that was most dear to him but also passing on control of it to his favorite son. Everyone, Murdoch included, had thought Hillary Clinton was going to win in 2016, but he had made a bet on a different candidate — and the power of a countervailing historical force — and he’d been rewarded with ratings, money and access. And yet that bet had torn apart both his family and his company. What was left was not a sprawling media empire that contained all his ambitions, but a political weapon.
James and Kathryn were planning to devote some of their fortune to try to neutralize that weapon. In early 2019, their foundation, Quadrivium, announced initiatives to defend democratic nations against what they saw as the rising threat of illiberal populism and to bolster voting rights.
The Disney deal was scheduled to close in the spring. During the family’s final months as the owners of the storied 21st Century Fox, they attended the Oscar festivities one last time. It had long been an annual event for the Murdochs; in an earlier era, the family hosted a few events of their own, celebrity-filled parties at their Beverly Hills home.
There was a brief but memorable exchange at the Vanity Fair dinner during the ceremony. In one sense, it was a recapitulation of the ideological conflict that was dividing both the Murdochs and the world. In another, it was just a family spat. When it came to the Murdochs, was there really a difference?
At the Vanity Fair dinner during the ceremony, Kathryn was seated next to Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and a host of the vehemently anti-Trump podcast “Pod Save America.” Lovett did not seem thrilled with his table assignment, but as he and Kathryn started talking, it quickly became clear that she did not share the politics of the Murdoch family business. The conversation inevitably turned to Fox News and the damage it was doing. Kathryn offered to introduce Lovett to the chief executive of the network, her brother-in-law, who was seated at a table nearby. Lovett initially resisted — “I don’t need to talk to this person. It’s not going to be pleasant for anyone” — but later in the evening, Kathryn brought them together.
“Do you feel proud of what’s happening between 8 and 11 every night?” Lovett asked. “You think this is good for the world?”
“Yeah, I think they’re doing a great job,” Lachlan replied. Then Lachlan threw the question back at Lovett: Were there any conservative voices he would accept on Fox? Before Lovett could answer, Kathryn interjected, ticking off a list of anti-Trump Republicans.
Lachlan turned away and joined another conversation.
19. ‘I don’t see how it can get much better than this’
On the morning of March 19, 2019, the new, streamlined Fox officially became a publicly traded, if Murdoch-controlled, company, with Lachlan as its chairman and chief executive and Murdoch as co-chairman. Its name was simply Fox Corporation. A week earlier, Fox News held its first “upfront” for advertising agencies, trying to reassure skittish ad buyers that the network represented a “safe” brand for their products, according to a report in Ad Age. There were videotaped interviews with Fox News viewers — “they deliver the news accurately and honestly” — and a panel discussion with Fox personalities, who expressed optimism about the state of the country and the network. “This is a great time to be an American,” Laura Ingraham said. “Pretty much right now, I don’t see how it can get much better than this.”
In the 22-year history of the network, the Fox News Effect had never been more pronounced. A March study by Navigation Research, a Democratic firm, found that 12 percent of Fox News viewers believe that climate change is mostly caused by humans, compared with 62 percent of all other Americans. At the same time, 78 percent of Fox viewers believe that Trump has accomplished more than any president in American history, compared with 17 percent of other Americans.

The same could be said of the more global Murdoch effect. Brexit-inspired chaos continued to rattle Britain. Both of Theresa May’s proposals to formalize the country’s break with the European Union were rejected by the British Parliament. The possibility of a “no-deal Brexit” — in which the country would simply crash out of the European bloc, quite possibly triggering a historic economic collapse — loomed. In late March, more than a million protesters took to the streets of London to demand a second Brexit referendum. With May’s fellow conservatives questioning her continued leadership of the party, a former Murdoch columnist, editor and friend, Michael Gove — now a member of Parliament — was being talked about as a possible replacement.
Thousands of miles away, another consequence of the global ethnonationalist fervor that the Murdoch empire had amplified and mainstreamed was playing out in New Zealand, where an Australian white nationalist, Brenton Tarrant, stood accused of killing 50 worshipers at two Christchurch mosques on March 14. There was no direct connection between Tarrant and Sky Australia, but critics of the network quickly drew attention to its consistently anti-Muslim rhetoric. In an online comment, unearthed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Tarrant had described Trump’s election as “one of the most important events in modern history.” He was also a fan of the white nationalist Blair Cottrell, whose appearance on Sky Australia over the summer caused American Express to pull its ads from the network. Following the massacre, a young Muslim employee of Sky News in Australia quit in protest. “Over the past few years, I was playing a role — no matter how small — in a network whose tone I knew would help legitimize radical views present in the fringes of our society,” she wrote in a post on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s website.
In the United States, what remained of the Murdoch empire was already gearing up for the 2020 presidential election. One of its first steps was to bring The New York Post more in line with Fox News. The paper had long been Trump’s first read — it was delivered daily to the White House — but its coverage was not uniformly favorable. In January, the Murdochs brought back one of the paper’s former editors, Col Allan, to help run the paper. An old Trump golf partner, Allan had come up through Australia’s tabloids and has been described as “Rupe’s attack dog.” Jesse Angelo, The Post’s publisher — and James’s lifelong best friend — resigned shortly after hearing the news.
Across Fox News, hosts treated the submission of the Mueller Report in late March as the end of a two-year witch hunt and the beginning of Trump’s re-election campaign. The probe had resulted in the indictments of 34 individuals; guilty pleas and convictions from five former Trump business associates or former campaign officials; and a number of ongoing state, federal and congressional investigations. But on Fox’s prime time, Mueller’s decision against bringing new indictments was portrayed as vindication of what the hosts had been telling the audience all along: The investigation was a deep-state coup by the Democrats, helped along by mainstream reporters who were deliberately misinforming the public. The Democrats and their allies in the press had failed to overthrow Trump this time, Fox’s hosts and their guests warned, but their efforts would only grow more intense in the coming months. “They need to be pummeled into the political dirt and become acknowledged as the minority they are,” Rush Limbaugh, the dean of the right-wing radio hosts, said on Hannity’s show. The 2020 campaign and the new era of the Murdoch dynasty had begun.

It’s your American public land endowment, your birthright at citizenship.What you may not know is that while you were sleeping through the white noise from the White House, your public servants were put under the control of the oil and gas industry. They have been busy giving away drilling rights on your land for next to nothing. More precisely — per acre, for even less than the cost of a Bacon McDouble, which of course you should eat only in moderation.And they’re doing this in the face of considerable evidence that the rush into industrial plunder of these lands is a huge source of planet-convulsing carbon emissions.But behold: A history-making lawsuit on behalf of children who will inherit this mess could put an end to the Trump administration plan to drill till we drop. Although the courts have never recognized a constitutional right to a livable environment, the lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, has been given a green light to pursue just that.ImageA rally by Our Children’s Trust outside the Supreme Court in October in support of the plaintiffs in Juliana v.

For the first time, a federal judge temporarily halted drilling on federal land because the government did not take into account the climate change impact of that drilling.RelatedMore on public lands.Opinion | Timothy EganThe Last Best Empty Place in AmericaJuly 21, 2017Forget about the unworkable Green New Deal, which Republicans are using as a prop to show how silly both parties are. Cow flatulence! No air travel! The end of “hamberders!” It’s been a gift to right-wing demagogues, looking to further dumb down a Republican base that doesn’t believe anything a wounded earth is trying to tell them.The real action is unfolding now, on federal land. Prior administrations allowed for considerable oil and gas drilling in swaths of the public domain in the West. But President Trump is holding a fire sale for his fellow fossil fools. The amount of federal land offered for drilling is three times what it was under President Barack Obama.It would be one thing if we needed this oil. We don’t. The world is awash in cheap crude. And it would be another if these lands weren’t being used for something that poses an existential threat. They are. Almost 25 percent of American earth-warming emissions originate from industrial action involving public land or offshore leases.The United States is the biggest carbon polluter in history, and now ranks behind only China in greenhouse gas emissions. As well, we’re now the largest crude oil producer in the world. And we’ve become a leading exporter of that oil, just to show how bad of a global citizen we can be.If you force the Trump administration to stop bingeing on public land, you can make an immediate impact on the amount of earth-warming carbon the United States spits into the atmosphere.Such an injunction is what the children represented by a trust in the Juliana lawsuit are trying to do. And it was that sort of injunction, acknowledging the role of drilling on public land in harming us all, that temporarily shut down new leasing on 300,000 acres in Wyoming this month.Another big step is to prevent David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist, from becoming interior secretary. A stooge for his former clients, this Trump nominee was the deputy secretary, while the top job was held by a strange man, Ryan Zinke, who paraded around on a horse named Tonto.It was Bernhardt who tried to block release of a federal analysis showing that two widely used pesticides were so toxic that they “jeopardize the continued existence” of more than 1,200 species of birds, fish and other life-forms without lobbyists, as my colleague Eric Lipton reported this week.ImageDavid Bernhardt at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on his nomination for interior secretary.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesYou can see who Bernhardt is working for: It’s not all the living things under the domain of the emperor of the outdoors. Nor is he looking out for the interests of children, who will have to live with the consequences of action taken by adults in service to carbon pollution.About those kids: Senator Mike Lee of Utah recently took to the floor of his chamber to say that the best response to the mounting chaos of epic floods, searing wildfires and other symptoms of a sick earth is to get married and have children.What he didn’t say was that we hold our public land in trust for the Americans of tomorrow.

Mr. Trump’s attempt to seal off the border by building a wall, and mulling the closure of ports to tamp down on immigration and drug smuggling, is at odds with a nagging reality: Smuggling activity largely comes through ports of entry, according to government data. And the president’s move to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ignores a longstanding strategy touted by aid groups and military experts — including the president’s former chief of staff — that supporting those countries actually makes the border safer.Still, Mr. Trump spent the week emboldened by the results of his attorney general’s summary of a report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that said that he and his campaign had not cooperated with the Russian government. The president immediately turned back to immigration as a red-meat issue for supporters ahead of the 2020 election.“I’m not playing games,” he told reporters during a weekend in Florida, which followed a week spent berating the Democratic Party for what he called lax immigration laws, assailing countries he has accused of doing little to stop the flow of migrant traveling north, and disparaging individual travelers seeking asylum as part of a “big fat con job.”In the interview, Mr. Mulvaney criticized Jeh Johnson, who led the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, for saying in an interview last week that the situation at the border was “truly in a crisis.” Last month, 76,000 migrants were apprehended crossing the border — an 11-year high — and the crossings are expected to increase again this month.“We hate to say we told you so,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “We need border security, and we’re going to do the best we can with what we have.”In recent weeks, Border Patrol facilities along the southwestern border have been strained to a breaking point by the largest influx of migrants in years. The numbers are growing, in part, because travelers are hoping to make the journey north before summertime. Officials in El Paso resorted to creating a makeshift encampment under a bridge last week when the main border processing facility in the area was strained to 400 percent of its capacity.Image“We need border security, and we’re going to do the best we can with what we have,” Mick Mulvaney, President Trump’s acting chief of staff, said in a recent interview.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesA full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the United States from one of its largest trading partners, and it could leave American citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the United States. Mr. Trump will travel to Calexico, Calif., to tour the border on Friday.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement on Friday that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border, and suggested that American citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result.And by directing the State Department to revoke aid from the three Northern Triangle countries, Mr. Trump is seeking to punish those countries for what he says is a failure to stop migrant caravans from making their way north.Leaders of those countries have said they are committed to solving the problem, despite what Mr. Trump has said. In 2017, the United States gave $420 million to Central American countries struggling with violence. According to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a nonprofit organization that supports diplomatic efforts of the United States, the Northern Triangle countries committed about ten times that amount, or $5.4 billion, to improve conditions.“American aid to Central America is not charity, but an investment in our national security,” Liz Schrayer, the president of the coalition, said in a statement. “The idea of suspending the relatively small, but essential foreign assistance to the region will only exacerbate the root causes driving people to flee their homes — brutal violence, hunger and instability.”In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union,” who pointed out to him that experts within the president’s own administration have said aid money has helped curb violence in and migration from El Salvador, Mr. Mulvaney shrugged off the data from “career staffers” and said the money had not done enough.“If we’re going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars, we would like them to do more,” he said. “If it’s working so well why are the people still coming?”Mr. Mulvaney’s comments represent a rightward shift for an administration that has already taken a publicly hard-line stance on immigration. In May 2017, John F. Kelly, the president’s former chief of staff and former top officer of the military’s Southern Command, said during an Atlantic Council meeting that his experience showed him that partnering with Northern Triangle countries was key to securing the border.“If we can improve the conditions — the lot of life of Hondurans, Guatemalans, Central Americans,” Mr. Kelly, then speaking in his capacity as homeland security secretary, “we can do an awful lot to protect the southwest border.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Aide Defends Trump’s Plan to Close the Border, Saying ‘We Told You So’.

There is one for every occasion. When you have an audience embroiled in problems of governance — and since no one has thought to release the Mueller report in iambic pentameter — might as well pluck “Julius Caesar” off the shelf.A political nail-gnawer about a self-absorbed populist and the men who conspire to impeach him one knife wound at a time, “Julius Caesar” is practically bespoke for 2019 America. Surely someone has already fantasy-cast it with Democratic hopefuls. Elizabeth Warren as Metellus Cimber? Discuss. But Shana Cooper’s revival at Theater for a New Audience — busy and butch — is so deep in conversation with itself and its dance battles that it nearly forgets to speak to us today.Ms. Cooper’s production originated at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2017, just before the Public Theater’s Breitbart-baiting staging, which featured a cigar-puffing combed-over Gregg Henry as Caesar. Here, the analogues are fuzzier, nearly opaque. We don’t seem to be in Rome, or necessarily in America either, but in some half-made city-state of the mind. The set, by Sibyl Wickersheimer, is a loose scaffold of plastic sheeting, plywood pallets and splintered Sheetrock. (Has anyone ever blamed Rome’s decline and fall on bad contractors?) This is a house already divided against itself. Anyone in the first few rows should probably be issued a hard hat.The play, here titled “The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,” begins with a crew of plebes dressed in gray masks, white dreads and jean shorts. Apparently, they’re celebrating Lupercalia, though their frolic looks a lot more like heavy metal night on the Westside piers. (Despite the casting of women in a few small male roles, this is a homosocial world and potentially a homoerotic one — a lot of the pants are too tight.) A ceiling cradle spills confetti, and here comes Caesar (Rocco Sisto), smug and smiling, cruising through the crowd like some conquering schooner. Already a hero, Caesar, we are told, wants to be a king, a tyrant, maybe even a god. For the Roman Republic to live, and because obstruction charges aren’t really an option, Caesar has to die.The ethical brain teaser that activates the play is the question of whether it’s O.K. to do terrible things for not so terrible reasons, that old means-and-ends riddle. Short answer: No. So if anyone out there is hatching extrajudicial plans to remove controversial world leaders, Shakespeare has some words and a creepy dream sequence for you. Let’s just say that to go into the marketplace chanting “Peace, freedom, liberty” is rarely a good look when your hands are still bloody.ImageMs. Cooper supplies a lot of stage blood and dance numbers that look like an especially savage Zumba class.CreditJenny Anderson for The New York TimesThe horns of that dilemma often fail to jab here. Ms. Cooper’s staging is virile — under Christopher Akerlind’s lighting, it is also occasionally sculptural. She seems more interested in moving bodies around rather than showing us what the minds inside those bodies might be thinking. Once in a while her work is electric, like the murder of Cinna the Poet at the hands and feet of a Caesar-supporting mob. But the scene in the marketplace is probably the production’s best, because it cools the spectacle and trusts the language and the men who speak it.Shakespeare spikes his play with enigmas (is Caesar really so ruthless, is Brutus really so upright), and we look to a director to help us puzzle them out. Instead, Ms. Cooper supplies a lot of stage blood and a lot of stage business and dance numbers that look like an especially savage Zumba class.Mr. Sisto’s Caesar, confident and fatuous, doesn’t suggest his ambition or its lack. Jordan Barbour’s Mark Antony, first discovered with the Lupercalia ravers, remains a cipher. As Brutus, Brandon J. Dirden — an actor of intrinsic warmth and gravitas — communicates Brutus’s nobility, though to sell it he often falls into the rhythms of a sermon, and even this characterization feels thin.Matthew Amendt’s Cassius is appropriately lean, and Stephen Michael Spencer’s Caska seems like the kind of guy who joins a vicious assassination scheme just for the hell of it. Barret O’Brien’s Decius Brutus has some neatly weaselly moments. The other conspirators mostly just glom together. The women in the play have perilously little to do, so Ms. Cooper puts Tiffany Rachelle Stewart’s Calphurnia and Merritt Janson’s Portia into scenes where they don’t belong, which helps a little. (Ms. Janson, a spiky and willowy performer, is always worth watching.) Mostly, the actors have enough comfort with the language to put across its essential meaning, but not the ease either to play with it or against it.Sitting in the theater as blood splashed and walls fell, I couldn’t tell what had attracted Ms. Cooper to the play beyond its violence. The lines from 1599 and the world as it is today must have formed a kind of couplet in her mind. But that rhyme refused to scan. I could admire the pictures on the stage and the stamina of the actors who made them, but the story and its themes kept eluding me. I’d wanted to think about tyranny and justice and the danger of radical action and what any of us can and should do, even when, or especially because, I’m feeling my own resistance fatigue and deleting most calls to action unread. I didn’t think about those things. I thought about the dance routines.And still, I was struck, maybe for the first time, by one of the play’s most slippery ironies. Assuming best motives, Brutus and the other conspirators kill Caesar to preserve the Roman Republic. But the Republic dies anyway, and representative government stays dead. For centuries. “Julius Caesar” is a reminder, unneeded, of what a very fragile thing a democracy can be.

DayAdvertisementDealBook Business and PolicySupported byDealBook Briefing: It’s Lyft I.P.O. DayImageCreditCreditLucy Nicholson/ReutersMarch 29, 2019Good Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The first gig-economy I.P.O. is hereAs of this morning, Lyft is officially the first in a new wave of Silicon Valley companies to begin trading on the public markets, Michael de la Merced and Kate Conger of the NYT report.The ride-hailing service is now valued at more than $24 billion, after robust investor demand helped Lyft price its initial public offering last night at $72 a share, up from its first price range of $62 to $68. The company sold more shares than planned, raising over $2.3 billion.It begins trading on the Nasdaq this morning, under the ticker symbol LYFT. Investors will be anxious to see how big a “pop” its shares will enjoy. Some analysts have already given it a “buy” recommendation.Lyft’s stock sale will yield a windfall for its investors, including Rakuten of Japan, G.M. and Andreessen Horowitz. The company’s co-founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, will become multimillionaires.But a big challenge lies in sustaining its valuation. Lyft is deeply in the red — it lost nearly $1 billion last year — and has told investors that it will remain so for some time. Matt Phillips and Erin Griffith of the NYT note that early investors captured the biggest gains, making it unclear how much is left for the public market.Wells Fargo’s embattled C.E.O. steps downTim Sloan, who took over Wells Fargo as the bank became embroiled in scandal, abruptly resigned yesterday, as the lender remains mired in legal battles.He became C.E.O. in 2016 after his predecessor, John Stumpf, resigned amid growing scandals at Wells Fargo. (Among them: the opening of sham accounts in customers’ names and improper customer fees.) Mr. Sloan was supposed to help the bank move on.But Mr. Sloan became a lightning rod, as employees complained about a toxic workplace culture and lawmakers and regulators fumed over a lack of reform at the bank. “I could not keep myself in a position where I was becoming a distraction,” he told investors yesterday.Critics welcomed the news. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had called on regulators to oust Mr. Sloan, tweeted, “About damn time.” Shareholders also appeared relieved, with Wells Fargo’s stock rising 2 percent in after-hours trading.He’ll be replaced on an interim basis by Allen Parker, Wells Fargo’s general counsel and a former partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Mr. Parker got the job in part because he has good relationships with the bank’s regulators, according to the NYT.ImageCreditJosh Edelson/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe U.S. sues Facebook over housing discriminationThe Department of Housing and Urban Development accused Facebook in court yesterday of engaging in housing discrimination, Katie Benner, Glenn Thrush and Mike Isaac of the NYT write.• H.U.D. says that the social network allows advertisers “to restrict who is able to see ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin.”• It also says Facebook “uses its data-mining practices to determine which of its users are able to view housing-related ads.”“The lawsuit coincides with a broader push by civil rights groups to scrutinize whether big technology companies are reinforcing real-world biases online by using algorithms to identify and target specific groups of users,” Ms. Benner, Mr. Glenn and Mr. Isaac write.Facebook now faces federal investigations into its business practices from H.U.D., the F.T.C., the S.E.C. and the Justice Department.More: The company has tightened rules on political ads in Europe ahead of the European Parliament elections in May.Why did Ghosn fall? Protectionism, perhapsCarlos Ghosn’s vision of merging Nissan and Renault was controversial within the companies. And according to the WSJ, it was Nissan executives’ fears over France taking a stake in one of Japan’s top companies that led to his downfall.Senior Nissan executives “wanted to derail any possibility of a full combination of Nissan and Renault, which they feared Mr. Ghosn was pushing,” according to the WSJ, which cites documents and unnamed people.They feared French control of the automaker, the WSJ adds. “Two Nissan executives, determined to halt further corporate integration, instigated a probe of Mr. Ghosn, chasing longtime rumors of wrongdoing, until they found evidence of alleged financial crimes to give prosecutors,” the WSJ writes.“The men initiated the probe in April 2018, the same month the French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, laid out the reasons it wanted a merger,” it adds.Merger discussions have indeed been stymied. The question now, according to Hiroko Tabuchi of the NYT, is whether the rifts are too deep to repair.ImageCreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe Brexit day that wasn’tFor two years, March 29, 2019, was supposed to be the day that Britain departed from the E.U. That hasn’t happened.Brexit has now been delayed to at least April 12. Before then, Prime Minister Theresa May — who on Wednesday offered to resign in order to save her Brexit deal — will try once more to win support for her agreement.Lawmakers are trying a new tack to push the deal through. “Ministers said they would disassemble Mrs. May’s deal into its two parts — one called the withdrawal agreement, and the other the political declaration — and ask Parliament to vote Friday only on the first,” Benjamin Mueller of the NYT writes.But the withdrawal agreement is contentious. The document, which outlines the terms of Brexit, doesn’t have backing across Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, nor from Unionist allies in Northern Ireland. But it may appeal to some pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers whose issues are with the political declaration, which outlines Britain’s future relationship with Europe.If the agreement passes today, Parliament will meet the E.U.’s deadline for completing the Brexit process, and would have until May 22 to extract Britain from the bloc. If not, Britain could crash out without a deal on April 12 — or it could ask for a longer extension.Investigators believe software is to blame for Boeing crashThe team studying the recent 737 Max 8 crash in Ethiopia has reportedly reached a preliminary conclusion, according to the WSJ: Glitchy automated anti-stall software activated shortly before the plane crashed.• “The emerging consensus among investigators, one of these people said, was relayed during a high-level briefing at the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.”• It is “the strongest indication yet that the same automated system, called MCAS, misfired in both the Ethiopian Airlines flight earlier this month and a Lion Air flight in Indonesia, which crashed less than five months earlier.”• “The preliminary finding from the ‘black box’ recorders of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 is subject to revisions, according to the people briefed on the matter.”Boeing announced a series of fixes for the anti-stall system on Wednesday. It said that based on what was known about the crashes, MCAS was in need of updating.3 big deals are propping up M.&A.The first quarter of this year was the third-best for deal-making in two decades, according to data from Refinitiv. But that’s thanks largely to three mega-mergers, without which 2019 would be off to a miserable start.• 8,765 transactions worth $927.2 billion were announced in the quarter. That’s a 30 percent drop in the number of deals and a 17 percent drop in their dollar volume compared with the same period last year.• Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $74 billion takeover of Celgene, Aramco’s $69.1 billion bid for Sabic and FIS’s $34 billion offer for Worldpay helped keep M.&A. volumes up.• Deal makers feel like there’s room for improvement. “We’ve been very happy in terms of big deals but we need more deals overall,” Anu Aiyengar, the head of North American M.&A. at JPMorgan Chase, told the FT.• The fear that’s slowly putting clients off deal-making, according to some advisers: recession.ImageThe New York State attorney general, Letitia James.CreditTimothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesN.Y. prosecutors accuse OxyContin’s first family of fraudNew York State’s attorney general sued the Sackler family, which controls the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, yesterday, accusing it of siphoning money from the drugmaker and erasing a paper trail.• “The New York lawsuit alleges that Sackler family members abolished quarterly reports, insisted that numbers be recounted only orally to board members, and voted to pay themselves millions of dollars, often through offshore companies.”• It also accuses the Sacklers of setting up a new drug company, Rhodes, in 2007 to shift the opioid business away from Purdue. (Rhodes eventually overtook Purdue in market share for opioids.)• “The lawsuit also goes well beyond other cases in spelling out in granular detail how pharmaceutical distributors played a role in the opioid epidemic by ignoring blatant ‘red flags’ that indicated mountains of opioids were being diverted for illegal use.”• The Sacklers and Purdue denied the allegations.How Trump inflated his wealthIt’s well-known that President Trump exaggerated his riches to make himself seem wealthier. But David Farenthold and Jonathan O’Connell of the WaPo obtained his so-called “statements of financial condition” — and showed how he embellished the truth.Many figures in the documents weren’t verified, even though they were prepared by his accountants. Instead, the accountants simply wrote down what Mr. Trump described. “In the compilation process, it is not the role of the accountant to assess the values,” one of them said.That led to inflated figures like Mr. Trump claiming that he owned a 2,000-acre vineyard in Virginia (real size: 1,200 acres) or that an estate he owned in Westchester County, N.Y., was worth $261 million (local authorities’ assessment: $20 million).But Mr. Trump may be shielded from fraud claims over some of these documents, because his accounting firm explicitly said it couldn’t vouch for the figures, legal experts said.Revolving doorMorgan Stanley’s president, Colm Kelleher, will retire on June 30, after having helped stabilize one of Wall Street’s most prominent investment banks.Kazuo Hirai, Sony’s chairman and former C.E.O., is retiring.Campbell Soup has named Keith McLoughlin, who served as interim C.E.O. last year, as its new chairman.Barclays has hired Kristin DeClark from Deutsche Bank as co-head of its U.S. equity capital markets business and head of its tech equity capital markets team.The speed readDeals• States like New York are reportedly considering suing to block T-Mobile’s proposed deal for Sprint, even if the Justice Department approves the transaction.
