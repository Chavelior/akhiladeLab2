Read more here.]It could be any day now.After nearly two years, 34 indictments or guilty pleas, and countless angry presidential tweets, the Mueller report, we are told, could be winding down.When Robert Mueller finally sends his findings to the attorney general, what will we do? It depends, in part, on when that happens. For some big stories that have broken outside our typical production schedule — like on a Friday — we’ve put out special editions, a kind of emergency show. We did that when President Trump fired Steve Bannon, his closest White House adviser; when Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.; and when the president bragged to Russian diplomats about firing F.B.I. director James Comey, saying it would take the heat off the Russia investigation.We don’t yet know when the report will land, but we’ve approached this story feeling that our greatest responsibility is to set the right expectations. That’s why we did something we’ve never done before: a series of explanatory episodes designed to set the table for the Mueller report — how its release could happen (or not happen), what it might conclude (or not conclude), and what it would trigger next (or not trigger next).The series is called “What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report),” a nod to Heidi Murkoff and Sharon Mazel’s ubiquitous parenting guide. It began with an explanation of rules surrounding the report’s handoff from the special counsel to the attorney general. It then explored Mueller’s options for recommending charges against President Trump, and concluded with the role of Congress’s oversight committees.The worst thing we, as journalists, can do in moments like this is leave you unprepared to process a historic moment. We hope that if you listen to the series, you’ll feel ready for what the next few days, weeks and months will bring.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.On “The Daily” this week“There’s an entire generation of people who have been exposed to radical extremist politics online.” Kevin Roose on how the internet played a role in the New Zealand mosque attacks.Boeing wanted to avoid expensive training for pilots flying its new line of airplanes.

As we explored that history, producer Jonathan Wolfe called up Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who, until recently, was the only person to ever be cured. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:From ‘The Daily’: A Conversation With the Berlin PatientJonathan Wolfe, a producer for “The Daily,” spoke with Timothy Ray Brown, known as the Berlin patient, who is the first person known to be cured of H.I.V.‘I imagined hearing my father’s voice’When asked what it would be like to hear that a cure for H.I.V. had been found at last, AIDS activist Peter Staley described a scene from the movie “Longtime Companion”: “It’s like a big gay disco. But it’s everybody we’ve lost, and they’re just celebrating. It might be like that.”That moment from Thursday’s episode struck a chord with Stacy Brink, a listener from Charlotte, N.C. And her response struck a chord with us. “As I listened to Mr. Staley, I imagined hearing my father’s voice. My father who died of AIDS in 1986 when I was 7 years old. My father who loved Billy Joel and made the best French toast. My father in his blue robe. My father who I was unable to hug or kiss or lie next to because the doctors feared I would be ‘contaminated.’ Thank you, Mr. Staley, for fighting and for your courage. I look forward to dancing with my dad at the gay disco when we finally have a cure.”That’s it for The Daily newsletter.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.On a recent episode of “The Argument” podcast, I told my colleague Ross Douthat that I thought he was unfairly lumping together different parts of the media when criticizing the coverage of the Russia investigation.Yes, cable television engaged in wild speculation before Robert Mueller issued his report. And, yes, some news outlets, including BuzzFeed News and McClatchy, published stories that today look dubious. But the newsrooms covering the investigation most closely, including The Times and The Washington Post, generally did an excellent job distinguishing among fact, uncertainty and falsehood.I think the coverage of the end of the Mueller investigation was different, however. Across the media spectrum, much of the coverage was problematic.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]To review: Mueller has written a report that very few people have seen. Its only official public description has come from William Barr, the attorney general whom President Trump appointed primarily because of Barr’s hostility to the investigation. And the difference between Barr’s letter and Mueller’s report has created widespread confusion.“The press, to put it mildly, has not handled the confusion well,” Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes write in Lawfare. The media “dramatically overstated what Barr had actually said about the report,” Jurecic and Wittes write, and also incorrectly suggested Trump had been cleared of wrongdoing. The coverage also underplayed Barr’s bias.In their article, Jurecic and Wittes offer several pieces of advice for anybody who will be covering — or trying to understand — the fuller version of the Mueller report, once it’s made public. Barr has said he will release a redacted version by early next week. Among the article’s advice:Focus on what the report actually says, rather than trying to offer overly sweeping descriptions of what it means.Pay more attention to the details of the report than to the reactions from Congress, the White House and elsewhere.Be careful not to confuse a judgment about whether certain conduct is prosecutable with a judgment about whether it happened.Remember that some behavior that is not prosecutable can still be wrong or damaging to national security.Don’t assume that all redactions are inappropriate attempts by Barr to protect Trump.Be open to the possibility of multiple, complicated story lines.All of this strikes me as good advice.Related: James Fallows of The Atlantic says that The Seattle Times did a better job putting the Barr letter in context than much of the national media did.Reader critiqueIn email and on social media, I’ve heard several thoughtful critiques of my article on climate policy for The Times Magazine. I don’t necessarily agree with the criticisms, but I want to share them.Advocates of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs have said that I am too pessimistic about their near-term political feasibility. If voters can first become convinced of the need for climate action, they will eventually come around to carbon pricing, because it’s the most effective solution, the advocates say. California is following a version of this path: The state committed to a sharp reduction in carbon emissions a decade ago and has recently been strengthening its cap-and-trade program.For longer arguments in favor of carbon pricing, see a 2017 Milken Institute Review article by Jerry Taylor or a 2016 Times column about British Columbia by Eduardo Porter.From the other side of the debate, David Roberts of Vox says I was too positive about carbon-pricing policies. “It may be so that a tax is the most efficient single, comprehensive climate policy, but it is *simply not true* that in every economic sector or technological domain, a tax is more efficient — especially if the tax is below the ‘optimal’ level, which [it] is always,” Roberts wrote in a Twitter thread.Finally, Paul Krugman, in his column this morning, makes an important distinction between the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

April 8, 2019ImageCreditCreditMichael George HaddadThe House Judiciary Committee may be sitting on its subpoena for the Mueller report, but under federal law, certain other committees need neither a subpoena nor a court order to get access to it and its underlying materials, including grand jury testimony and documents.The House and Senate Intelligence Committees should already have certain investigative materials relating to Russian election meddling, in unredacted form, collected by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. This legal structure was created by a provision in the Patriot Act combined with the notification provisions of the National Security Act. The intelligence committees have a lawful right, virtually unbounded, to foreign intelligence information in the possession of the intelligence agencies of the executive branch. Federal law requires that the attorney general provide to the director of national intelligence any foreign intelligence information collected during a criminal investigation. Then the director must by law provide it to the intelligence committees of Congress — either by sending a notification or acting in response to a request from the committees. The director has an obligation to inform policymakers, including Congress, of intelligence assessments so that they can take steps to protect the American people.The process is not a partisan tool or a method to take down President Trump. It’s about national security. The relevant federal statutes follow a two-stage process: First, the language of Section 3040 of Title 50 of the United States Code — part of the Patriot Act — mandates that the attorney general “shall expeditiously disclose to the director of national intelligence” foreign intelligence acquired in a criminal investigation (which may include limitations necessary to protect continuing investigations).Another provision of that act affects grand jury secrecy and disclosure. During the negotiations over the bill, the Justice Department wanted a “may share” exception to grand jury secrecy. Critically, however, the Senate Intelligence Committee insisted on a “must share” provision.If the process were working as it was designed, after the director of national intelligence receives relevant material from the Justice Department, the executive branch intelligence agencies would use it to assess and improve their own efforts in deciphering the plans, intentions and capabilities of foreign governments and entities.Second, when the information has moved to the director, 50 USC Section 3092 of the National Security Act kicks in. This requires the director, and all intelligence agencies under his control, to keep the congressional intelligence committees “fully and currently informed” of all intelligence activities (and any significant failures). Any information that arguably falls outside the notification provisions must, nevertheless, be handed over if the intelligence committees ask for it.In this case, if the attorney general had provided information from the Mueller investigation to the director, the director would have been obligated to notify the intelligence committees of the agencies’ activities based on that intelligence.If the director did not provide it, the congressional committees could and should have demanded the information. At least in the House, it looks like that didn’t happen. When Democrats took over this year, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, ramped up its investigation, but statements by him suggest that the committee has not yet received foreign intelligence obtained during the Mueller investigation.So, by design or by ignorance, the executive branch agencies may not have followed the laws they have sworn to uphold. And the congressional committees may have failed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities. The House Intelligence Committee should demand immediate attention to the mandates of the Patriot and National Security Acts. The committee’s staff should make informal inquiries to determine whether, and the extent to which, William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Dan Coats provided this information to the intelligence committees. If the inquiry yields nothing or reveals that the law has not been followed, Mr. Barr, Mr. Coats and others in the executive branch should be called to testify before the committee.Even with the completion of the Mueller investigation, Mr. Barr has argued that grand jury information is sacrosanct and will be redacted from the materials he gives to Congress and the public. Yet the entire purpose of Section 3040, as well as the specific exception added to the grand jury secrecy rules themselves, were to require the identification and sharing of critical intelligence collected by law enforcement during an investigation, and certainly after it has ended. Moreover, the constitutional requirements for congressional access mandate that the executive branch give all national security information to Congress — if the intelligence committees demand it. No court has ever ruled that the executive can withhold such information from Congress. As a nation in 2001 we learned a very painful lesson, that keeping vital foreign intelligence from the intelligence agencies, and ultimately Congress, must give way in the face of potential terrorist attacks.If Mr. Barr wants to argue that attacks by foreign enemies on our democracy are any less critical to our national security than terrorism, we will see how Congress and the American people respond. the mueller reportOpinion | Jerrold L.

Defends Release of Limited Glimpse of Mueller’s Findings - The New York Times

Defends Release of Limited Glimpse of Mueller’s FindingsAdvertisementSupported byJustice Dept. Defends Release of Limited Glimpse of Mueller’s FindingsImageThe Justice Department defended its rollout of the special counsel’s report, saying it is subject to departmental regulations.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Katie BennerApril 4, 2019WASHINGTON — The Justice Department defended Attorney General William P. Barr’s handling of the special counsel report on Thursday, saying that it had to be scrubbed of sensitive information, amid revelations that some members of the office have said he failed to adequately portray their findings and the extent to which they could damage President Trump.“Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the attorney general decided to release the report’s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process,” a Justice Department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement.At issue is a four-page letter that Mr. Barr wrote to lawmakers on March 24 outlining the main findings of the nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Quoting sparingly from the nearly 400-page report delivered to him two days earlier, the attorney general revealed that Mr. Mueller had declined to decide whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry and that Mr. Barr himself had stepped in to conclude that Mr. Trump did not commit an obstruction offense.[Some of the Mueller investigators said that the attorney general failed to adequately represent their findings.]Some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators have told associates in recent days that Mr. Barr could have released more of their own work, government officials and others familiar with their frustrations told The New York Times for an article published on Wednesday.Mr. Trump attacked the article, falsely asserting on Twitter that Times reporters relied on “no legitimate sources,” a longstanding tactic of his to try to dismiss news reports that portray him negatively.Read Attorney General William Barr’s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter, by Attorney General William P. Barr, details the main findings of the special counsel’s two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Barr has told lawmakers that his letter was an update of his progress in reviewing the report and that the document was not intended to fulfill a requirement under Justice Department regulations that he send a summary to Congress at the end of any special counsel investigation. Though Ms. Kupec said Mr. Barr was not trying to summarize the report, she was referring only to the regulatory requirement for a summary.Ms. Kupec also said that the report and its release were subject to the regulations, which stipulate that Mr. Mueller prepare a confidential document of his findings intended only for the attorney general. She also said that sensitive information had to be blacked out first, noting that “every page of the ‘confidential report’” was marked with a warning that it may contain secret grand jury testimony. Mr. Barr and other law enforcement officials are also reviewing the document for classified material, information about continuing investigations and derogatory details about third parties not directly related to the inquiry.The attorney general has said he is aiming to send to lawmakers a redacted version of the report by mid-April. Under the regulations, he is free to release parts or all of it if he decides it is in the public interest.The special counsel’s report included summaries of the major findings, and some team members believed Mr. Barr should have included more of their material in his March 24 letter, according to the government officials. But the attorney general “does not believe the report should be released in a ‘serial or piecemeal fashion,’” Ms. Kupec said, citing a letter that Mr. Barr wrote to lawmakers on Friday.Justice Department officials have also said they determined that the summaries contained sensitive information that needed to be reviewed before they were released.Democrats have demanded full access to the report. The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, use a subpoena to compel Mr. Barr to turn over a complete copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Mr. Nadler said on Thursday that the reports about frustration among members of the special counsel team would not alter his plan to give Mr. Barr a bit more time to hand over the report voluntarily before issuing a subpoena.“It is his duty to release the entire report,” Mr. Nadler said of Mr. Barr. “We were demanding he do so and he hasn’t done so.”But given the frustrations expressed by some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators, Mr. Nadler asked Mr. Barr in a letter on Thursday to turn over all communications between the special counsel’s office and other Justice Department officials about the report, including discussions about the disclosure of the report to Congress or the public and about Mr. Barr’s March 24 letter.Mr. Nadler also said that Mr. Barr had undermined his own desire to release the report all at once when he outlined the principal conclusions “in a fashion that appears to minimize the implications of the report as to the president.”And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that he would ask the Senate to pass a resolution calling for the Justice Department to provide transparency on the results of the special counsel’s work.But Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has taken a far different tack. He told reporters on Thursday that he had no interest in “retrying” the Mueller investigation and trusted Mr. Barr to fairly present its findings.“I don’t think Barr misrepresented the Mueller conclusions,” Mr. Graham said. “I don’t have any interest in taking all the work product and re-litigating it. That’s enough for me.”Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.

Members of the special counsel’s team say something was lost.Thursday, April 4th, 2019michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general, William Barr. The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress. Now, new reporting shows members of Mueller’s team feel that Barr’s summary did not reflect the report they wrote. It’s Thursday, April 4. So take us back to the beginning of last week. What do we know at that point?nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr, taking Bob Mueller’s 300- to 400-page report, had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the “principal conclusions” to just four pages.michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress. Mike Schmidt covers national security.michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had sent his report to the attorney general, said, I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election. But he declined to make a decision on obstruction.nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn’t reach what Barr called a “traditional prosecutorial decision.” In other words, Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn’t go as far as to conclude that he had. He essentially punted to the attorney general’s office.michael schmidtAnd in this case, by Mueller not reaching a determination, he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say, O.K., Mueller didn’t make a determination on this issue of obstruction. He did on collusion. I’m going to look at all the facts. And he makes his determination — no case to be made here on both of these issues. The problem, though, is that the perception is that Mueller, the independent investigator who’s there to do an inquiry free of politics, has not made a call on this central question. But Barr, the president’s appointee, who’s been there just for a few months, is making the decision. So the question is, is the fix in? Why is it, if Mueller didn’t come to an answer, the attorney general did?michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week, we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call. And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call. And the question is, why?michael schmidtIt’s not unusual that Barr made a call. The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not. And he was doing that. What’s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don’t look like they’re on the same page.[music]michael schmidtMueller said, I can’t make a determination on this issue. And Barr did. So why is it that they looked at it differently? Why was it that Mueller, the prosecutor here, didn’t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do, which is make a call?nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we’ve spent the last week trying to figure out. What is the difference here? What is the evidence that they’re looking at? And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice?michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned?nicholas fandosWhat we’ve now learned is that nobody’s happy. The team that was working — or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn’t properly capture what their 22-month investigation found. And Barr’s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job.michael barbaroSo let’s start with the Barr side. Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset.michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice, Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law.michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by “top cover“?michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then, when the investigation is concluded, have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry, the fruits of it, to the public and saying, look, this was done free of politics. We assessed this matter based on the facts. And now you have a result that is exposed, at least in part, to the perception that the president’s guy made the decision.michael barbaroThe attorney general.michael schmidtCorrect.nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller’s appointment in the first place.michael barbaroAnd you’re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position?michael schmidtWell, the system’s not working the way it’s supposed to. You had Mueller there for one reason — yea or nay on crimes. And on one of these central questions, he couldn’t get there. And by stepping back and saying, I don’t know, it allows at least the Democrats to say, what? How was this decision made? How did they get to this? How is it that the president’s political appointee was the ultimate decider?nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say, we need to see all the evidence. We need to see the whole file here because the president’s handpicked man made this decision. Maybe we’d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence. Bob Mueller seems to have.michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper-political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress?nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence, to him, it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge, that the president hadn’t obstructed justice. Now, you’ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power. As Democrats made famous, he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn’t be construed as obstruction of justice. They’re part of his executive powers. And so he looked at this and, I mean, he can’t make the same decision that Mueller did. Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense. And he looked at it and says, well, in our judgment and this team’s judgment, it’s not.michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks, what are you talking about it’s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice? There, in his mind, clearly wasn’t.nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence, basically, of behavior that could be construed as obstructive. He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says, when you add it all up, it doesn’t tip into —michael schmidtCriminality.nicholas fandos— criminal obstructive territory.michael barbaroRight. And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion, to make a call that Mueller wouldn’t, I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr’s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role. And so he was upset to have to make this call, but, it sounds like, felt that he had to.michael schmidtI don’t know if he’s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says, this is not the way it’s supposed to be working. Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law. I’ll step in and do that. And I think I can do that based on the facts.nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role. I’m redacting the report. I’ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out. And then you can make your own judgment. But the public has an intense interest in this. And I’ve got to say something. And I decide whether acts broke the law or not. And I don’t think this one did.michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller’s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so?nicholas fandosWe don’t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question. It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted. It may not have mattered anyway. But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four-page summary, which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction, some members of Mr. Mueller’s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22-month investigation.michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting — that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side, the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side.nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago, members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel, essentially, that his work — if it wasn’t misrepresentative of theirs — didn’t give the full picture, which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general’s letter lets on. Now, we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this. We don’t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks. He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation. But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision-making around these issues that we’ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it’s being characterized.michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment, to the degree you understand it?nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr’s concise four-page letter, they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work. And in fact, what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr. Barr handed over. So not that he shouldn’t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense, but that concurrent with that, he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture. The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them, classified information, secretive grand jury information that couldn’t become public, and ultimately didn’t use any of it.michael schmidtSo what Mueller’s folks are essentially saying is, hey, we wrote these summaries. If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation, and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president, why is it that you didn’t include some of the things that we found?michael barbaroAnd specifically, why didn’t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning? You’re making it seem like the president didn’t do anything wrong.michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr’s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful. And it completely exonerates him. If you’re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump, and you think there’s a lot of questionable behavior there, that is something that is going to irritate you mightily.michael barbaroI mean, do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here? Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship? They wanted to see their work in the public summary.nicholas fandosI don’t think that we fully know. What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team — you should use these things, or we want these things to be out. They seem to have had an intention. And they certainly now have a regret about it. But we don’t know what interaction there was in the actual decision-making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago.michael barbaroWell, so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries, especially the negative material, in his four-page summary?michael schmidtI think there’s one big, broad reason and another contemporary reason, the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and, for many years, prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone, the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated.michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime.michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution, that doesn’t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it.michael barbaroAnd Mike, by the contemporary example you referred to, I’m assuming you’re talking about James Comey.michael schmidtI’m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held. It’s right in the heat of the presidential election. He stands up and says, we, the F.B.I., have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account. We don’t think there is a case to be made here. But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets. The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made.michael barbaroAnd so you’re saying that Barr’s view would be, I’m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere.michael schmidtCorrect. We don’t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone.nicholas fandosThe problem is, this was never a normal or average criminal investigation. It has broad national security implications. And it has implications for almost every decision that’s made at the highest levels of the government.michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president’s conduct. And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they’re saying, look, this is the president of the United States. There’s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see. And O.K., Justice Department, it may not be criminal. But this is the president. And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress. It’s about a pathway of dealing with the president.nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn’t seem to disagree with that, fundamentally. He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible. But he doesn’t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department’s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law. And so he’s grappling with the Justice Department’s aversion to talk about individuals that it’s not saying broke the law. But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen. And so he’s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things.michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation, and the Justice Department determined that I didn’t break the law, then there’s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me. Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct. In this instance, there’s another issue with the president. O.K., the president didn’t break the law. But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about, Congress should know about, and need to be more closely examined. Because maybe it’s not just about breaking the law. It’s about how he conducted himself as president. And does Congress need to deal with that? And what we are starting to see from Mueller’s side is this frustration that, hey, we think there’s some bad stuff that happened here. But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn’t break the law, he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president’s conduct. It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report, the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn’t break the law, and the president turning around and saying, I was fully exonerated. And they’re saying, hey, America, we think more of this process needs to play out.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of, how do we investigate a sitting president? And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that? And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have. In Nixon, that pendulum swung too far in the president’s direction. In the Starr investigation of Clinton, it went the other way. The investigator had too much power. And here, between Mueller and Barr’s teams, they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with. And it’s the same issue that we’ve been looking at for 50 years, just the latest episode of it.michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation, these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate.nicholas fandosCorrect.michael schmidtIt’s how much you can tell the public, and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with? And there’s no clear pathway on that. So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president. Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president’s enemies as trying to get him. And the confidence in that process then erodes. And it’s messy. And it’s hard to figure out. What are the real facts here? What really happened?michael barbaroBut at this point, we’re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress. We’re still waiting on the full report. So won’t this tension that you’re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we’ll ultimately have access to?nicholas fandosIt may be. And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day. But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time. It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report. And for that time, Bill Barr’s conclusion that the president didn’t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative. And I think that what we’re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out, the narrative is baked — so much so that even if it shows, for instance, that the president didn’t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office, that there’s not room to have a full debate around that, that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point, and that it won’t quite matter what the report says for the president’s political fate.michael barbaroNick, Mike, thank you very much.nicholas fandosThank you guys.michael schmidtThanks for having us.archived recording (jerry nadler)The committee has a job to do.

A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics.

The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism.

Barr is testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on budget matters. But Democratic members are also questioning him about his handling of the Mueller report.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Katie Benner, Nicholas Fandos and Charlie SavageApril 9, 2019• Attorney General William P. Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week, reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid-April.• Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report. But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it.• The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June, Mr. Barr revealed.• Mr. Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department’s proposed $29.2 billion budget, which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border.Barr says Mueller report is coming ‘within a week.’Mr. Barr, hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats, reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week.Mr. Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out — like information that is subject to grand-jury secrecy rules — and said that whatever he censors in the report, he will identify the reason.“This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,” he said. “And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.”Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation’s main findings.“The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller’s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,” Mr. Barr said. “The letter on the 29th, I don’t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.”Barr won’t say whether the White House was briefed on the report.Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress. But Mr. Barr refused to answer.“I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today,” he said. “I’ve issued three letters about it. I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday,” March 24, when he wrote a four-page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel’s top-line findings.“But I’ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,” he added. “I’m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it.”In the past, Justice Department officials have said that Mr. Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr. Trump’s team about its contents. His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said.Democrats press Barr on Mueller.Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on what one called “the elephant in the room”: his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel’s report.“The American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,” Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks.“I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,” he added.Democrats have criticized Mr. Barr’s decision to share Mr. Mueller’s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated.On Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person. Ms. Lowey called Mr. Barr’s handling of the Mueller report “unacceptable” and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter.“Even for someone who has done this job before,” she said, referring to Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, “I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.”Barr renews his own public defense.Batting back Democrats’ criticism, Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the “bottom-line” conclusions of the special counsel’s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism.Asked about The Times’s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings, Mr. Barr appeared unswayed.“I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” Mr. Barr said, “because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.”Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway, he said. He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence-gathering and would thus need to be redacted.But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr. Mueller’s team conspicuously did not.Republicans tried to help Mr. Barr hammer home the report’s top-line findings.“The conclusions were simple: no collusion, no obstruction,” said Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, ignoring Mr. Mueller’s statement that the investigation did not “exonerate” Mr. Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia’s election interference.Mr. Graves added, “Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions?”Mr. Barr responded, “There is nothing to suggest to me” that the conclusions have changed. “The letter speaks for itself.”[Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.]Barr won’t ask a judge to let him reveal secret grand jury details.One of the key reasons Mr. Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand-jury information to outsiders.On its face, that rule — known as 6(e) — makes no exception for Congress. There are exceptions to the rule, however, particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed. That happened in 1974, when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon.But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress. Mr. Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand-jury material that Mr. Mueller gathered.But Mr. Barr said he has no such intention. He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material, they can ask the judge.“The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable,” Mr. Barr said, adding: “My intention is not to ask for it at this stage. I mean, if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6(e) does not apply and his need for the information, I’m willing to listen.”Barr recalls Democrats’ anger over the publication of the Starr report.Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report, Mr. Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater-Monica Lewinsky scandal, where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president.Mr. Barr’s point seemed to be: If you have a problem with this process, blame the Clinton Democrats.“This whole mechanism for the special counsel, as I said, was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr’s report,” Mr. Barr said. “That’s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential, because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr’s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report.”Mr. Starr, the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation, was operating under a now-defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public.That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999. But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high-level executive-branch wrongdoing.Under then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Among other things, it called for the special counsel to write a “confidential” report for the attorney general, who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over. In short, those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr. Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read — in any form.“You will recognize that I’m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,” Mr. Barr said. “But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can.”Barr: Don’t worry about defense of health care law. The government will likely lose in court.Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas, where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional.Mr. Cartwright accused Mr. Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage.Mr. Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr. Cartwright that he had “nothing to worry about” if he thought that the department had taken “such an outrageous position” because the government was likely to lose the case in question. “Let the courts do their job,” Mr. Barr said.Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago. Late last year, a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate, and broadened its attack on the law last month, telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated.If the court accepts that argument, millions of people could lose health insurance. Mr. Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the law, though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage.The exchange underscored Mr. Barr’s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president. Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it, Mr. Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible.Barr seeks immigration spending for Trump’s priorities.Mr. Barr is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement — an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges — at a time when Mr. Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers. Over the past two days, he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal.While the additional judges will “provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts,” Mr. Barr said, he also said that an influx of cases “constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.”The Justice Department oversees the nation’s immigration judges, who are separate from the judicial branch.Mr. Barr also said that “attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority” for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than $140 million in budget increases at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes.A review of the Russia investigation will be done in the coming months.The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide, Mr. Barr said.The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how the F.B.I. and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant, in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr. Page.As part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s relationship with Mr. Steele.Mr. Barr also said he was studying the F.B.I.’s decision to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election, Mr. Barr said. He said he was trying to get his “arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation.”Correction: April 9, 2019An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a congresswoman on the House Appropriations Committee.

Barr has been reviewing the nearly 400-page special counsel report to redact sensitive information.CreditCreditT.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageApril 7, 2019WASHINGTON — Investigators for the special counsel spent months trying to get answers from President Trump: what he knew about a meeting between senior campaign aides and Russians; about changes to the Republican Party platform making it more Russia-friendly; about his associates’ outreach to WikiLeaks as it prepared to publish Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers.After months of resistance, his lawyers finally turned over written answers in November to those questions and others. But the public has not seen them.Now, the question of whether they become part of the available history of Russia’s 2016 election interference and its aftermath — along with whatever else the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, may have gathered — turns on Attorney General William P. Barr. Since Mr. Mueller submitted a nearly 400-page report on his investigation two weeks ago, Mr. Barr, his aides and other law enforcement officials have been reviewing it to determine which portions to provide to lawmakers and the public — and what to black out.Democrats in Congress, who have demanded to see the entire document, have expressed growing impatience with Mr. Barr. And members of Mr. Mueller’s team have told associates that Mr. Barr failed to adequately convey findings that were damaging to Mr. Trump in a letter he sent to Congress two weeks ago laying out their chief conclusions.Mr. Barr has promised to give lawmakers — by mid-April, “if not sooner” — as much of the report as possible, subject to several categories of necessary deletions. But much will turn on how expansively or narrowly he interprets those categories.Grand jury informationThe first category that Mr. Barr planned to black out is secret grand jury information. A federal rule of criminal procedure generally forbids disclosure of such material, like citing a witness’s testimony before the jury or a disclosing that a document was obtained with a grand jury subpoena.Notably, however, for the investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, the special counsel gathered information from witnesses primarily through F.B.I. interviews, according to lawyers familiar with the inquiry.Mr. Barr could share grand jury information with Congress if a judge issues an order permitting it, as happened in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. But it is not clear whether the Trump administration’s Justice Department would consent or instead fight any request by lawmakers to see the grand jury material. Nor is it clear that such a ruling would extend to letting the public see that material.It is also not clear whether a key difference from 1974 — the House Judiciary Committee had already opened an impeachment inquiry against President Richard M. Nixon, but none are pending against Mr. Trump — would change the outcome. On Friday, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in an unrelated case, adopted a narrow reading of when courts may authorize the disclosure of grand-jury information and criticized the legal basis for the Watergate precedent, but stopped short of overturning it.Still, Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor and former prosecutor, said the House should ask a judge to intervene.“There is going to be an awful lot of redaction, and the question becomes, ‘What is Congress going to do about that?’” he said. “It seems to me that they can and should go to court. It’s not up to the Justice Department to make the final decision about what Congress sees.”Classified informationThe second category Mr. Barr has identified for redaction is “material the intelligence community identifies as potentially compromising sensitive sources and methods.”Mr. Mueller has already disclosed some elements of his findings in the indictments of Russians for their clandestine manipulations of American social media and their hacking of Democratic emails. But it is virtually certain that Mr. Mueller learned more than what was on display in those court filings — including information whose disclosure could reveal secret American intelligence sources about the Russian government’s inner workings.While all members of Congress have security clearances, Mr. Barr may decide that to reduce the possibility of leaks, certain findings from Mr. Mueller’s investigation can be told only to the intelligence committees, or even just the Gang of Eight, the top congressional leaders and the leaders of the intelligence panels.Current investigationsThe third category Mr. Barr has said will be off limits to Congress is “material that could affect other ongoing matters, including those that the special counsel has referred to other department offices.”In the course of his investigation, Mr. Mueller uncovered information about potential crimes that fell outside his core mandate and handed that evidence to other federal prosecutors. The Southern District of New York, for example, handled the prosecution of Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, for campaign finance and other crimes. That district is also now looking at the Trump inauguration committee’s finances, aspects of which the special counsel’s office previously scrutinized.The special counsel also developed cases that are not yet resolved, including the indictment in Washington of Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump’s longtime associate and adviser, as well as a dispute over a subpoena with an unidentified foreign-owned corporation.And there is something of a wild card: The F.B.I. has an open-ended counterintelligence investigation into Russia.‘Peripheral’ peopleThe fourth category Mr. Barr has said he will redact is “information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”The Justice Department traditionally does not make public unflattering information about people whom prosecutors scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime. By focusing on “peripheral” people, Mr. Barr has indicated that some people are so central to the investigation — presumably including Mr. Trump himself — that he may make an exception and allow more abundant material to go to Congress and become public. But much may depend on his decisions about who counts as central and who counts as a bit player.Privileged informationThere are several types of privilege that could come into play. One is executive privilege, a power of presidents to keep secret from Congress certain internal executive branch information, like communications involving the president or his close advisers and, sometimes, internal agency deliberations. Another is attorney-client privilege, the power to keep secret a client’s discussions with his lawyer.Mr. Trump permitted his aides and legal advisers who might fall under one or both of those privileges, like the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, to speak to Mr. Mueller’s team. But it is not clear whether that waiver would extend to sharing information with Congress, and there are few court precedents to define the limits of that secrecy power.Mr. Barr has told Congress, “Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.” But what he meant is ambiguous, and the Justice Department has declined to provide clarity.Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Barr said he was open to negotiating with lawmakers about revealing some of the delicate information that he and law enforcement officials are blacking out from the special counsel report.CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesBy Katie BennerApril 9, 2019WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr vowed on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the Mueller report “within a week,” defending his handling of the special counsel investigation’s findings as a bid for transparency as Democrats accused him of politically motivated behavior.Mr. Barr said he would explain his redactions and was open to negotiating with lawmakers about revealing some of the delicate information that he and law enforcement officials are blacking out from the highly anticipated report before he sends it to Congress and the public.“This process is going along very well, and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,” Mr. Barr said at a House budget hearing. “And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.”[Read Mr. Barr’s top takeaways from the Mueller report.]But he was less forthcoming about aspects of his review, declining to say whether President Trump had been briefed on the report after Justice Department and White House officials had said for weeks that the president has not been updated on its contents. And he did not explain why he cleared Mr. Trump of committing an obstruction-of-justice offense when Mr. Mueller’s team declined to make a decision.Democrats assailed Mr. Barr’s decision to send a four-page letter to Congress in March outlining the main findings of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, pointing to complaints by members of the special counsel’s team that Mr. Barr failed to fully portray the extent of how damaging their conclusions might be for Mr. Trump.“The American people have been left with many unanswered questions, serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,” said Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department.Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the “bottom line” conclusions from Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired, as well as whether President Trump tried to impede the inquiry. He said that Mr. Mueller declined an opportunity to read his March 24 letter before Mr. Barr sent it to lawmakers. And Mr. Barr warned that trying to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism.“I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” Mr. Barr said, “because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.”Mr. Barr pushed back on Democrats’ complaints that they did not have the report, reminding them that they would be able to read it in days. And as for his four-page letter, he suggested that had he not written it, lawmakers would have bitterly complained if they were given no information or insight into Mr. Mueller’s conclusions during the redaction process.“In my judgment, it was important for people to know the bottom-line conclusions of the report while we worked on necessary redactions to make the whole thing available,” said Mr. Barr, adding that he anticipated that the redactions would take weeks.The back and forth came during an unusually contentious House appropriations subcommittee hearing, where Mr. Barr also defended the Trump administration’s hardening stance on immigration and the Justice Department’s decision to stand down rather than appeal a federal judge’s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Barr also revealed that the Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is wrapping up an examination of parts of the Russia investigation, including accusations that law enforcement officials abused their powers to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. Mr. Horowitz could reveal the results as early as May or June, Mr. Barr said.Though Democrats have for weeks demanded to see the full text of the Mueller report and all underlying investigative materials, Mr. Barr reminded them that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In 1998, Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president.Mueller Report: Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation.Under the current regulations, the special counsel delivers a confidential report of investigative decisions to the attorney general, who is free to decide what to release.“I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can,” Mr. Barr said.To that end, Mr. Barr repeated his promise that lawmakers would receive a redacted report in mid-April and that he would testify about its contents soon afterward. He said that he would identify which of four categories redacted material fell into — secret grand jury testimony, classified information, materials that could affect current investigations and information about peripheral third parties. Those were the same types of information that Democrats have fought to protect when Republicans tried to obtain documents from the Justice Department.Though Mr. Barr said he was open to negotiating whether the department could share some of the redacted details after releasing the report, he took a harder line on grand jury testimony. While Congress can request it in the context of a legal proceeding, he said he was not obligated to honor such a request.Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that once he received the redacted report, he would issue a subpoena for the complete document and petition a court for the grand jury testimony.“If it doesn’t have everything we require to do our work, which is to say the entire report and underlying evidence in it, we will issue subpoenas forthwith,” Mr. Nadler told reporters on Tuesday.Democrats were taking other steps to try to get ahold of information pertinent to the Russia investigation. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters later on Tuesday that he believed requirements that the intelligence agencies regularly update their congressional oversight committees on significant developments could allow a side-door view into the findings of Mr. Mueller and the investigators who worked with him.Mr. Schiff said he had made a request along those lines in recent weeks but had not yet received a response.Justice Department officials have said that they have not shared the report or briefed the White House on its contents, so the demurral raised the possibility that the situation had shifted. Mr. Barr is likely to be pressed on the matter on Wednesday, when he is scheduled to testify before Senate appropriators.Mr. Barr visited Capitol Hill to answer questions about the Justice Department’s proposed $29.2 billion budget for the next fiscal year, which includes money for 100 new judges for immigration courts, which are part of the department, not the judicial system.He also echoed the president’s increasingly hard-line stance on immigration, which has touched off a purge of Department of Homeland Security officials who Mr. Trump believes impeded his goal of shutting the southwestern border entirely.Mr. Barr called the situation along the border with Mexico “unprecedented” and said that part of the Justice Department’s request for an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement would pay for the new immigration judges to tackle a backlog of cases.Democrats, who see health care as one of their top campaign issues, also assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to appeal a Texas judge’s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the sweeping health care law was unconstitutional.Under fire for the decision, Mr. Barr said: “I’m a lawyer. I’m not in charge of health care.” But his comment belied the fact that his refusal to defend a law on the books can effectively shape policy.While Mr. Barr would not disclose any discussions with Mr. Trump over the health care law, he said that he would follow the wishes of the president so long as his request was legally defensible.Nicholas Fandos and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

Barr delivered to Congress his four-page summary of the special counsel’s 300-plus page report.“No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that day. And in the weeks that followed, the president’s message of vindication and revenge on his political antagonists has only intensified, as he has expressed no interest in reading the full report and leveled charges of treason against Democratic lawmakers.Mr. Barr’s letter effectively emboldened Mr. Trump, aides said, even as they prepare for new details to emerge from a redacted version of the report — expected this week — that could renew questions about the president’s fitness for office, and even as some of them cringe at Mr. Trump’s choice of the word “exonerate.” (Privately, they admit, they would prefer he use the word “vindicate.”)But Mr. Trump’s mood has been lighter since the report was filed, people close to him said, even though neither he nor his White House lawyers have seen the full document, or at this point plan to do so before it is released to Congress and to the public. People close to Mr. Trump said they have noticed an increase in his confidence after he spent months feeling weighed down by a loss of control.“When they began to go after people he knew personally, who had worked for him for years, I think it gnawed at him, and I think he felt helpless,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a confidant of Mr. Trump’s.But since Mr. Barr issued his letter, the president has felt liberated and has been testing his bounds. He has poked fun at Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president considering a presidential run, for his handsy approach to politics, despite his own troubled history with women. He has floated the idea of a pardon for Kevin McAleenan, now his acting homeland security secretary, if he encountered any legal problems in shutting the southwestern border. And he has heightened his attacks on the press beyond his normal refrain of “fake news,” falsely claiming that journalists are “knowingly” bending the truth.Now, as Mr. Barr prepares to submit a redacted version of the report, Mr. Trump’s plan of attack, aides said, is to act as if the report itself is extraneous to Mr. Barr’s brief letter.“The bottom line: The result is no collusion, no obstruction, and that’s the way it is,” the president told reporters on Thursday. He said that Democrats “know it’s all a big scam, a big hoax” and that he believed what they were doing was “actually treason.” Days earlier, en route to Texas, Mr. Trump told reporters: “I don’t care about the Mueller report. I’ve been totally exonerated.”Mr. Trump is purposefully escalating his language, people who know him said, expressly to enliven his base of supporters and to enrage his political rivals and the news media. He has revived an idea that his administration rejected — sending immigrant detainees to so-called sanctuary cities — in part, people close to him said, to distract from the report.“The president clearly feels vindicated now that the Mueller report is completed,” said Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host, who recently taped a radio interview with Mr. Trump. “He will continue to remind the American people he was correct about there being no evidence of collusion with Russia.”Other outside surrogates have been echoing Mr. Trump’s line — that the narrative has already been established and it is too late for new facts to change that — even though members of the special counsel’s team have expressed concern that Mr. Barr’s letter did not accurately portray the contents of the report.“The facts are that there was no collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, no obstruction of justice and President Trump has been fully vindicated,” said Boris Epshteyn, a former White House aide who now serves as the chief political commentator for Sinclair Broadcast Group. “No amount of spin by the opponents is going to change that.”But critics said the strategy is classic Trump — effective with a narrow audience, but ultimately self-limiting. “He will probably have succeeded in setting the narrative for his core supporters and hardening their attitudes, but at the expense of anyone else believing him when the report comes out and inevitably undermines what he’s been claiming,” said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman under former President Barack Obama. “The same things that solidify his base just prevent him from expanding beyond it at all.”Neal K. Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, said that such an approach could backfire. “Whatever Trump may have thought when he claimed total exoneration two weeks ago, subsequent events strongly suggest that claim will fall flat on its face,” he said. “And because Trump claimed total exoneration from the report, he created massive public pressure for the full report to be released.”Inside the White House, there is only a bare-bones plan in place for how to handle the release of the redacted report, people familiar with the matter said. Emmet T. Flood, the White House counsel, is expected to spend the day reading the report and to brief the president on its findings.The White House has not asked to read the report in advance, and aides are planning to speed read. They intend to all but skip the sections related to potential criminal conspiracy, and instead zoom in on two outstanding questions that Mr. Trump himself wants to ignore: why Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, was not able to conclude whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, and what the attorney general meant when he wrote in his letter that “much” of the president’s conduct was public — meaning some of it was not.But many acknowledge they are still operating largely in the dark, with guesswork about what the report will reveal about Mr. Trump’s behavior in office.Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, would not disclose how the legal team plans to address the report, but he said it would be similar to how the White House responded after Mr. Barr sent his summary to Congress.“Our goal is to respond as quick as we can; given the length of the report, it may take some time to respond,” Mr. Sekulow said. “But we have a plan in place to respond in a professional manner as quickly and appropriately as possible.”Mr. Trump’s top aides and some relatives have also been eager for their own vindication. After months of being mocked by reporters for his seemingly off-script moments, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers, recently texted an article in The Federalist titled “Rudy Giuliani Knew Exactly What He Was Doing” to a wide list of journalists.Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, who was believed to have been a focus of investigators, made a rare appearance on Fox News last week and insisted he never had any real concern.“I was never worried, because I never thought the notion that we did that,” Mr. Kushner said, referring to whether the campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. “We ran a great campaign. The president had a great message, and that’s why we won.”Mr. Kushner, who faced difficulties getting a security clearance and was ultimately granted one on the president’s orders, added, “Over the last few years that I’ve been here, I’ve been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false.”The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” reinforced the idea that Mr. Trump has been emboldened by Mr. Barr’s summary, pushing back when the show’s host, Chris Wallace, asked, “How are you going to deal with some evidence that’s going to come out in this report that clearly is going to be damaging to the president?”“I don’t think it is going to be damaging,” Ms. Sanders said. “We consider this to be case closed.”Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Barr to Release Redacted Mueller Report Within a WeekAdvertisementSupported byBarr to Release Redacted Mueller Report Within a WeekBy The Associated PressApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday he expects to release a redacted version of the special counsel's Trump-Russia investigation report "within a week."Barr told members of Congress at his first public appearance since receiving special counsel Robert Mueller's report that his earlier projection of releasing a version by mid-April still stood. The report, which is nearly 400 pages long, is being scoured now to remove grand jury information and details that relate to pending investigations.Democrats scolded Barr over his handling of the report, telling him they were concerned that a summary of its main conclusions he released last month portrayed the investigation's findings in an overly favorable way for President Donald Trump.Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she was taken aback that Barr had reduced Mueller's report to a four-page letter in just two days. That letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates, and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice."Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive," Lowey said.Explaining the rapid turnaround for his letter, Barr said, "The thinking of the special counsel was not a mystery to the Department of Justice prior to the submission of the report."Barr was summoned to Congress to talk about his department's budget request, but lawmakers still asked about the Mueller report as they waited to see it. Barr's prepared remarks, sent to the committee on Monday, focused on funding requests for immigration enforcement and the fights against violent crime and opioid addiction, not mentioning the special counsel's report at all.Mueller sent his final report to Barr on March 22, ending his almost two-year investigation into possible ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Barr released a four-page letter summarizing the report two days later and said he would release a redacted version of the full report by mid-April, "if not sooner."The new attorney general's budget testimony — traditionally a dry affair, and often addressing the parochial concerns of lawmakers — came as Democrats were enraged that he was redacting material from the report and frustrated that his summary framed a narrative about Trump before they were able to see the full version. The Democrats are demanding that they see the full report and all its underlying evidence, though Trump and his Republican allies are pushing back.The chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee, Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York, told Barr there were "serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report."Barr said in the summary released last month that Mueller didn't find a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin. He also said that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, instead presenting evidence on both sides of the question. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the evidence was insufficient to establish obstruction.Facing the intensifying concerns from Democrats that he may have whitewashed Mueller's findings, Barr has twice moved to defend, or at least explain, his handling of the process since receiving the special counsel's report. He has said that he did not intend for his four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions to be an "exhaustive recounting" of his work and that he could not immediately release the entire report because it included grand jury material and other sensitive information that needed to be redacted.He is likely to be asked to further explain himself at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday that is also on the budget.Barr is to testify on the report itself at separate hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary committees on May 1 and May 2. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary panel, confirmed the May 2 date on Twitter and said he would like Mueller to testify.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said he would be satisfied hearing only from Barr and not Mueller.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsHints, but No Proof of Crime, in Mueller's Hunt for a Trump-Russia Conspiracy - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Hints, but No Proof of Crime, in Mueller's Hunt for a Trump-Russia ConspiracyAdvertisementSupported byHints, but No Proof of Crime, in Mueller's Hunt for a Trump-Russia ConspiracyBy ReutersApril 14, 2019NEW YORK/WASHINGTON — As recently as February, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team dropped hints that the inquiry into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election might unearth evidence of active cooperation between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign.That turned out not to be the case, according to Attorney General William Barr, who has said he hopes to release Mueller's nearly 400 page report this week. Barr told U.S. lawmakers on March 24 that the special counsel investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."To be sure, the investigation documented numerous contacts between Trump campaign figures and Russia, a willingness on the part of the campaign to accept help from Moscow, and no indication that the campaign told the Kremlin to keep out of an American presidential race.No criminal conspiracy was documented, according to Barr. But court statements by members of Mueller's team and evidence disclosed in various prosecutions by the special counsel had suggested on several occasions during the 22-month investigation that they were investigating a possible conspiracy.Frank Montoya, a former senior FBI official with extensive experience in counterintelligence investigations, said the words "did not establish" are commonly used in national security cases as language merely ruling out a chargeable offense."It doesn't mean a subject is innocent. It means investigators didn't find enough evidence to charge a crime," Montoya said.A recent indication that the special counsel was investigating a Trump-Russia conspiracy came on Feb. 4 during a closed-door court hearing in Washington. Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said Mueller was still investigating interactions between former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his Russian business partner Konstantin Kilimnik as critical to the inquiry."This goes to the larger view of what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is," Weissmann said, according to a transcript released days later. "This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating."Mueller's team said Manafort shared political polling data from the campaign with Kilimnik, who the special counsel has said had ties to Russian intelligence. The two also discussed proposals for a Ukrainian client to solve the Crimea conflict in a Kremlin-friendly way, Mueller said.Three weeks after Weissmann made his comments, Mueller's office backtracked. It said in a court filing it needed to correct its assertions about Manafort's interactions with Kilimnik. Partially redacted court filings indicated the correction may relate to the polling data.When Mueller's report is released - with parts blacked out by Barr to protect certain sensitive information - it is unclear how harsh a light it will shine on the contacts between Trump campaign figures and Russians. Those making contacts included the president's son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and campaign figures Manafort, Jeff Sessions, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia employed hacking and propaganda to sow division in the United States, harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump's candidacy. Moscow has denied election interference. A key event in the question of conspiracy was a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which Manafort, Kushner and Trump Jr. met with Kremlin-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had offered damaging information about Clinton. After being promised "dirt" on Clinton, Trump Jr. wrote in an email, "I love it."Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., declined to comment.Mueller charged 34 people and three Russian entities. He convicted or secured guilty pleas from Trump aides including Manafort, Flynn, Cohen and Papadopoulos, and charged Russian intelligence officers and a Russian "troll farm."Another avenue related to potential conspiracy was Mueller's pursuit of longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone, who had suggested he had a relationship with the WikiLeaks website and advance knowledge of its release of Democratic emails the special counsel said were stolen by Russians to hurt Clinton.But when Mueller indicted Stone in January, the seven criminal counts did not refer to conspiring with Russians and there was no allegation of close ties to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who separately was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion related to a 2010 hack of U.S. government computers.Mueller questioned more than a half dozen Stone associates to establish if he had acted as a go-between for the campaign with WikiLeaks. Two Stone associates who spoke to Reuters said Stone had struggled to make contact with Assange rather than having an inside track.Randy Credico, a New York comedian associated with Stone who appeared before Mueller's grand jury, is a case in point. Text messages between Stone and Credico seen by Reuters show Stone sought to use the comedian as an intermediary with Assange and urged Credico to feed WikiLeaks anti-Clinton research. Credico told Reuters he never made good on the request.Stone, who has been ordered by a judge not to talk about the case, is declining comment on the investigation.Mueller's investigation was aided by witnesses including Flynn, the former national security adviser who pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in 2016, and Samuel Patten, a political consultant and former Kilimnik business partner sentenced to probation on Friday after prosecutors credited him for assisting Mueller and other probes.It is unclear to what extent Mueller's inability to secure cooperation from others impeded him.A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.A judge found that Manafort, after agreeing to cooperate, repeatedly lied to prosecutors about interactions with Kilimnik and other matters, breaching a plea deal. Kilimnik, charged along with Manafort with conspiring to tamper with witnesses, was believed to be in Russia, out of reach.There also are witnesses like Papadopoulos, the first former Trump aide charged by Mueller who initially cooperated but became increasingly critical of the special counsel, especially after completing a two-week prison term in December.

"Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion."U.S. Attorney General William Barr has said he plans to make public a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 election by the middle of this month, if not sooner.On March 22, Mueller completed his 22-month probe and Barrsent a four-page letter to Congress two days later outlining the main findings. Barr told lawmakers the investigation did not establish that members of Trump's election campaign conspired with Russia, but also did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.Barr said he had concluded there was not enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction. But news media reports this week said members of Mueller's team were unhappy with the way Barr, a Trump appointee, had characterized the report's conclusions. Asked in an interview with Fox and Friends Weekend about calls for the release of the full confidential report, Trump said: “It’s really up to the attorney general, whatever he wants to do.” In another tweet, Trump called the report "a total waste of time."Barr did not meet a demand by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to provide the unredacted report to lawmakers by April 2.He told Congress in a letter last week he must redact material that was presented to a grand jury, as required by law, as well as information that could reveal U.S. intelligence agencies' sources and methods. Congressional Democrats have indicated they will fight those redactions in court if the subpoena is ignored. Russia's government has denied interfering in the U.S. election.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Trump Confidant Roger Stone Seeks Full Mueller ReportAdvertisementSupported byTrump Confidant Roger Stone Seeks Full Mueller ReportBy The Associated PressApril 12, 2019WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's longtime confidant, Roger Stone, asked a federal judge Friday to compel the Justice Department to turn over a full copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation as part of discovery in his criminal case.Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges he lied to Congress, engaged in witness tampering and obstructed a congressional investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In a court filing late Friday night, his lawyers said Stone is entitled to see the confidential report — which was submitted to the attorney general late last month — because it would help prove their allegation that there are constitutional issues with the investigation.In a separate action, a former aide to Stone who was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury asked a federal appeals court to determine whether he still needs to testify now that the Russia probe has concluded.Stone's team also filed motions Friday night arguing he was selectively prosecuted, challenging the constitutionality of Mueller's appointment and that the special counsel didn't have the ability to prosecute him for lying to Congress. They allege that Congress did not formally make a referral to the Justice Department about Stone's testimony and because of that, Mueller's investigation was "a violation of the separation of powers."In court documents, the lawyers argue they are entitled to a private disclosure of the nearly 400-page report that Mueller submitted to Attorney General William Barr late last month and said they "must be allowed to review the Report in its entirety because it contains the government's evidence and conclusions on matters essential to Stone's defense.""To be clear, Stone is not requesting the Report be disclosed to the world - only to his counsel so that it may aid in preparing his defense," the lawyers wrote.Stone, who is set to go on trial in November, has maintained his innocence and blasted the special counsel's investigation as politically motivated. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from conversations he had during the campaign about WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that released material stolen from Democratic groups, including Hillary Clinton's campaign.In a four-page letter to Congress that detailed Mueller's "principal conclusions," Barr said the special counsel did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates during the campaign, but did not reach a definitive conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. Instead, Mueller presented evidence on both sides of the obstruction question, but Barr said he did not believe the evidence was sufficient to prove that Trump had obstructed justice.Barr has said he expects to release a redacted version of Mueller's report next week that will be sent to Congress and made public.In the separate case, Andrew Miller, a former Stone aide, filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia over the subpoena he was issued in Mueller's investigation.Last year, Mueller's team sought Miller's testimony regarding Stone, WikiLeaks and the Russian government-controlled online persona Guccifer 2.0, which was used to release hacked material during the 2016 election. But Miller challenged his grand jury subpoena, arguing that Mueller's appointment was unconstitutional.Earlier this year a three-judge panel of the court upheld the special counsel's appointment and a contempt order intended to force Miller to testify.In the new petition, Miller's attorney, Paul Kamenar, argued that the matter now appears to be moot because Stone has been indicted and like "Cinderella's carriage that turned into a pumpkin at midnight, special counsel Mueller's authority expired."Kamenar is now asking the court to have the government formally say whether it will still pursue Miller's testimony. If that's the case, Kamenar is asking for a rehearing of the case. He said in a statement that he will take the fight to the Supreme Court if necessary.___Read the petition: http://apne.ws/rQRdegRAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsMueller Report Will Be Released Within a Week: U.S. Attorney General - The New York Times

"I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can."Tuesday's hearing came a little more than two weeks after Mueller wrapped up a 22-month-long probe into whether members of Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the White House race and if he obstructed official inquiries into the matter.The impending release of the 400-page report is expected to shed light on some of the more contentious episodes of Trump's election bid and presidency, including his firing of FBI head James Comey in 2017 and his campaign's contacts with Russians. The investigation, which Trump has repeatedly called a witch hunt, ensnared 34 people and three companies, including some members of Trump's inner circle such as his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In a March 24 letter to Congress, Barr said that Mueller's investigation did not establish that members of Trump's election campaign conspired with Russia. He also said that Mueller presented evidence "on both sides" about whether Trump obstructed justice, but he did not draw a conclusion one way or the other.Barr said that he reviewed Mueller's evidence and made his own determination that Trump should not face obstruction charges.The lack of details in Barr's letter, his decision not to charge Trump and his refusal to release the report in full without redactions has angered Democrats, who fear he may be sugar coating Mueller's findings.REDACTIONRedacted official documents or reports typically have sections blacked out to protect sensitive information. Barr gave no indication of how much of the report will be obscured but said he was working with Mueller on restricting details about secret grand jury information, U.S. intelligence gathering and ongoing criminal cases as well as potentially damaging information about peripheral players who were not charged in the Russia probe. To be transparent about what would be redacted, he told lawmakers he intends to "color code the excisions from the report" and provide "explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction."Barr left open the possibility that some members of Congress would be allowed to review secret information from the report in a safe setting."I can envision a situation where under appropriate safeguards, that information can be shared," Barr said. "I also think under appropriate safeguards, there is a way of people verifying these categories (of redactions) were not abused." Democrats repeatedly criticized Barr for his handling of the report, including taking it upon himself in the letter to decide that Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice.Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said Barr's letter summarizing the Mueller report appears to "cherry-pick from the report to draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president.""In many ways, your letter raises more questions than it answers," she added.The New York Times and the Washington Post reported last week that some investigators on Mueller's team were unhappy with the way Barr described their findings. The reports said that some of the evidence against Trump was more damning than Barr's letter indicated.Barr said he did not have insight into why some on Mueller's team were upset. "I suspect that they probably wanted more put out," he said.Barr said he did not offer to let Mueller help draft his four-page March 24 letter to Congress on the conclusions of the special counsel's investigation. Asked why, Barr said, "Because it was my letter."He said the White House did not review the letter to Congress laying out Mueller's findings before he sent it.Last week, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee prepared subpoenas that they plan to issue to the Justice Department if Barr does not agree to release the Mueller report in full.

Barr said he found insufficient evidence in Mueller's report to conclude that Trump committed obstruction of justice, though the special counsel did not make a formal finding one way or the other on that.The attorney general has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April, but has said portions will be blacked out to protect certain types of sensitive information.Here are five things to look for when the report is issued.OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE: WHY NO EXONERATION?Perhaps the biggest political risk for Trump is the special counsel's supporting evidence behind Mueller's assertion that while the report does not conclude the Republican president committed the crime of obstruction of justice it "also does not exonerate him" on that point.According to Barr's March 24 letter, Mueller has presented evidence on both sides of the question without concluding whether to prosecute. Barr filled that void by asserting there was no prosecutable case. But Barr's statement in the letter that "most" of Trump's actions that had raised questions about obstruction were "the subject of public reporting" suggested that some actions were not publicly known.Democrats in Congress do not believe Barr, a Trump appointee, should have the final say on the matter. While the prospect that the Democratic-led House of Representatives would begin the impeachment process to try to remove Trump from office appears to have receded, the House Judiciary Committee will be looking for any evidence relevant to ongoing probes into obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by the president or others in the administration.Barr's comment that most of what Mueller probed on obstruction has been publicly reported indicates that events like Trump's firing of James Comey as FBI director in May 2017 when the agency was heading the Russia inquiry are likely to be the focus of this section of the report.RUSSIAN 'INFORMATION WARFARE' AND CAMPAIGN CONTACTSThe report will detail indictments by Mueller of two Kremlin-backed operations to influence the 2016 election: one against a St. Petersburg-based troll farm called the Internet Research Agency accused of waging "information warfare" over social media; and the other charging Russian intelligence officers with hacking into Democratic Party servers and pilfering emails leaked to hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.With those two indictments already public and bearing no apparent link to the president, the focus may be on what Mueller concluded, if anything, about other incidents that involved contacts between Russians and people in Trump's orbit. That could include the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer promised "dirt" on Clinton to senior campaign officials, as well as a secret January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles investigated as a possible attempt to set up a back channel between the incoming Trump administration and the Kremlin while Democrat Barack Obama was still president.Any analysis of such contacts could shed light on why Mueller, according to Barr's summary, "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."MANAFORT, UKRAINE POLICY AND POLLING DATAIn the weeks before Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sentenced in March to 7-1/2 years in prison mostly for financial crimes related to millions of dollars he was paid by pro-Russia Ukrainian politicians, Mueller's team provided hints about what their pursuit of him was really about.Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told a judge in February that an Aug. 2, 2016 meeting between Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, a consultant Mueller has said has ties to Russian intelligence, "went to the heart of" the special counsel's investigation.The meeting included a discussion about a proposal to resolve the conflict in Ukraine in terms favorable to the Kremlin, an issue that has damaged Russia's relations with the West. Prosecutors also said Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with Kilimnik, although the significance of that act remains unclear. One focus will be on what Mueller ultimately concluded about Manafort's interactions with Kilimnik and whether a failed attempt to secure cooperation from Manafort, who was found by a judge to have lied to prosecutors in breach of a plea agreement, significantly impeded the special counsel's work.NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNSWhile Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy with Russia, according to Barr, there is a chance the report will detail behavior and financial entanglements that give fodder to critics who have said Trump has shown a pattern of deference to the Kremlin.One example of such an entanglement was the proposal to build a Trump tower in Moscow, a deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars that never materialized. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, admitted to lying to Congress about the project to provide cover because Trump on the campaign trail had denied any dealings with Russia.In the absence of criminal charges arising from Mueller's inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has shifted his focus to whether Trump is "compromised" by such entanglements, influencing his policy decisions and posing a risk to national security.Some legal experts have said the counterintelligence probe Mueller inherited from Comey may prove more significant than his criminal inquiry, though it is not clear to what degree counterintelligence findings will be included in the report. Barr also has said he planned to redact material related to intelligence-gathering sources and methods.MIDDLE EAST INFLUENCE AND OTHER PROBESAnother focus is whether Mueller will disclose anything from his inquiries into Middle Eastern efforts to influence Trump.One mystery is what, if anything, came of the special counsel's questioning of George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman and consultant to the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who started cooperating with Mueller last year.Nader attended the Seychelles meeting. He also was present at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2016, three months before the election, at which an Israeli social media specialist spoke with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., about how his firm Psy-Group, which employed several former Israeli intelligence officers, could help the Trump campaign, according to the New York Times. Mueller's interest in Nader suggested the special counsel looked into whether additional countries sought to influence the election and whether they did so in concert with Russia.A lawyer for Nader did not respond to a request for comment.Barr has said he will redact from the Mueller report information on "other ongoing matters," including inquiries referred to other offices in the Justice Department. That makes it unclear if any findings related to the Middle East will appear in the report.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|U.S. Lobbying Probes Persist Though Mueller Investigation OverAdvertisementSupported byU.S. Lobbying Probes Persist Though Mueller Investigation OverBy ReutersApril 12, 2019WASHINGTON — Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in U.S. politics is over, but prosecutors are investigating two prominent Washington lobbyists for their work for the former pro-Russian government of Ukraine, according to three sources close to the probe.In a sign that evidence from Mueller's 22-month investigation may yet ensnare more prominent Washington figures, federal prosecutors in Washington cited a former U.S. congressman "working for the government of Ukraine" in charges filed Thursday against former Obama administration official Greg Craig.Craig pleaded not guilty on Friday to lobbying violations and making false statements. The former congressman is not named in Craig's indictment, but other filings by his former law firm cite identical work done for the firm by Vin Weber, a lobbyist with Mercury Public Affairs, who was a U.S. representative from Minnesota from 1981 to 1993. Weber disclosed his work for a Ukrainian think tank, but he did not register as a foreign agent for the government of Ukraine under a the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which would have required him to spell out his activity in detail, according to a Reuters review of lobbying records.The Department of Justice is stepping up FARA enforcement after decades of inactivity. Mueller's investigation has not led to criminal conspiracy charges against Trump or his former associates, but it has exposed previously hidden foreign lobbying activity by some of Washington's most prominent lobbyists and prompted a flurry of new registrations since 2017. U.S. Attorney General William Barr is expected to release a redacted version of Mueller's findings next week.Three sources familiar with the investigation said federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining work done for Ukraine by both Weber and Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta, a top official of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 Democratic presidential campaign and a former White House adviser. A spokesperson for Weber and for Mercury declined to comment. Tony Podesta also declined to comment. The FARA crackdown has factored in cases against Craig, Craig's former law firm Skadden Arps and Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman now serving a 7-1/2 year prison sentence for lobbying and financial crimes.Other lobbyists have rushed to comply with the law. As of April, 446 separate entities registered with the Justice Department, up from 387 at the end of 2016. Tony Podesta disclosed his lobbying work for a Brussels-based think tank, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, to Congress. But he did not register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Ukraine.Podesta's work for the Ukrainian government came to light in 2017 after Mueller's team charged Manafort with lobbying violations. Those revelations prompted Podesta to step down in October 2017 from his Podesta Associates lobbying firm, which collapsed shortly after.Sources familiar with the investigation said that investigations into Ukraine-related lobbying by Craig, Podesta and Weber were all initially being pursued by the Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, but the probe related to Craig was transferred to federal prosecutors in Washington.Craig denies misleading the Justice Department about his activity in Ukraine, saying in a statement on Thursday that the effort to prosecute him was "unprecedented and unjustified." According to the indictment, Craig was hired to write a report for the Ukrainian Justice Ministry about the prosecution of former Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.Prosecutors say Craig concealed the fact that the project was largely funded by Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch who was close to Bill and Hillary Clinton but also donated to the Trump Foundation after Donald Trump made a September 2015 speech in Kiev.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|Explainer: What Might Be Blacked Out of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?AdvertisementSupported byExplainer: What Might Be Blacked Out of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?By ReutersApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has pledged to release next week Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign, albeit with color-coded redactions. While congressional Democrats have demanded the release of the full report with nothing blacked out, as well as the underlying evidence Mueller collected, Barr has said he will redact four categories of sensitive information.Barr told a congressional committee on Tuesday these redactions will be color-coded and accompanied by notes explaining the grounds for withholding information. It is unclear how much will be blacked out.According to a March 24 letter Barr sent to lawmakers, Mueller's nearly 400-page report presents evidence on both sides of the question of whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice, and while it "does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."Barr said in his letter that Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia. Barr also said that he as attorney general concluded that Mueller's evidence was "not sufficient" to establish that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice.Here is an explanation of the four categories of information that Barr has said will be redacted.GRAND JURY MATERIALIn the U.S. criminal justice system, prosecutors generally must get authorization from a group of citizens known as a grand jury before bringing criminal charges or issuing subpoenas. Grand juries meet in secret to ensure that people being investigated are not tipped off, while also protecting the privacy of potential criminal defendants who ultimately are not charged.Over the course of Mueller's investigation, which led to charges against 34 people and three Russian companies, his team used grand jury proceedings to issue more than 2,800 subpoenas and executed nearly 500 search warrants. A provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure called Rule 6(e) requires government lawyers to maintain the confidentiality of "matters" before grand juries, with some exceptions.This rule is unlikely to lead to many redactions in the part of the Mueller report dealing with whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice with actions aimed at impeding the inquiry. For that investigation, Mueller's team gathered evidence through voluntary FBI interviews with witnesses, which do not implicate grand jury secrecy rules.Mueller did use a grand jury to question associates of Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump who came under scrutiny due to his interactions with the Wikileaks website that published emails the special counsel has said were hacked by Russia to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In January, Mueller indicted Stone on charges including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering and making false statements. Stone has pleaded not guilty.Another key figure who testified before Mueller's grand jury was George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman involved in an effort to set up a back channel between the incoming Trump administration and the Kremlin while Barack Obama was still president, according to a Washington Post report.INFORMATION THAT COULD AFFECT ONGOING CASES Barr has said he will redact information that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions. "You'll recall that the special counsel did spin off a number of cases that are still being pursued," Barr told lawmakers. "And we want to make sure that none of the information in the report would impinge upon either the ability of the prosecutors to prosecute the cases, or the fairness to the defendants."Mueller's team has enlisted attorneys from other parts of the Justice Department, court records show, to jointly prosecute certain ongoing cases. These include: charges against Stone; witness-tampering charges against Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian associate of Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort; charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratic emails; and a Russian "troll farm" accused of flooding social media sites with propaganda to promote Trump and disparage Clinton.Separately, referrals by Mueller gave rise to inquiries by federal prosecutors in Washington, Virginia and New York. The New York referral related to Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and is due to report to prison for a three-year sentence in May. U.S. prosecutors in Virginia are investigating secret Turkish lobbying involving Michael Flynn, Trump's fired former national security adviser. In Washington, lobbyist Samuel Patten pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians and helping a pro-Russian Ukrainian businessman illegally purchase tickets to Trump's inauguration.Stone's trial is set to begin in November and Manafort has been hit with state charges in New York, so information about those two men could be redacted.'PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES'Barr has said he will redact "information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties." This is another way of articulating a long-standing Justice Department policy of not releasing disparaging information about a person unless the individual is indicted. The policy is grounded in the belief that people who are indicted can defend themselves in court, but people who are investigated without being charged do not have this opportunity.This policy has been dispensed with before, including in June 2016 when then-FBI Director James Comey publicly pronounced that Clinton had been "extremely careless" in handling classified information even though she was never charged.Some legal experts have said this policy should not apply to Mueller's report because it was primarily a counterintelligence operation, rather than a traditional criminal investigation. By focusing on the privacy rights of "peripheral" third parties, Barr may be signaling he will make an exception to the policy in order to allow information to remain unredacted concerning people who, while not charged with crimes, are central to the probe, potentially including Trump.INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING SOURCES AND METHODSIn investigating Russian election interference, Mueller's team may have relied on information from top-secret intelligence sources. Justice Department officials last year turned down a request by Republican lawmakers for certain information about Mueller's investigation, saying doing so could put lives at risk and expose the identity of a U.S. citizen who provided intelligence to the FBI. While redacting such material, Barr might opt to divulge it to certain lawmakers behind closed doors.

Russia's activities were an assault on U.S. democracy - "there is no doubt about that," Pelosi said. During two congressional hearings this week, Barr defended his handling of the 400-page report Mueller submitted to him on March 22 after a two-year investigation. It was the attorney general released a four-page letter to Congress providing a broad outline of its assessments.Barr said he would make public a redacted version of the report next week. Democrats have been calling for full disclosure.Barr, who was appointed by Trump, said on Wednesday he would look into whether U.S. agencies illegally spied on Trump's 2016 campaign, but acknowledged under sharp questioning by lawmakers that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.

"We have a right to see the information in the Mueller report."In Washington, the crowd was addressed by U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who won a committee vote on Wednesday allowing him to subpoena the attorney general for the full report."The Constitution gives Congress the power to take the appropriate action to hold the president accountable," the Democrat said. "To do our job we need the Mueller report."Barr, a Trump appointee, has made public what he described as the "principal conclusions" of Mueller's report. Mueller's team did not establish that Trump or his campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election, according to Barr's four-page summary, an accusation Trump and his associates have long denied. Mueller left unresolved in his report the question of whether Trump obstructed justice by impeding the Russia investigation. In his letter to Congress, Barr said he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had determined there was insufficient evidence to establish the president committed that offense.Russia's government has denied interfering in the U.S. election.Barr told Congress in a letter last week that he must redact material presented to a grand jury, as required by law, as well as information that could reveal U.S. intelligence agencies' sources and methods. Congressional Democrats have indicated they will fight those redactions in court if the subpoena is ignored.

"I have not read the Mueller report, I haven't seen the Mueller report. As far as I'm concerned I don't care about the Mueller report. I've been totally exonerated. No collusion, no obstruction," Trump told reporters at the White House. Barr told lawmakers at a hearing he intended to release "within a week" a redacted version of the long-awaited report, which Mueller submitted to Barr on March 22 after a 22-month investigation.The 400-page report is expected to shed light on some of the more contentious episodes of Trump's election bid and presidency, including his firing of FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and his campaign's contacts with Russians. In a March 24 letter to Congress, Barr said Mueller's investigation did not establish that members of Trump's presidential campaign had conspired with Russia. He said Mueller presented evidence "on both sides" about whether Trump obstructed justice, but did not draw a conclusion one way or the other.Barr said the White House did not review his letter to Congress laying out Mueller's findings before he sent it.

I've been telling you this all along.""We said from the start that this infamous commission of Mr Mueller's would not find anything because nobody knows this better than us. Russia did not meddle in any elections in the United States. There was no collusion, as Mr Mueller said, between Trump and Russia." Putin said the original allegations of collusion were "complete nonsense" that had been invented for domestic U.S. political consumption and as part of what he described as America's internal political struggle.The U.S. Attorney General told lawmakers on Tuesday that he intends to release the Mueller report to the public within a week.While the Mueller report cleared Trump of colluding with Russia it did not clear Moscow of trying to meddle in the 2016 vote. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere, with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord.When asked at the same event whether he wanted to see Trump re-elected next year, Putin declined to express a view, citing a long list of disagreements with the Trump administration and saying that the question of Trump's possible re-election was purely a matter for the American people.But Putin, who has praised Trump in the past, said he hoped Moscow and Washington would be able to work together to try to resolve their many differences on the international stage once what he described as the U.S. political crisis was over.Putin in July last year said he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election because Trump had spoken of wanting to repair U.S.-Russia relations.Overshadowed by the Mueller report and disagreements over everything from Syria to Ukraine, relations between Russia and the United States have in fact got worse under Trump.

DevelopingPresident Trump is likely to announce plans today for a future summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, in order to finalize a trade agreement.ImageAttorney General William Barr, who took office in February, is permitted to release as much of the special counsel’s report as he deems appropriate.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesAttorney general is said to have understated reportSome members of the special counsel’s team have said that Attorney General William Barr didn’t adequately portray their findings, which they said were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr has indicated, according to government officials and others familiar with the matter.Mr. Barr has released a four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report, which he said found no conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. Mr. Barr has said he will move to release the full report after scrubbing it of confidential information. The officials and others interviewed declined to provide more detail, and it is unclear how widespread the frustration is among Robert Mueller’s team, which included 19 lawyers, about 40 F.B.I. agents and other personnel.What’s at stake: The dispute — the first evidence of tension between Mr. Barr and the special counsel’s office — could determine who shapes the public’s initial understanding of the investigation.The Daily: In today’s episode, two reporters discuss the revelations about the Mueller report.

Since the crash in Ethiopia, airlines worldwide have grounded their 737 Max fleets.ImageChildren with measles in a government hospital in Manila in February.CreditFrancis R Malasig/EPA, via ShutterstockMeasles makes a comebackPublic health officials thought they had the disease under control. The United Nations intensified vaccination efforts in 2001, and cases plunged nearly 80 percent worldwide from 2000 to 2016.But two years ago, the number of cases began rising, even in countries where it had been vanquished. The biggest factor in that increase, according to the World Health Organization, was poverty. About 95 percent of a population must be immune to stop measles from spreading, but the medical systems of many countries are too weak to vaccinate enough children every year. Go deeper: Outbreaks in places such as Indonesia, Madagascar and Venezuela have revealed shortcomings in vaccination efforts and eroded confidence in what had been considered a public health achievement.ImageAt the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Ala.CreditWilliam Widmer for The New York Times“Common, cruel” violence in Alabama prisonsThe state has one of the highest incarceration rates in the U.S., and prisoners in its overcrowded and understaffed correctional system endure some of the highest rates of homicide and rape.A report issued by the Justice Department on Wednesday described “a high level of violence that is too common, cruel, of an unusual nature, and pervasive,” and said that the state was “deliberately indifferent” and “failed to correct known systemic deficiencies.” State officials said the report addressed issues that Alabama was aware of and already working to fix.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Explainer: Can Democratic Subpoenas Force the Release of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?AdvertisementSupported byExplainer: Can Democratic Subpoenas Force the Release of Mueller's Trump-Russia Report?By ReutersApril 8, 2019WASHINGTON — Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and President Donald Trump's actions related to the inquiry.The question is: how successful will they be?Attorney General William Barr, who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller's report to release, sent lawmakers a four-page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller's "principal conclusions" and has promised to release the nearly 400-page report by the middle of this month, with some parts blacked out, or "redacted."That has not satisfied Democrats, who control the House. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report, without redactions, as well as underlying evidence.Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort, important judicial precedents and Barr's rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential.CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH?Yes. Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary.If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material, the House could vote to hold him "in contempt" and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena. Legal experts said that process could take years. Barr's "principal conclusions" letter said Mueller's inquiry did not establish that Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction.The letter provided scant details of the findings, though Trump immediately claimed "complete and total exoneration." The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency. House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020.A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. In 2012, the House, then controlled by Republicans, subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales, dubbed "Fast and Furious." Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to comply. The House voted to hold him in contempt, marking the first time in U.S. history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president's Cabinet.The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office, with a settlement reached in 2018.WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT?Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making "redactions that are required" before releasing the Mueller report. He cited four reasons for redactions: protecting secret grand jury proceedings; safeguarding intelligence-gathering sources and methods; shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations; and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations.Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors. U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it.Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government.WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY?Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight.Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves "grave hostile acts of a foreign power" or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake.A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings.H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken "elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials." The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment. If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president's interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary's need for evidence.

Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, are related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.CreditCreditMark Wilson/Getty ImagesBy Kenneth P. VogelApril 10, 2019WASHINGTON — Lawyers for Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.The case against Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.An Ivy League-educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, Mr. Craig would become the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel’s investigation.Mr. Craig would also become the first person to be charged in a case connected to the special counsel after Mr. Mueller finished his investigation into the 2016 presidential election. In a summary of the inquiry, Attorney General William P. Barr said that the special counsel’s team had concluded that there was no evidence that President Trump or his aides “conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”The case against Mr. Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which the Justice Department is prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation.The law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians, and it has been the basis for charges brought against several people investigated by the special counsel.Mr. Craig’s lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act.Rather, they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012, while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.The work, on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, was linked to Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych.Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.Mr. Manafort arranged for Skadden Arps to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch, to assist the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. Specifically, Mr. Craig and his team produced a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych’s government of one of his rivals, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times, the Justice Department unit that oversees FARA reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only “in response to requests from the media,” according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.Prosecutors cast doubt on Mr. Craig’s claim in a settlement reached in January between the Justice Department and Skadden Arps. Under that settlement, the firm avoided prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.But the settlement did not exonerate Mr. Craig, and in fact it signaled that he was in prosecutors’ cross hairs. It quoted emails showing Mr. Craig reached out to a journalist to offer to provide the report and discuss it.Neither Mr. Craig nor the journalist are identified by name in the settlement. The journalist, David E. Sanger of The New York Times, is an author of the article in which Mr. Craig is quoted.Mr. Craig’s lawyers have argued that he was not required to register his work under FARA because he was not doing public relations for the Ukrainian government.In a statement on Wednesday, they said he “repeatedly refused requests that he participate in Ukraine’s media and lobbying campaign to promote the Tymoshenko Report.”Rather, they say he spoke to The Times to correct the Ukrainian Justice Ministry’s claims that the report cleared Mr. Yanukovych of accusations that he directed the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko for political purposes.The report “was critical of the Tymoshenko trial and caused unhappiness in the Ministry of Justice,” the lawyers said in their statement.Mr. Craig’s lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller’s team referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to FARA, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was moved in January to Washington.It is being handled by the United States attorney’s office in Washington, and the Justice Department’s National Security Division, which enforces FARA.Mr. Craig’s lawyers said in the statement, “We expect an indictment by the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office at the request of the National Security Division.” But they added, “Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government’s stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.”Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Obama Counsel Expects to Be Charged in Inquiry.

Cuban inmates had seized hostages inside an Alabama prison in a bid to avoid deportation, and now they were threatening to kill them. Only 19 days into his job as acting attorney general, Barr ordered the FBI to mount a rescue mission.Before dawn broke the next day, the hostages were freed and the prisoners subdued. Barr's gamble had paid off. Three months later, he was confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve as nation's youngest attorney general, the top U.S. law enforcement official.Barr, now 68, is "not afraid to make decisions that fall into his areas of responsibility," said George Terwilliger, who served as Barr's deputy during his first stint as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush.Barr is back atop the Justice Department, appointed by Donald Trump after the Republican president fired Jeff Sessions as attorney general in November.Barr is facing a different type of high-pressure situation as he determines how much of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's role in the 2016 election and contacts between Moscow and Trump's campaign should be made public. Department regulations give Barr broad authority to decide what to disclose and what to withhold.So far, all Barr has released since Mueller submitted the nearly 400-page report on March 22 is a four-page letter, made public two days later, describing the special counsel's main conclusions. Barr wrote that Mueller had not concluded that Trump's campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow. Barr also said he personally decided after reviewing the report that Mueller did not find enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice.That assessment has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats. In addition, some members of Mueller's team are spreading the word that they are unhappy with the way Barr characterized their work, according to media reports.The public is likely to get a greater look at the factors behind Barr's decision to clear Trump of obstruction of justice - Mueller had not exonerated Trump - and other investigative details when the attorney general releases a redacted version of the report, which he has promised by mid-April. For some, that will be too late, considering that all the public knows about the findings in a 22-month inquiry that cast a cloud over Trump's presidency is the little that Barr has already disclosed."It is like fundamentally rigging the game before we know what the actual score is," said Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, who worked with Barr on a telecommunications case in the 1990s. "His integrity, his history, his reputation is shattered by what he has done. I have no idea what could have motivated him." 'AN IMPRESSIVE EFFORT'Others have said Barr made the right decision on the obstruction question, noting that it is difficult to prove that Trump committed criminal obstruction if Mueller did not find that he destroyed evidence or directly interfered with the investigation - even though he assailed the inquiry as a "witch hunt" and called the investigators partisan zealots."Trump made an impressive effort at creating an obstruction case against himself, but it's no easy task to obstruct an investigation where prosecutors do not believe there's an underlying crime," George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said.Parts of the report are expected to be blacked out to protect information deemed sensitive. Barr, with Mueller's assistance, has spent weeks redacting material that might compromise ongoing investigations or intelligence-gathering sources and methods. Barr has said he is also removing material from grand-jury proceedings that by law can be made public only through a court order.Barr also may opt to redact portions that discuss people who were investigated but not charged such as Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. That would fit with longstanding Justice Department policy, but could draw criticism from Democrats who have said the public should know as much as possible about Trump campaign contacts with Russia during and after the 2016 election.Trump has said he will not use a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows a president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government, to block portions of the report. Barr has said he does not plan to submit the report to the White House for review. "Bill Barr is going to call it like he sees it," said Wayne Budd, who served as the Justice Department's third-ranking official during Barr's first stint as attorney general."I think he understands the role of the attorney general is not as a lawyer for the president," Budd added, "but as a lawyer for the people of the United States."

He refused to answer.The question came again, and again, and again, and then one last time. He still refused to answer.“I want us to have a serious relationship with the E.U.,” he said, gliding past the in-or-out question that has consumed Britons for the better part of three years.But now, with the Conservative government and Labour in talks to devise a deal they can both support, and with yet another deadline looming, Mr. Corbyn’s tightrope walk may be near an end.Until now, his studied ambiguity has largely held his party together while the Conservatives have crumbled. But having accepted Prime Minister Theresa May’s offer to negotiate, he will likely face uncomfortable choices if Mrs. May softens her stance and tries to tempt him with a credible compromise.“She’s dipping Jeremy Corbyn’s hands in the blood, if you like,” said Alan Wager, a research associate at The U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research organization. “That’s what Theresa May is aiming to do here.”The talks broke off on Friday, with Labour leaders demanding that Mrs. May show greater flexibility. They resumed Monday evening, and Downing Street said the parties would meet again Tuesday.But Mr. Corbyn had cautioned that to succeed the “talks have to mean a movement, and so far there’s been no change in those red lines.”The dilemma for Mr. Corbyn is evident.To satisfy Labour members, any agreement he reaches with the prime minister on the terms of Britain’s split from the European Union, or Brexit, will have to be accompanied by a public vote on the deal and an ironclad guarantee that it will not be altered by any successor to Mrs. May. Anything less would invite a tidal wave of anger from pro-European members of his party.ImageOpponents to Britain departing from the European Union demonstrating outside Parliament in London on Monday.CreditDaniel Leal-Olivas/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesYet, holding out for a second referendum would alienate a significant minority of Labour voters who support leaving the bloc — as well as Labour lawmakers who fear being seen as the party that thwarted Brexit.“The much more challenging phase he’s into now is making a positive decision in one direction or another and holding that coalition together as it moves from being against something to being in favor of something,” said Tom Kibasi, the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a liberal research organization.Whatever the outcome of cross-party talks, Mr. Corbyn’s apparent hope that Brexit would eventually fade away in favor of domestic issues looks increasingly misguided. Years of negotiation will follow even if a deal is reached, and there are already signs that voters who backed Labour in 2017 are defecting to smaller and more overtly anti-Brexit parties.Mrs. May made it more difficult to reach an agreement with Labour when she promised hard-liners in her party that she will resign once a deal is reached. That would leave any plan in the hands of her successor and make Mr. Corbyn the only party leader defending a largely unloved compromise in a future general election.That would be a difficult position for Mr. Corbyn, a left-wing outsider who is known better as a campaigner on social and economic issues than as a political tactician. His official preference has been to negotiate a soft Brexit deal that keeps Britain tied to European economic structures.“Corbynism depends on a moral claim to be above normal politics,” Glen O’Hara, a historian at Oxford Brookes University, said. “As soon you get your hands dirty with normal compromise, Corbynism fails.”The minimum requirement for a compromise would be Mrs. May agreeing to Labour’s demand that Britain remain in a European customs union. Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan, preserving reasonably frictionless trade in goods with the bloc, Britain’s biggest trading partner.But any such plan would be enshrined in a nonbinding part of Mrs. May’s Brexit deal, the so-called political declaration, meaning a successor to Mrs. May could try to undo it in favor of a more complete split from Europe.At the same time, Mrs. May faces a convulsion in her own party if she accedes to Labour’s demands, with hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers threatening new attempts to oust her.ImageThe Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, speaking in the House of Commons last week.CreditUK Parliamentary Recording Unit/EPA, via ShutterstockParliament on Monday night passed a bill requiring Mrs. May to seek an extension of the next Brexit deadline, on Friday, to avoid a no-deal exit. She had already asked European leaders for a delay until June 30, but lawmakers could try to force her to seek a longer postponement. Mrs. May planned to talk with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday and then to meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France to try to nail down their support for an extension.For Mr. Corbyn, the outlook is not exactly rosy. His favorability ratings are historically low, and he has been buffeted by new accusations that his party allies have dithered when people complain about anti-Semitic comments by Labour members.Only two months ago several Labour members of Parliament, angered by Mr. Corbyn’s equivocation over Brexit and his response to concerns about anti-Semitism, broke off to start their own group.That seemed to get Mr. Corbyn’s attention, and for the first time he backed a second public vote on Brexit, in some circumstances. Some analysts said this was out of character for Mr. Corbyn, a leader who made his reputation as an inflexibly left-wing backbench member of Parliament, but that it has paid dividends.“He’s been surprisingly flexible,” Mr. O’Hara, of Oxford Brookes University, said. “His team has managed to stay so indistinct, and talk to both sides of the debate for so long, just to let the government fall apart. Why would you let your enemy off the hook instead of letting them blow themselves up?”Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong skeptic of the European Union, has attracted deep suspicion from those who want to remain in the bloc, who make up the majority of Labour’s membership. But senior Labour officials have impressed upon Mr. Corbyn the political advantages of opposing Brexit and supporting a second public vote.The party’s pro-European faction is becoming increasingly confident that he will commit — if he does finally support any compromise — to their position.“I think what we’re seeing now is the walls are closing in on Corbyn,” said Lara Spirit, a founder of a campaign by young people for a second referendum. “There is just nothing in it for Corbyn to facilitate a Tory Brexit.”Mr. Kibasi, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said Mr. Corbyn’s Euroskepticism had proved to be a political boon, leaving him disentangled from the emotional attachments that might have led another party leader to step into the fray rather than let the Conservative party unravel.“He’s not clouded by affections for the E.U. or its institutions, and in a sense that gives him the ability to think clearly about the best ways to destabilize the government,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: After Years of Brexit Ambiguity, Labour Chief Is on the Spot.

And whatever overtures she makes to Labour, analysts said, she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal — a major sticking point in the cross-party talks.Mrs. May this week was expected to seek another delay to Britain’s departure from European leaders who have expressed anger at her reluctance to change strategy only days before they were to meet to consider her request. She is also trying to pressure Labour lawmakers who may be searching for an excuse to back a deal to avoid being seen as thwarting Brexit.Let me explain what's happening with Brexit.pic.twitter.com/gjGkvFk8fT— Theresa May (@theresa_may) April 7, 2019
But while Mrs. May appeared to soften her tone in a statement late Saturday, any compromise talks face an extremely challenging road ahead.“Presumably, there is some aspect of trying to convince the E.U. of her good faith in those talks,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. But he said the European leaders, now schooled in the stubborn realities of domestic British politics, were likely to see that a compromise between Mrs. May and Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, remained very far-off.ImageMrs. May in the House of Commons in London on Wednesday. On Saturday, she suggested a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal: regaining control over immigration from continental Europe.CreditMark Duffy/UK Parliament“The other game she’s playing,” Professor Bale said, “is to try to prove to everybody outside the country and inside the country that she’s genuinely tried, and therefore the only solution is to back her original deal.”That would most likely take the form of government efforts to allow Parliament to vote on a series of different Brexit plans, from her deal to softer proposals preferred by Labour lawmakers. Parliament has tried that before, only to find itself unable to give any plan a majority of votes. But Mrs. May has suggested she may try to restart the process and put the government’s weight behind whichever plan had the most support.Mrs. May had vowed for months that she would back only a Brexit plan that eventually took Britain out of Europe’s main economic structures, but on Saturday night she suggested that a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal: regaining control over immigration from continental Europe.That would open the door to a plan that met some of Labour’s demands, namely for Britain to remain in a European customs union. Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan, preventing the country from striking trade deals with other countries but also preserving reasonably frictionless trade with the bloc, Britain’s biggest trading partner.But government officials said on Sunday that any suggestions of openness to a customs union compromise were speculative. And while Labour leaders stressed that talks had been cordial and that both sides remained interested in seeking a compromise, they said the prime minister had not yet budged on substantive pieces of her deal.ImageTrucks at the Port of Dover in February. The prospect of high tariffs on European goods is one of the worries about a so-called hard Brexit.CreditToby Melville/Reuters“The sad thing is at the moment we haven’t seen overall any real changes to the deal,” Rebecca Long-Bailey, a senior Labour official who has been involved in the negotiations, said in a televised interview. “But we’re hopeful that that will change in coming days, and we’re willing to continue the talks, as we know the government are.”Cross-party talks between Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn stalled on Friday, and despite both sides saying they were willing to return to the table, neither the government nor Labour officials gave any indication on Sunday of a concrete schedule for further talks.British news media reports said Mrs. May had argued in talks with Labour that her original plan, while it did not explicitly keep Britain in the customs union, achieved the same goal by other means. Her plan has been voted down three times in Parliament.Mrs. May’s statement on Saturday appeared to be an effort to signal new openness to those talks, suggesting that a deal could be worked out so long as it ended free movement, the right of Europeans to work and travel throughout the bloc. Labour also formally supports ending free movement, though it has lately also supported plans that would preserve it.“The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree,” Mrs. May said. “We both want to end free movement, we both want to leave with a good deal, and we both want to protect jobs.”ImageDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, center left, last month with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk supports a one-year delay on Brexit.CreditSean Gallup/Getty ImagesMrs. May conceded that months of trying to convert hard-line anti-Europe Conservative lawmakers to her deal had failed.Mr. Corbyn is facing a swell of pressure from within his party to reject any compromise that does not include giving Britons a second public vote on leaving Europe with a deal or canceling Brexit altogether.That goes well beyond what Mrs. May said on Saturday that she was willing to consider.What awaits Mrs. May if she agrees to a compromise deal is perhaps an even bigger tremor in the Conservative Party. Some Conservative lawmakers have threatened new attempts to oust her if she allows Brexit to be delayed long enough that Britons are asked to vote in European Parliament elections in May. (Their options for how to remove her, though, are limited after an earlier attempt failed.)Reports in the British news media on Sunday said that Mrs. May was offering legal guarantees to protect Labour lawmakers from their biggest fear — that a staunch pro-Brexit successor to Mrs. May would rip up the parties’ compromise plan and embark on a much more complete split with Europe.(The move was described in The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, as the “Boris lock,” a nod to Boris Johnson, the extreme anti-Europe lawmaker who is angling to follow Mrs. May as prime minister and may be inclined to upend her plan.)ImageA pro-Brexit supporter in London last week. Mrs. May has conceded that efforts to convert hard-line anti-Europe Conservative lawmakers to her Brexit deal have failed.CreditDylan Martinez/ReutersBut the outlines of Britain’s future relationship with Europe, including a possible customs union, would be made in a nonbinding part of Mrs. May’s exit deal, making it difficult to protect from future attempts to derail it.Professor Bale, of Queen Mary University, said that while she might be trying to provide cover for Labour lawmakers already inclined to back her deal, there was little of substance she could offer them.“Any guarantees given to Labour on that score would not be worth the paper they’re written on,” he said.In the backdrop of Mrs. May’s efforts to temper her approach is a chorus of European leaders accusing Mrs. May of having so far failed to come up with a fresh plan to break months of Parliamentary stalemate.French officials went so far as to say that if Mrs. May failed to outline a new plan with “credible political backing,” they would treat it as a decision to greenlight a no-deal exit, a possibility that experts say would be disastrous for Britain’s economy.European leaders will meet on Wednesday to consider Mrs. May’s request for another delay to Brexit. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, whose country stands to be badly affected by a no-deal exit, said he expected European leaders to postpone Brexit to avert that outcome, however angry they might be about Britain’s conduct.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs. May a one-year extension for Brexit while keeping open the possibility of an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: May Offers to Compromise on Brexit, but Critics Say Her Word Isn’t a Bond.

The Times said the officials and other sources declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel's investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Barr explained.It was also not clear how widespread among Mueller's team, which included dozens of lawyers and investigators, are concerns about differences between Barr's summary and Mueller's report, the Times said.Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Barr, a Trump appointee, said in the summary that Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election.Barr also said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump.Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president, who has denied conspiring with Russians or obstructing justice.The attorney general has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods.The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to enable its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller's unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides, including political strategist Steve Bannon.

Barr testified on Wednesday that he would “see if I can work to accommodate” congressional requests for access to blacked-out parts of the Mueller report.CreditCreditMelissa Lyttle for The New York TimesBy Charlie Savage and Katie BennerApril 10, 2019WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr said on Wednesday that even after he released a partly blacked-out copy of the Mueller report, most likely next week, he would work to share with Congress some of the more sensitive information that he redacted.Mr. Barr also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that while he intends to black out derogatory information about “peripheral third parties,” he would not take out criticisms of public office holders, including President Trump.Democrats have attacked Mr. Barr for releasing only a four-page letter on March 24 with what he called the report’s “bottom-line findings”: that the evidence the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, gathered did not show any conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and that while the special counsel took no position on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice, Mr. Barr deemed him cleared.Lawmakers have demanded to see the unredacted report, a request Mr. Barr tried to address on Wednesday.“I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that,” Mr. Barr told the senators.His assurance did not mollify them. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told him that any attempt to hide pieces of the report would “only fuel suspicions that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump’s defense team.”Even while Mr. Barr sought to reassure lawmakers that he would treat the report in a transparent and fair manner, he also made a startling statement sure to please the president — that investigative steps by the F.B.I. in 2016 to understand links between the Trump campaign and Russia amounted to “spying” on Mr. Trump’s campaign, a portrayal law enforcement officials have vehemently denied.[Read about the attorney general’s assertion that intelligence agencies spied on the Trump campaign.]The attorney general was testifying about the Justice Department budget for the second straight day. But as happened on Tuesday, when he appeared before a House panel, questions about the Trump-Russia investigation led by Mr. Mueller and his still-secret full report dominated the hearing.Mr. Barr glancingly addressed a mystery raised by his March 24 letter, which did not explain why Mr. Mueller had rendered no judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice — a silence that left open possibilities, including that the special counsel had wanted Mr. Barr to make the call, and that Mr. Mueller had intended for Congress to receive the evidence without the department weighing in.On Wednesday, Mr. Barr said that he had talked to Mr. Mueller about why he made no conclusion, and that the special counsel had not mentioned either of those possibilities to him. But the attorney general hinted that the answer might be known soon, saying that Mr. Mueller “has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I’ll be making available hopefully next week.”Mr. Barr again declined to say whether he had recently briefed the White House on details of the report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.ImageJeffrey A. Rosen, whom President Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr’s deputy, had a confirmation hearing on Wednesday where he largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and the Mueller report.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesThe hearing also addressed criticism of the F.B.I.’s early decisions in 2016 to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s election-meddling operations that included scrutinizing any links between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign. The investigation, which Mr. Mueller took over the next spring, included assigning an informant to approach members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia and later obtaining a court order to wiretap a former Trump adviser with links to Russia after he left the campaign.During that part of the discussion, Mr. Barr used a startling word to describe those steps — he said he thought “spying” on the Trump campaign had occurred. But he later seemed to tone down that formulation, saying his concern was whether “illegal surveillance” had taken place that was not “adequately predicated” — and conceding that he had “no specific evidence that I would cite right now.”Responding to Mr. Barr’s testimony, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter: “These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I’ve asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report.”Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A. Rosen, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr’s deputy. Mr. Rosen, who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation, would succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller.Mr. Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report, saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts. But Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr. Mueller’s work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down, and she pressed Mr. Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference.“If I am confirmed,” Mr. Rosen replied, “I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences.”Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system, including the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to Mr. Trump.Separately, under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them.He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a “timeout” after 2020.In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The administration’s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.Mr. Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a “managerial” role in overseeing the drafting of the rule, such as by ensuring deadlines were met. But 11 people interviewed by The Times at the time of the negotiation said Mr. Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome.Mr. Rosen also addressed criticism that he — like Mr. Barr and Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division — had no prosecutorial experience.He noted that the department had many experienced prosecutors, and said, “I would make it my job to utilize and leverage the expertise they bring to bear while combining that with my own experience and judgment.”Coral Davenport contributed reporting.

Craig stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.CreditCreditCharles Dharapak/Associated PressBy Kenneth P. Vogel and Katie BennerApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — In an indictment that seized the attention of the capital’s K Street lobbying corridor, Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, was charged on Thursday with lying to the Justice Department and concealing information about work he did in 2012 for the government of Ukraine.The indictment of Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The charges represented a continuation — and an expansion — of a new focus on a long-neglected law governing foreign influence operations in the United States, which the Justice Department has begun prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation.Mr. Craig, in a video posted on YouTube on Thursday night, called the charges against him “unprecedented and unjustified,” and expressed confidence “that both the judge and the jury will agree with me.”[Read the indictment.]The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, had been the basis for charges brought against several people who had been investigated by the special counsel. The 1938 law requires Americans to register with the Justice Department when they lobby or do public relations in the United States for foreign politicians, parties or governments.Before Mr. Craig’s indictment, the recent charges brought in cases initiated by Mr. Mueller had accused people of failing to disclose their lobbying work.The charges against Mr. Craig, on the other hand, stem from public relations, rather than lobbying. While Mr. Craig was not charged with failing to register under the law, the indictment accuses him of lying to, and withholding information from, the Justice Department officials who oversee FARA in order to avoid registration.Before the indictment, Mr. Craig’s lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller’s team had referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to foreign lobbying laws, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was moved in January to Washington.“Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration,” Mr. Craig’s lawyers, William Taylor and William Murphy, said in a statement on Thursday, referring to the part of the Justice Department that oversees the law. “That is what this trial will be all about.”The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.By Thursday afternoon, the indictment and its implications were a hot topic for Washington’s lucrative lobbying and communications consulting industry.The charges will prompt even more diligent review of possible compliance obligations by consultants who represent foreign clients, said Thomas J. Spulak, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm who advises on lobbying compliance.“It’s pretty significant,” he said. “It’s not just trying to influence the government; it’s trying to influence the American public.” He added, of Mr. Craig’s case, “If they can establish the facts, then I think it’s a pretty serious violation.”Mr. Craig’s indictment also attracted notice because he is the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel’s investigation. An Ivy League-educated lawyer, Mr. Craig held prominent positions in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.The charges “undermine the narrative of President Trump and congressional Republicans that the Mueller probe was a Democratic witch hunt meant to bring down Trump and the G.O.P.,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.The indictment said Mr. Craig “did not want to register as an agent for the government of Ukraine” partly because he believed doing so would make it less likely that he and others at his firm at the time, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, would be appointed to federal government posts. Mr. Obama had put rules in place restricting the work that former lobbyists could do in his administration.The indictment said Mr. Craig also wanted to hide the identity of the Ukrainian oligarch who paid $4 million to fund the overwhelming majority of the fees received by Skadden Arps for the Ukraine work.In his YouTube video, Mr. Craig identified the oligarch as Viktor Pinchuk, a steel magnate who has portrayed himself as pro-Western, and who has donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, as well as $150,000 to Mr. Trump’s since-shuttered charitable foundation.Mr. Pinchuk’s representatives have said that “he had no connection to the project either professionally or personally” and “was not the source of any funds used to pay fees of Skadden in producing the report.”The work was done on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, and consisted primarily of producing a report on the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych’s government of one of his rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. The Skadden Arps team also agreed to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.The work was steered to Mr. Craig and his firm by Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych. Mr. Manafort intended to use the report to quell Western criticism of Mr. Yanukovych.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller’s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.Mr. Craig is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday.In his video statement, Mr. Craig said his team at Skadden Arps “researched the requirements for registration under FARA and agreed that the law firm did not need to register.” He also said that the report the team produced “was critical of important aspects of the trial, which we found to be flawed.”After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times, the Justice Department reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was required to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only “in response to requests from the media,” according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.In the indictment, prosecutors presented evidence that Mr. Craig did reach out to The Times and was involved in the media rollout strategy for the report.A spokeswoman for The Times said, “To date, we have not received a subpoena in the investigation and have not provided information to the government.”Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.Skadden Arps reached a settlement in January with the Justice Department that allowed the firm to avoid prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.Taken together, the indictment of Mr. Craig and the settlement with Skadden Arps suggest that the Justice Department is trying to “make an example of this prominent lawyer and law firm so that parties receiving D.O.J. inquiries in the future will take them more seriously,” said Matthew Sanderson, who advises clients on compliance with FARA and other lobbying laws for the firm Caplin & Drysdale.“In the past, the department would send letters of inquiry to organizations that would receive only a cursory response or be disregarded altogether,” he said. “That, apparently, will no longer be tolerated.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Obama Aide Indicted in Case Linked to Mueller Report.

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• Some of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators believe Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry, which they say were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated. They’re worried that Americans’ views will have hardened before the investigation’s conclusions become public.• The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee formally requested six years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns, likely starting a momentous court fight.• A nonbinding resolution approved by the House calls for the Trump administration to drop its support for a court ruling that declared the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.• Senate Republicans used the so-called nuclear option to unilaterally change years-old rules of the chamber with a simple-majority vote. They did it to speed up the confirmation of Trump nominees.• A coalition of states and advocacy organizations sued the Trump administration over the rollback of Obama-era nutritional standards for school meals.• The arrest of a Chinese woman who brought a malware-laced device into Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida has exposed the challenge of protecting a president who spends much of his time at a busy resort.• On Election Day in 2016, the Republican Party was split over its nominee for president. Not anymore: In every state important to the 2020 race, Mr. Trump’s allies are in firm control of the Republican electoral machinery.• Joe Biden, trying to stem the damage from complaints about unwanted touching as he considers a presidential run, said in a video that he realized that “social norms have begun to change.”• Beto O’Rourke’s 2020 campaign raised $9.4 million in 18 days. The total is smaller than those of Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, but Mr. O’Rourke only joined the presidential race in mid-March.• In a rare speech to a joint session of Congress, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, stressed the importance of the military alliance and the need to stand up to Russia.• The Trump administration is preparing an economic relief package for Venezuela in the event that the Maduro government falls. The legislation would provide $200 million in aid for Venezuela and $200 million for neighboring countries taking in Venezuelan refugees._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|Ex-Obama Lawyer Craig Charged in Mueller Spin-Off Probe for Lying About Ukraine WorkAdvertisementSupported byEx-Obama Lawyer Craig Charged in Mueller Spin-Off Probe for Lying About Ukraine WorkBy ReutersApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — Greg Craig, who served as former President Barack Obama's top White House lawyer, was charged on Thursday with lying about work he performed in 2012 for Ukraine in a case that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.Craig, 74, faces up to 10 years in prison for charges of making false statements and violating a lobbying law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). He is accused of lying to the Justice Department about his work after he left the White House on a legal review that largely vindicated the prosecution of a political enemy of Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-aligned president of Ukraine at the time.Craig said in a statement he headed a team of lawyers that worked on an independent report for Ukraine's justice ministry. After researching FARA requirements, they found they did not need to register as foreign agents under the law."This prosecution is unprecedented and unjustified. I am confident that both the judge and the jury will agree with me," Craig said.Craig's lawyers indicated he would plead not guilty. He is scheduled to appear in the U.S. District Court in Washington on Friday.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the New York law firm that produced the report, agreed in January to turn over the $4.6 million it was paid and retroactively register as a foreign agent, as part of a settlement with the Justice Department.Skadden produced the 187-page report at the behest of Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who is currently serving a 7 1/2-year prison sentence for lobbying violations and financial crimes.Manafort was apparently happy with Craig's work. "You are 'THE MAN,'" he wrote Craig in an email after the report received favorable media coverage, according to the indictment.The report was meant to be an objective review of the Ukrainian government's prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, the country's former prime minister who was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison.It criticized Tymoshenko's behavior during the trial and concluded that her due-process rights had not been violated, but also said that she had been improperly imprisoned during the trial.The report was used by Yanukovych's government to justify Tymoshenko's pretrial detention to the European Court of Human Rights and influence U.S. lawmakers. Yanukovych was one of Manafort's main lobbying clients.FUNDED BY UKRAINIAN BILLIONAIREAccording to the indictment, Craig covered up aspects of his work in order to avoid registering as a foreign agent under FARA, a rarely enforced law that was enacted in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda.Had Craig complied with the law, he would have been forced to reveal that funding for the report largely came from Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire. Pinchuk paid the firm $4 million for its work, according to Skadden filings made as part of its settlement.The Ukrainian government only paid Skadden $12,000 - an amount so low that it aroused suspicion in Ukrainian media.Craig also failed to disclose that Skadden was simultaneously helping out with Tymoshenko's prosecution on other charges, prosecutors say. "That would do enormous damage to the credibility" of the report, Craig wrote in an email to other Skadden attorneys, according to the indictment.Craig privately had reservations about Tymoshenko's treatment but left them out of the report, the indictment said."Evidence of criminal intent - i.e., that she intended to commit a crime - is virtually non-existent," he wrote in a memorandum that was not included in the report, according to the charges.During his tenure as Obama's White House counsel from January 2009 to January 2010, Craig led the administration's unsuccessful effort to shut down the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He also represented former President Bill Clinton during his 1998 Senate impeachment trial. Another Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty last year to lying to investigators about the report. Craig's case stems from Mueller's 22-month investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election.That probe led to charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former key Trump allies, but Attorney General William Barr said last month that Mueller did not find enough evidence to charge Trump or others with criminal conspiracy.Barr also said he decided there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. He is expected to release a redacted version of Mueller's final report to Congress next week. (Additional reporting by Sarah N.

The original March 29 deadline had been extended once, to April 12 — one week away.Commenting on the negotiations so far between Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Labour’s lead lawmaker on Brexit, said the government was so far not allowing “any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration,” the part of Mrs. May’s deal that outlines Britain’s future relationship with Europe and that would be the centerpiece of any compromise.He said talks would continue only if the government changed its position.“So far, the government isn’t proposing any changes to the deal,” Mr. Starmer told reporters on Friday. “We want the talks to continue and we’ve written in those terms to the government, but we do need change if we’re going to compromise.”What Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.A minister in Mrs. May’s government, Rory Stewart, said the government was prepared to compromise on the political declaration, saying the negotiations with Labour had run into problems but were not dead.“In truth, the positions of the two parties are very, very close and where there’s good will it should be possible to get this done and get it done relatively quickly,” Mr. Stewart said in an interview on BBC Radio 4.In a statement, Downing Street said, “We have made serious proposals in talks this week, and are prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides.”No further talks were scheduled, a Labour official said, but the party was willing to reopen negotiations if the government’s position changed.After seeing her Brexit deal rejected three times by Parliament, Mrs. May earlier this week sought to break months of deadlock by meeting with Mr. Corbyn.Mrs. May’s plan was to eventually take Britain out of Europe’s main economic structures but give it control over immigration from continental Europe.Mr. Corbyn has been reluctant to be pinned down on a single alternate plan, but Labour’s policy is to keep Britain more closely tied to European regulations and leave the door open to a second public vote on Brexit.ImagePro-Brexit protesters outside the Parliament in London.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersOne of the compromise plans that has been most popular in Parliament is Britain’s agreeing to remain in the European customs union, meaning it would not charge tariffs on European products.But Mrs. May would risk a rebellion of hard-line, pro-Brexit lawmakers in her Conservative Party if she accepts a compromise that keeps Britain tied closely to Europe.Meanwhile, a compromise would force Mr. Corbyn to face the wrath of pro-European lawmakers in Labour, who want nothing less than another public vote that could reverse Brexit altogether.Mrs. May already seemed to be contemplating difficulties in talks when she wrote on Friday morning to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, asking to again delay Britain’s departure from the bloc.She said in the letter that if talks with Mr. Corbyn did not produce a compromise, she would hold a series of votes in Parliament on alternative paths, in the hopes that lawmakers would settle on one.Parliament has already tested support among lawmakers for various plans, only for none to win a majority. But the government is expected to try to use a somewhat different voting process, were it to try again.“This impasse cannot be allowed to continue,” Mrs. May wrote. “In the U.K. it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics, while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future.”ImageDonald Tusk, center-left, president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, center-right, president of the European Commission, in Brussels last month.CreditJohn Thys/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMrs. May also conceded in the letter that Britain was preparing to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May.Analysts said Brussels would probably reject her proposed date of June 30 for a Brexit postponement — and some countries said they had yet to see a sufficient reason to support any extension.Britain was originally scheduled to leave the bloc on March 29, but European leaders granted a short extension to give Parliament more time to approve a withdrawal deal.Mr. Tusk was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs. May a one-year extension for Brexit while leaving the door open to an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal, according to a senior European Union official familiar with his thinking. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, in keeping with standard practice.That plan, described as a “flextension,” would eliminate the need for European leaders to repeatedly consider British requests for a delay. And in allowing Britain to leave sooner if an agreement is reached, Mr. Tusk appears to be trying to make it clear that Brussels is not trying to trap Britain in the bloc.Mr. Tusk’s plan would still need the backing of European Union member states, and there were some signs of resistance from France, which typically takes the hardest line in these matters, as well as Austria and the Netherlands.“The French president has made very clear that if we want to grant an extension: What for?” the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said before a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest, Romania, on Friday. He added, “It is up to the British government to give an answer to that key question.”ImageIn a Twitter post, Jacob Rees-Mogg, center, recommended that, if “stuck” in the European Parliament over the next year, Britain should be “as difficult as possible.”CreditFacundo Arrizabalaga/EPA, via ShutterstockThe cross-party talks had been cited by some as reason enough for the bloc to offer an extension. Further difficulties in the talks throw that into question, and any new extension may depend on what Parliament manages to accomplish next week.The Netherlands has generally been more sympathetic to Britain, but Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, expressed exasperation with the British negotiating approach. “I keep being amazed at how the fifth economy of the world handles its interests,” he said.In asking for an extension until June 30, Mrs. May was bowing to pressure from within her Conservative Party not to be seen as forcing the country into a longer delay.But she was also laying the ground for a more protracted extension by agreeing that Britain was prepared to participate in European elections in May. That was seen in Brussels as a condition for another Brexit postponement.Those moves have not gone over well with hard-line Brexit supporters. That rancor was reflected in a Twitter post on Wednesday by the lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, who recommended that, if “stuck” in the European Parliament over the next year that Britain be “as difficult as possible.”The Labour Party received a glimmer of good news in a by-election in South Wales, retaining a traditional Labour seat in an area that had backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum.But amid low turnout, the margin was relatively slim, with the winner, Ruth Jones, receiving 39.5 percent of the vote, compared with 31 percent for the Conservatives and 9 percent for the rejuvenated far-right U.K. Independence Party.Milan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.

Barr said that he believed President Trump’s 2016 campaign was spied on by the government and that he wanted to ensure that there was no “improper surveillance.”CreditCreditMelissa Lyttle for The New York TimesBy Charlie Savage, Nicholas Fandos and Katie BennerApril 10, 2019• Attorney General William P. Barr, appearing before Congress for a second straight day on Wednesday, said the government spied on the Trump campaign and said he would look into whether any rules were violated.• Mr. Barr signaled he was open to sharing more information with lawmakers about the redacted Mueller report than is released to the public and that he “hoped” to make it public “next week.”• Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the nomination of Jeffrey A. Rosen, President Trump’s nominee to succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed and oversaw the special counsel, as deputy attorney general.Barr will review potential “spying” on the Trump campaign.With the Russia investigation complete, Mr. Barr said he was preparing to review “both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign,” including possible improper “spying” by American intelligence agencies.“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Mr. Barr said, adding that he believed “spying did occur.” Mr. Trump and his allies have accused the F.B.I. and other government officials of abusing their power and cooking up the Russia investigation to sabotage the president.“I am not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at them,” Mr. Barr said. Later he said he wanted to ensure that there was no “improper surveillance” — not suggesting there had been, but that the possibility warranted review.It was not immediately clear what Mr. Barr was referring to, and he did not present evidence to back up his statement. The F.B.I. obtained a secret surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, after he left the campaign, and reports have suggested it used at least one confidential informer to collect information on campaign associates.Mr. Barr said that he will work with the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, to examine the origins of the bureau’s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and that he would soon set up a team for that effort. He noted that Congress and the Justice Department’s inspector general have already completed investigations of that matter, and that after reviewing those investigations he would be able to see whether there were any “remaining questions to be addressed.”Barr gave up a few more details about Mueller’s report.Under intense questioning from Democratic senators, Mr. Barr further pulled back the curtain on the Justice Department’s handling of the special counsel investigation, though only by a few inches.Mr. Barr shed some additional light on Mr. Mueller’s decision not to reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr. Trump criminally obstructed the investigation and his own decision to conclude in his letter to Congress delivering the investigation’s conclusions last month that the evidence did not meet that bar.Mr. Barr said he had spoken with Mr. Mueller about why he did not reach a decision on obstruction of justice, but declined to offer details of their conversations. The attorney general said that Mr. Mueller did not explicitly ask that Congress be allowed to judge the evidence and decide for itself, nor did he say that the attorney general should.“But that is generally how the Department of Justice works,” Mr. Barr said, saying that the department’s job is to make prosecutorial decisions — and he had.“I am looking forward to explaining my decision that I briefly outlined in the March 24 letter, but I don’t think I can do it until the report is out,” he said.The redacted Mueller report may be released “next week,” Barr says.On the timing of the redacted report’s release, Mr. Barr said Wednesday that he “hoped” to make it public “next week.” The answer differed slightly from what he told House lawmakers on Tuesday, that he intended to put out the report “within a week.”He said Justice Department lawyers and members of Mr. Mueller’s team, who are reviewing the report for sensitive information to black out before release, would not remove information that would harm the “reputational interests” of Mr. Trump. Mr. Barr also said that he had not overruled Mr. Mueller’s team on any proposed redactions from the Mueller report, and had not discussed with the White House what he was blacking out.Barr is willing to work with Congress on redacted information.Democrats in the House have slammed Mr. Barr for what they view as his refusal to share the investigation’s underlying evidence and material he may redact from the report. But Mr. Barr told senators on Wednesday he would be willing to re-evaluate that decision to try to accommodate lawmakers’ concerns.“I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that,” he said.Democratic lawmakers argue that they need such material so they can fully understand the implications of Mr. Mueller’s findings and judge whether or not Mr. Barr had fairly represented what was found. In the House, they have already approved a subpoena to issue to try to compel the release of this kind of information.Barr again refused to say if he had briefed the White House.Mr. Barr again declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the fuller Mueller report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.His refusal to say one way or the other raised the possibility that since then, the Justice Department may have briefed Mr. Trump or his inner circle about its contents.“I’m landing the plane right now,” Mr. Barr said under Democratic questioning. “I have been willing to discuss my letter and the process going forward. The report is going to be out next week and I’m not just going into the details of the process.”Trump says there is nothing to clear up: “I won.”Interest in the report remains intense among congressional lawmakers. President Trump, not so much.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday, the president slammed the investigation as an illegal “attempted coup.” But he said he had “won” and could care less about the report itself.“I have not seen the Mueller report,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I have not read the Mueller report. I won. No collusion, no obstruction. I won. Everybody knows I won.”He continued: “As far as I’m concerned I don’t care about the Mueller report. I’ve been totally exonerated.”The report, which runs nearly 400 pages, is likely to be less black and white. Mr. Barr has said Mr. Mueller did not find the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to undermine the 2016 election, but he has said that the special counsel’s team did not reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr. Trump criminally obstructed the investigation. Mr. Barr, assessing the evidence for himself, concluded the evidence did not meet that bar.Rosen vows to keep politics from improperly influencing his decisionsMeanwhile, at the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Mr. Rosen, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pressed the nominee to commit to allowing all pending criminal matters related to the special counsel’s investigation to proceed without improper political interference.“If I am confirmed, I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences,” Mr. Rosen replied.Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system. But Mr. Mueller’s office obtained the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, and is handing that matter off to regular prosecutors to bring to trial. The Mueller team also investigated other matters, like the finances of the Trump inauguration committee, which continue to be investigated elsewhere.Rosen defends his role in the Trump administration’s fuel efficiency proposalUnder questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in crafting a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them.He also said the issue was how to implement a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a “time out” after 2020.In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, already require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The Trump administration’s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.Mr. Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a “managerial” role in overseeing the crafting of the rule, such as by ensuring deadlines were met. But 11 people interviewed by The New York Times at the time of the negotiation said that Mr. Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome.Coral Davenport contributed reporting.

The indictment unsealed Thursday makes no mention of the central role WikiLeaks played in the Russian campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.CreditCreditChet Strange for The New York TimesBy Mark Mazzetti and Julian E. BarnesApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — In June 2016, five months before the American presidential election, Julian Assange made a bold prediction during a little-noticed interview with a British television show.“WikiLeaks has a very big year ahead,” he said, just seconds after announcing that the website he founded would soon be publishing a cache of emails related to Hillary Clinton.He was right. But an indictment unsealed on Thursday charging Mr. Assange with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer in 2010 makes no mention of the central role that WikiLeaks played in the Russian campaign to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s presidential chances and help elect President Trump. It remains unclear whether the arrest of Mr. Assange will be a key to unlocking any of the lingering mysteries surrounding the Russians, the Trump campaign and the plot to hack an election.The Justice Department spent years examining whether Mr. Assange was working directly with the Russian government, but legal experts point out that what is known about his activities in 2016 — including publishing stolen emails — is not criminal, and therefore it would be difficult to bring charges against him related to the Russian interference campaign.Numerous significant questions are left unanswered, including what, if anything, Mr. Assange knew about the identity of Guccifer 2.0, a mysterious hacker who American intelligence and law enforcement officials have identified as a front for Russian military intelligence operatives.Court documents have revealed that it was Russian intelligence — using the Guccifer persona — that provided Mr. Assange thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.Another question is whether Mr. Assange was a conduit between the Russian hackers and the Trump campaign. Mr. Assange exchanged emails with Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump’s eldest son, during the campaign, and a Trump campaign official sent Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to the president, to get information about the hacked Democratic emails, according to a January indictment by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.Mr. Mueller concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks, the Russians and the Trump campaign, suggesting that prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence that Mr. Assange knowingly engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to help the Trump campaign.But the report drafted by Mr. Mueller’s team, and expected to be released next week, could have additional details about the ties between the Trump campaign and Mr. Assange. Those details could be redacted by the Justice Department, however, if officials believe the material includes classified intelligence, said Carrie Cordero, a former official with the Justice Department’s National Security Division and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.“What was the actual interaction between Russian intelligence surrogates, WikiLeaks and Trump campaign surrogates?” she said. “That is a question that has not yet been answered.”On Thursday, congressional Democrats sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr again demanding that they be provided the full, unredacted report, along with underlying evidence.ImageRobert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks, the Russians and the Trump campaign.CreditCliff Owen/Associated PressThe special counsel also handed off his work to other prosecutors, including those who have long been examining Mr. Assange’s dealings with Guccifer, the Russian intelligence front.Many Democrats and Republicans remain convinced that Mr. Assange knowingly worked with Russian intelligence. On Thursday, Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks “have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years.” The committee’s Democratic vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said Mr. Assange had become “a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West.”Mr. Assange has long been a polarizing figure — hailed at the beginning of his career as champion for government transparency but also viewed by American national security officials as a disruptive force who conspired with Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst, to publish hundreds of thousands of classified documents.But it was WikiLeaks’ publication of material stolen by Russian intelligence in 2016 that hardened the view of national security officials.In April 2017, in one of his first major speeches, Mike Pompeo — who was C.I.A. director at the time but months earlier, as a Republican congressman, had praised WikiLeaks for its releases that damaged the Clinton campaign — signaled that the government would take a hard line on WikiLeaks.Mr. Pompeo compared WikiLeaks to “a hostile intelligence service,” and said it sought support from anti-democratic countries as it targeted the United States with its disclosures.Mr. Pompeo’s public remarks coincided with a private push against Mr. Assange by the Trump administration. The C.I.A. intensified espionage efforts against WikiLeaks, seeking to learn more about his interactions with the Russian intelligence operatives.The timing of Mr. Assange’s actions fueled suspicions. His June 2016 interview announcing the impending release of Democratic emails came three days after a meeting at Trump Tower in New York between Russians and senior Trump campaign officials — a meeting set up on the promise that the Russians would have damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Mr. Assange played down accusations of Russian interference, and misled the public on his source for the damaging documents WikiLeaks released.He offered a $20,000 reward for information about the killing in Washington of Seth Rich, a young Democratic National Committee staff member shot to death in an apparent bungled street robbery. Some supporters of Mr. Trump suggested that it was Mr. Rich who had leaked the committee’s emails and that he had been killed in retaliation.During an August 2016 discussion with Dutch television about the sources of WikiLeaks’ information, Mr. Assange suddenly brought up Mr. Rich’s killing.“That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn’t it?” the interviewer said. “What are you suggesting?”“I’m suggesting that our sources take risks,” Mr. Assange said. He then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Questions Remain About Assange’s Links to Russians and 2016 Election.

They have said that the report is more damaging to President Trump than Barr’s four-page letter suggested.Stephen Colbert made fun of Barr’s brief recap, which said Mueller had concluded that Trump had not conspired with Russia.“Now, Billy Barr said that Mueller cleared the Trump campaign of any coordination with Russia, and Barr himself concluded that the president did not obstruct justice. He did this by taking the almost 400-page Mueller report and summarizing it in just three and a half pages.

Federal prosecutors stepped up enforcement of the often-ignored law in lock step with the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“The crimes that I committed are a source of great shame and regret for me,” Mr. Patten, 47, wrote in a letter to Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington. In court on Friday, he said, “I behaved as if the law did not apply to me and that was wrong.”Judge Jackson said she was most disturbed by Mr. Patten’s misstatements to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about his work in Ukraine and his purchase of the inaugural tickets. She also said his failure to register as a foreign lobbyist for Ukraine was not “a mere technicality” or an oversight, but a serious omission that deprived the American public, members of Congress and policymakers of information necessary to judge the motivations of those who seek to influence them.“People need the facts for democracy to work,” she said.Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors uncovered evidence of Mr. Patten’s offenses while investigating Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was recently sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for financial fraud and conspiracy. Mr. Mueller’s team turned the case over to the United States attorney’s office in Washington, D.C.Although they did not recommend any specific sentence, the prosecutors argued for leniency, saying that Mr. Patten had quickly pleaded guilty and had cooperated with the government in several enforcement matters, including the prosecution of Mr. Manafort. Mr. Patten’s lawyer asked for probation. The charges carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Judge Jackson said she had decided to spare Mr. Patten prison time because he moved quickly to admit his guilt, worked hard to help the special counsel’s investigation and seemed truly remorseful. “You have done everything in your power to make amends,” she said.Both Mr. Manafort’s and Mr. Patten’s offenses were rooted in their work for pro-Russia billionaires in Ukraine, who paid tens of millions of dollars to western lobbyists and law firms to help shape their political party’s message to the West. Mr. Patten essentially picked up where Mr. Manafort left off in 2014, when Viktor F. Yanukovych, a pro-Russian politician whom Mr. Manafort helped elevate to Ukraine’s presidency, was forced from power and fled to Moscow.Like Mr. Manafort, Mr. Patten formed a partnership with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a Russian operative in Ukraine who prosecutors have linked to Russian intelligence. From 2015 to 2017, a political party called the Opposition Bloc paid Mr. Patten’s company more than $1 million, depositing the funds in a bank account in Cyprus.As part of his work, Mr. Patten arranged meetings in Washington between Ukrainian oligarchs and members of Congress and the executive branch, without disclosing his activities to the Justice Department, as required. He also drafted op-ed articles for the oligarchs that were published by American media outlets. The description of one op-ed appeared to match one that bore the name of one oligarch and was published in U.S. News & World Report in February 2017. It argued that Mr. Trump would be good for Ukraine and criticized Ukraine’s current leadership.The judge said the law that required Mr. Patten to disclose such activities is specifically designed “to put people on notice that a foreign government is trying to affect their opinion.” By hiding that information, she said, Mr. Patten worked to undermine the integrity of the public discourse that shapes American opinion and policy.The fact that he also misled Senate committee investigators, she said, “underscores the fact that you knew what you were doing and the word ‘mistake’ does not apply.”Mr. Patten also arranged for a straw donor to purchase four tickets for $50,000 so that a Ukrainian billionaire could attend a Trump inaugural event. It is illegal for foreigners to contribute to presidential inaugural funds, campaigns or political action committees.In a sentencing memorandum, Mr. Patten’s lawyer said his client thought he was merely giving the Ukrainian access to a postelection party, not creating an avenue for influence-peddling. Mr. Patten wrote the judge: “I could have told my client ‘no,’ when he asked me to buy him tickets to the Inauguration party, but I was too eager to please and I broke a rule in doing so.”Federal prosecutors in New York are now investigating whether there were other illegal foreign donations to the inaugural events in addition to the one that Mr. Patten arranged.@SharonLNYT A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Undeclared Lobbyist Is Given Probation.

Mueller has charged 34 people and three companies.Attorney General William Barr issued a summary of Mueller's report on March 24, saying it did not find any evidence that Trump or his associates broke the law in an election that was marked by extensive interference by Russia.Trump denies collusion and obstruction. Russia denies election interference. The following are those who have pleaded guilty or have been indicted in Mueller's inquiry. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RwJarW)PAUL MANAFORTManafort, Trump's former campaign chairman was sentenced to a combined 7-1/2 years in prison in two cases brought by Mueller in which he was convicted by a jury in Virginia in August 2018 and pleaded guilty a month later in Washington.In Virginia, he was found guilty of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.Manafort, who prosecutors said tried to conceal from the U.S. government millions of dollars he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy in a separate case in Washington and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. The Washington case had focused on accusations of money laundering and failing to report foreign bank accounts, among other charges.A judge on Feb. 13 ruled that Manafort had breached his agreement to cooperate with Mueller by lying to prosecutors about three matters pertinent to the Russia probe, including his interactions with a business partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, who they have said has ties to Russian intelligence. MICHAEL COHENCohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, pleaded guilty in August 2018 to crimes including orchestrating "hush money" payments before the 2016 election to women who have said they had sexual encounters with Trump, violating campaign laws. That case was handled by federal prosecutors in New York, not Mueller's office.As part of a separate agreement with Mueller's team, Cohen pleaded guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress about negotiations concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, a project that never materialized.Cohen is due to report to prison on May 6 to begin serving a three-year prison sentence.Cohen in February 2019 testified at a public hearing before a House of Representatives committee. He accused Trump of approving the "hush money" payments and knowing in advance about the 2016 release by the WikiLeaks website of emails that prosecutors have said were stolen by Russia to harm Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. He said Trump implicitly directed him to lie about the Moscow real estate project.He promised to keep cooperating with prosecutors and made multiple closed-door appearances before congressional panels.MICHAEL FLYNNFlynn, Trump's national security adviser for less than a month in early 2017, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia during Trump's presidential transition and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Trump fired him as national security adviser after it emerged that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about his dealings with the then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. His sentencing is pending.ROGER STONEThe longtime Trump ally and presidential campaign adviser was charged in January 2019 with seven criminal counts including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering and making false statements. He pleaded not guilty.His trial date has been set for Nov. 5.Prosecutors said Stone shared with members of the Trump campaign team advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plan to release the stolen Democratic emails. Prosecutors also accused him of trying to interfere with a witness, a radio host who matched the profile of Randy Credico.RICK GATES The former deputy chairman of Trump's campaign, Gates pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy against the United States and lying to investigators. He agreed to cooperate with Mueller and testified as a prosecution witness against Manafort, his former business partner. His sentencing is pending.KONSTANTIN KILIMNIKA Manafort aide in Ukraine and a political operative described by prosecutors as linked to Russian intelligence, Kilimnik was charged in June 2018 with tampering with witnesses about their past lobbying for Ukraine's former pro-Russian government.Prosecutors said in January 2019 that Manafort shared political polling data with Kilimnik in 2016, providing an indication that Trump's campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russians.TWELVE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS Twelve Russian intelligence officers were indicted by a federal grand jury in July 2018, accused of hacking the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations as part of a Russian scheme to release emails damaging to Clinton during the 2016 race. They covertly monitored employee computers and planted malicious code, as well as stealing emails and other documents, according to the indictment.THIRTEEN RUSSIAN NATIONALS, THREE COMPANIESThirteen Russians and three Russian companies were indicted in Mueller's investigation in February 2018, accused of taking part in an elaborate campaign to sow discord in the United States ahead of the 2016 election and harm Clinton's candidacy in order to boost Trump. The companies included: the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg-based propaganda arm known for trolling on social media; Concord Management and Consulting; and Concord Catering. GEORGE PAPADOPOULOSThe former Trump campaign adviser was sentenced in September 2018 to 14 days in prison after pleading guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials, including a professor who told him the Russians had "dirt" on Clinton.ALEX VAN DER ZWAANA lawyer who once worked closely with Manafort and Gates, Van Der Zwaan pleaded guilty in February 2018 to lying to Mueller's investigators about contacts with a Trump campaign official. Van Der Zwaan, the Dutch son-in-law of one of Russia's richest men, was sentenced in April 2018 to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000.RICHARD PINEDOPinedo was not involved with the Trump campaign, but in February 2018 pleaded guilty to identity fraud in a case related to the Mueller investigation for helping Russian conspirators launder money, purchase Facebook ads and pay for supplies.He was sentenced in October 2018 to six months in jail and six months of home detention.SAMUEL PATTENPatten, a veteran political consultant and business partner of Kilimnik, pleaded guilty in August to unregistered lobbying for a pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine and agreed to cooperate with Mueller's probe. Patten also admitted to arranging for a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser for tickets to Trump's inauguration on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, thereby circumventing a law prohibiting foreigners form providing money to the inaugural. The case stemmed from a referral from Mueller to the Justice Department. (Compiled by Susan Heavey, Sarah N.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Rosen Defends Qualifications at Senate Judiciary HearingAdvertisementSupported byRosen Defends Qualifications at Senate Judiciary HearingBy The Associated PressApril 10, 2019WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's nominee for deputy attorney general defended his qualifications for the post at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, as lawmakers raised questions about his lack of criminal law experience.But the tensest moments of Jeffrey Rosen's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee came when he refused to firmly commit to making special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia probe public.The most heated exchange came during questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D- Conn., who asked for Rosen's commitment to support the disclosure of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress without any redactions. Rosen repeatedly said he was not involved in the special counsel's investigation and did not directly answer the question."I will vote against you if you fail to commit that you will respect the institutional authority and obligation of the United States Congress to review that report," Blumenthal shot back.Mueller submitted a nearly 400-page confidential report to Attorney General William Barr last month and Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress of Mueller's "principal conclusions" two days later. Barr's letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates around the time of the 2016 election and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice.Rosen would succeed the current deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and oversaw his work. If confirmed, Rosen would almost certainly be directly involved in the Justice Department's response to inquiries from Congress about the Mueller investigation and cases that were spun off to federal prosecutors.Rosen suggested that he was willing to rebuff political pressure from the White House, if necessary. He told the legislators that he would expect that all criminal investigations "proceed on the facts and the law" and that he believes prosecutions should be "free of improper political influences.""If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no," he said.Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on Rosen's experience and whether he would be in a position to handle the Justice Department's day-to-day operations without any criminal law experience. The deputy attorney general oversees major prosecutions, the department's criminal and national security divisions, and U.S. attorney's offices across the nation.The longtime litigator currently serves as the deputy transportation secretary in the Trump administration and had also worked in private practice and as general counsel in the Office of Management and Budget.The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, cautioned Rosen that a deputy attorney general must be able to "withstand pressure," which she said is even more important "in light of President Trump's repeated calls to investigate his political rivals, including Hillary Clinton."Trump has decried special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which officially concluded last month, as a "witch hunt." He has also said the Justice Department should be investigating Democrats, including Clinton, and chants of "lock her up" have become a rallying cry at Trump's campaign events.During his opening remarks, Rosen pointed to his management experience at the Transportation Department, where he said he acts as the chief operating officer of the agency that has a budget exceeding $80 billion and more than 55,000 employees. He also highlighted his legal experience and told the lawmakers he has argued cases in federal and state courts across the nation. Rosen spent nearly 30 years at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, the same law firm as Barr, in a variety of management roles, including the co-head of the firm's Washington office.Rosen said that if he were confirmed, he would not "be the first person" to become deputy attorney general without having experience in the Justice Department and would surround himself with veteran prosecutors. He also said he has had "many, many dealings" with the Justice Department and its component agencies.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsExplainer: Did He or Didn't He?

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|Explainer: Did He or Didn't He? What Might an Obstruction Case Against Trump Look Like?AdvertisementSupported byExplainer: Did He or Didn't He? What Might an Obstruction Case Against Trump Look Like?By ReutersApril 10, 2019WASHINGTON — A key element of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election was whether President Donald Trump unlawfully acted to impede the investigation, a crime known as obstruction of justice.According to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Mueller's nearly 400-page report on his findings presents evidence on both sides of the question, and while it "does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."But Barr, two days after Mueller submitted the confidential report on March 22, told U.S. lawmakers in a four-page letter that he as attorney general concluded that the evidence amassed by the special counsel "is not sufficient" to establish that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice.Federal law defines obstruction of justice as actions that "corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice."The public may soon get a chance to make its own conclusions. Barr on Tuesday said in congressional testimony he plans to release the report within a week, with portions blacked out to protect certain categories of sensitive information.Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's numerous contacts with Russia and whether he committed obstruction of justice has cast a cloud over his presidency heading into his 2020 re-election bid.Here is an explanation of key events relating to whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. OVAL OFFICE MEETING WITH COMEYThen-FBI Director James Comey and other U.S. intelligence officials attended a Valentine's Day counterterrorism briefing at the White House on Feb. 14, 2017. After the briefing, Trump, who had taken office just weeks before on Jan. 20, asked everyone but Comey to leave the room, according to testimony Comey gave to Congress in June 2017.According to Comey, Trump said he wanted to talk about Michael Flynn, who had resigned under pressure a day earlier amid revelations about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, while Trump's predecessor Barack Obama was still president."I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," Trump told Comey, according to memos Comey wrote about the conversation.Comey testified that he interpreted that as Trump giving him a "direction" regarding an FBI investigation into Flynn's false statements about his Russian contacts: to drop the inquiry. It was one of handful of private conversations between Comey and Trump in early 2017. Trump repeatedly said he expected loyalty, Comey said. Comey said he viewed the conversations as unusual given the FBI's long history of independence from the White House.In March 2017, Trump held a private meeting with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now secretary of state, and asked them to intervene and get the FBI to back off its Flynn investigation. Despite these conversations, the FBI continued to investigate the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia during the 2016 election. TRUMP FIRES COMEYTrump fired Comey on May 9, 2017. The public explanation given by the White House was that Comey had mishandled a 2016 investigation into the use of a private email account and server by Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Justice Department No. 2 official Rod Rosenstein signed letters recommending Comey's firing on those grounds.The next day, Trump had a private White House meeting with visiting Russian officials. "I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job," Trump said, according to reporting by the New York Times. "I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off," Trump added.On May 11, 2017, Trump again appeared to tie Comey's firing to the Russia investigation in an interview with Lester Holt of NBC News. Trump told Holt he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation. "And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,'" the president said.The weekend before firing Comey, Trump dictated to an aide a meandering four-page letter explaining his reasons for firing Comey, which was never sent, according to the New York Times. That letter, which Mueller has obtained, stated Trump's displeasure with Comey's handling of the Russia investigation, the Times reported.TRUMP ORDERS MUELLER'S FIRING Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired Comey. In June 2017, news reports surfaced that Mueller was also investigating possible obstruction by Trump.Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, citing alleged conflicts of interest, but McGahn refused and threatened to quit, the New York Times reported in January 2018. McGahn was concerned that firing Mueller would fuel accusations that the White House was trying to obstruct the investigation, and McGahn's refusal prompted Trump to back off the order, the Times reported.STATEMENT ON TRUMP TOWER MEETINGTrump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., set up a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and other Russians who had offered the campaign damaging information on Clinton. After being promised "dirt" on Clinton, Trump Jr. wrote in an email, "I love it."When news of the meeting broke in July 2017, Trump Jr. issued a misleading statement saying the meeting was set up to discuss adoption policy, not politics, before later admitting he had been expecting intelligence on Clinton. At issue is his father's role in drafting the statement. White House advisers later acknowledged that the president dictated the statement put out in his son's name, after initially denying his involvement. Misleading journalists and the public is not a crime, but the shifting explanations could be seen as evidence of Trump's intent to impede the investigation, legal experts said. PRESIDENTIAL PARDONSTrump lawyer John Dowd in 2017 repeatedly broached the idea of Trump giving presidential pardons to former advisers charged by Mueller, the New York Times reported in March 2018. Some legal experts have said that dangling a pardon in front of witnesses in hopes of influencing their testimony could constitute obstruction of justice. TRUMP ASSAILS SESSIONS OVER RECUSALNormally, the U.S. attorney general would have overseen the Russia inquiry. But Sessions in March 2017 recused himself because of his own contacts with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, while serving as a Trump campaign adviser. Oversight fell to Rosenstein, who subsequently appointed Mueller. The New York Times reported that Trump had pressured Sessions not to recuse himself and erupted in anger when the attorney general did so. Sessions wrote a resignation letter, but Trump rejected it on the advice of advisers, according to news reports. In July 2017, Trump on Twitter called Sessions "beleaguered" and accused him of taking "a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes." In June 2018, Trump tweeted: "The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself." In September 2018, Trump told an interviewer, "I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad." Trump ousted Sessions in November 2018.Trump's hectoring of Sessions could be cited by Mueller as evidence of an intent to obstruct the probe, legal experts said.

The committee vote was 24-17 along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Trump's fellow Republicans opposed.Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, issued a four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election.Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods.In addition to Bannon, the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.They are among 81 people, agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates.Nadler's panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline. Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign.Nadler said he would work with Barr "for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials" and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material."But if that doesn't work out in a very short order, we will issue the subpoenas," Nadler added. "... The committee must see everything." The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government's third branch - the judiciary.Representative Doug Collins, the committee's top Republican, said Democrats are "desperate for dirt on this president.""This is reckless. It's irresponsible. And it's disingenuous," Collins said. "It's also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing: making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy."It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents. It could ignore a subpoena, running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress, and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle.INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Trump critic Adam Schiff, is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump's inaugural committee.Citing people familiar with the request, the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than $100 million. The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters.Barr's March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller's "principal conclusions" said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Moscow denied election interference. Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report."If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge - not the president or his political appointee - to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record," Nadler said. Trump ally Lindsey Graham, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that the House panel's demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was "dangerous and ridiculous."The Justice Department declined comment. Priebus declined to comment. A lawyer for Priebus, Bannon and McGahn, as well as a Bannon spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries. Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge's permission to get access to Mueller's grand jury material, which is protected under federal law. Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far. Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well, noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report's release to Congress.

Kilimnik was indicted in June.Among other offenses, Patten pleaded guilty to communicating with U.S. lawmakers and the media on behalf of the Opposition Bloc, a Russia-aligned political party in Ukraine, without disclosing that work to the Justice Department, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).Patten had been cooperating with the special counsel's probe. His case has also sparked interest in Washington amid a widening crackdown by the Justice Department on undisclosed lobbying.Federal prosecutors in Washington, who started investigating Patten after receiving a referral from Mueller, said in a court filing on Monday that Patten met or spoke with government investigators on the phone nine times.He was also willing to serve as a witness in one of two cases against Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, who had also worked for the Opposition Bloc. Manafort ultimately pleaded guilty, obviating the need for a trial. "Patten has served as a valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations, providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities," prosecutors wrote in the filing.While the prosecutors did not suggest a specific sentence, they said leniency was warranted given Patten's assistance.Mueller wrapped up his investigation two weeks ago without establishing a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. The full Mueller report has not been released to the public yet but is expected in redacted form as early as this week. While acknowledging he broke the law, Patten argued in his own sentencing memo that his case differed from other FARA violations, which have typically involved a lobbyist attempting to conceal the identity of the client and the source of funds. "Mr. Patten did not create companies or entities to hide who he was working for or to conceal foreign influence," Patten's lawyer wrote in the filing arguing for a sentence of probation.Patten also admitted to arranging for a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to pay $50,000 for four tickets to the inauguration of President Donald Trump on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, who reimbursed Patten through a Cypriot account.The move circumvented U.S. law prohibiting foreigners from providing money to an organization running the inauguration.Patten is due to be sentenced on Friday.

Barr told senators at a hearing on Wednesday that he felt the need to further probe how U.S. intelligence agencies conducted themselves in the Russia investigation because "spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""So you're not suggesting, though, that spying occurred?" asked Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate appropriations subcommittee. "I think spying did occur," said Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement officer. "But the question is whether it was adequately predicated, and I am not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated."Barr acknowledged under sharp questioning by lawmakers that there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and later declined to elaborate on why he has concerns.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet that Barr should retract his comments. "Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the Attorney General," Schumer wrote."It sounds as though he thinks that the FBI is conducting some kind of a rogue investigation without the appropriate warrants. I think that's astounding coming from the attorney general," Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary committee, said in an interview with Reuters.Trump on Wednesday launched an especially blistering assault on the actions of FBI officials who began the investigation into the 2016 election before Mueller was appointed in May 2017. "It was started illegally," Trump told reporters at the White House, without citing any evidence. "Everything about it was crooked. Every single thing about it. There were dirty cops," he said. "What they did was treason." Trump allies in Congress backed Barr over his comments. Republican Representative Jim Jordan tweeted: "Pursuing the truth! Holding people accountable! Exactly what Americans want from their Attorney General."BARR HAS MUELLER REPORT Trump on Tuesday praised Barr for his appearance in Congress, saying he was pleased the attorney general was interested in "going back to the origins of exactly where this all started."So hopefully that will happen," Trump said. "There is a hunger for that to happen in this country like I've never seen before."The attorney general is overseeing the release to Congress of the report by Mueller about his 22-month probe into whether members of Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the White House race and if Trump obstructed official inquiries into the matter.Barr on Tuesday said a redacted version of the report would be released within a week. It is expected to shed light on some of the more contentious episodes of Trump's election bid and presidency, including his firing of FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and his campaign's contacts with Russians.

He also said Mueller presented evidence "on both sides" about whether Trump obstructed justice, but he did not draw a conclusion one way or the other.At the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Democratic Senator Brian Schatz pressed Barr on his use of the term "spying," which he called "unnecessarily inflammatory."Barr modified his language, saying, "I want to make sure there was no unauthorised surveillance."He was also asked if he had any evidence of wrongdoing in the course of the federal probe of whether the Trump campaign worked with Moscow to sway the election."I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now, I do have some questions about it," Barr replied.Barr told the committee that he would review all the intelligence activities directed at Trump's 2016 campaign, and added that his review was not specifically directed at the FBI.Barr noted much of this has been done already, both in Congress and by the Justice Department inspector general, but that he will pull it all together to see if there may be "remaining questions to be addressed."Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating whether the FBI and Justice Department followed proper procedures when they applied for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to conduct surveillance on former Trump adviser Carter Page and his ties to Russia. Barr said on Tuesday that investigation was due to wrap up in May or June.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Takeaways From the Case of WikiLeaks Founder Julian AssangeAdvertisementSupported byTakeaways From the Case of WikiLeaks Founder Julian AssangeBy The Associated PressApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — Julian Assange's arrest on Thursday in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London opens the next chapter in the saga of the WikiLeaks founder: an expected extradition fight over a pending criminal prosecution in the United States.It's also likely to trigger a debate over press freedom and call attention to unresolved questions about Assange's role in the release of stolen Democratic emails leading up to the 2016 presidential election, part of special counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Some takeaways from Assange's arrest:THE CHARGES IN THE U.S.Assange, for now at least, faces a single count of computer intrusion conspiracy.He's accused of conspiring in 2010 with Chelsea Manning, then a U.S. Army intelligence analyst who leaked troves of classified material to WikiLeaks, to crack a password that would give her higher-level access to classified computer networks.Prosecutors say Assange and Manning tried to conceal Manning's role as a source by deleting chat logs and removing usernames from sensitive records that were shared. They used a special folder to transmit classified and national defense information, the indictment says. Assange ultimately requested more information related to the password, telling Manning that while he had tried to crack it, he "had no luck so far."PRESS FREEDOM IMPLICATIONSAssange and his supporters say he's a journalist who deserves legal protections for publishing stolen material. But the indictment doesn't really have to do with whether Assange is a journalist.The allegations don't relate to the publication of classified information but focus on his attempts to obtain the material in what prosecutors say was an illegal manner.That distinction could be vital in the government's case and complicates Assange's efforts to cast the prosecution as infringing on press freedom. Justice Department media guidelines are meant to protect journalists from prosecution for doing their jobs, which has historically included the publication of classified information. But the protections don't easily extend to journalists or others who themselves break the law to obtain information or who solicit others to do so, as the government alleges."The act of coaching" someone how to steal information, as alleged in the indictment, "is a step too far," said Ryan Fayhee, a former Justice Department prosecutor who specialized in counterintelligence cases.Assange may well have grounds to argue that, unlike Manning or government officials or contractors, he had no obligation to safeguard American secrets.But his publication of stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign and reliance for them on a foreign adversary like Russia may undermine any defense claim that he's motivated by a public good."His conduct, and his organization's conduct, I believe, undermines any defense that he would pursue having to do with his genuine interest in rooting out corruption and his absolute commitment to transparency," Fayhee said. "Because Russia is anything but the right model to point to in terms of transparency."WHAT HAPPENS NEXTAssange is expected to fight extradition to the U.S., a process that could stretch out for years.He has a top-notch legal team, many devoted supporters and the legal issues in the U.S. case may prove complex.Assuming he is eventually brought to the U.S., Assange would face charges in the Eastern District of Virginia, just outside Washington. The office has considerable experience in national security prosecutions involving accused terrorists and spies and other high-profile matters, like the case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Justice Department officials could easily supplement their indictment with a new one with more serious charges. Manning was jailed last month after she refused to testify before a grand jury in Virginia, suggesting that prosecutors' work related to Assange is not done.Ecuador's president, Lenin Moreno, said he had secured a guarantee from the United Kingdom that Assange wouldn't be extradited to a country where he could face a death penalty. That's likely a reassurance to Assange's supporters, but the charge he currently faces carries just a five-year maximum penalty.The Espionage Act can carry the death penalty for people who deliver national defense information to foreign nations, but that charge was not brought against Assange in the current indictment.Though some of the language in the indictment, including the references to national defense information, mimics the Espionage Act, there's no allegation Assange disclosed American secrets to a foreign power with the goal of harming the U.S.CONNECTION TO MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONOn its face, the charges have nothing to do with Mueller's probe.The indictment was brought not by Mueller and his team but rather by prosecutors in Virginia and the Justice Department's national security division.There is no allegation in the indictment of any involvement in Russian election interference, coordination with Russian hackers or interactions with Trump campaign associates.That's striking since Assange and WikiLeaks have surfaced, albeit obliquely and not by name, in multiple criminal cases brought by Mueller. WikiLeaks was the organization that published Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers. And Roger Stone, a Trump confidant under indictment, repeatedly boasted of connections to WikiLeaks and of having advance knowledge of the organization's publication plans.It is unclear what information, if any, Assange might be willing to offer about how WikiLeaks came to possess the stolen emails.Mueller has farmed out investigations peripheral to his central mission to other Justice Department offices. Though Assange and WikiLeaks cut to the heart of the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, the special counsel ultimately closed his investigation without charging him and before he could even be taken into custody.That could suggest Mueller didn't see a criminal case to be made against Assange or deferred to the Justice Department's existing investigation into him.____Associated Press writer Raphael Satter in London contributed to this report.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsEx-Obama White House Counsel Expects to Be Charged Over Ukraine Work: Statement - The New York Times

FARA is a law requiring a person lobbying or doing public relations for foreign interests to disclose that work to the Justice Department. It has rarely been prosecuted since it was enacted in 1938 with the aim of countering Nazi propaganda.That changed with the May 2017 appointment of Mueller, who employed FARA to prosecute a number of people including U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Skadden report examined efforts by the Ukrainian government to prosecute Yulia Tymoshenko, the country's former head of government, who was convicted in 2011 of embezzlement and corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison.Yanukovych's government used the report to justify to the European Court of Human Rights Tymoshenko's pretrial detention.Craig becomes the second former Skadden lawyer who worked on the report to face charges.Alex van der Zwaan, the Dutch son-in-law of one of Russia's richest men, served 30 days in prison last year for lying to FBI agents about his communications with two former business partners of Manafort. Van der Zwaan's case was brought by Mueller.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|U.S. Political Consultant Avoids Prison Time in Case Linked to Russia ProbeAdvertisementSupported byU.S. Political Consultant Avoids Prison Time in Case Linked to Russia ProbeBy ReutersApril 12, 2019WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Friday sentenced Republican political consultant Samuel Patten to 36 months of probation, 500 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine in a case spun out of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.Patten, 47, pleaded guilty in August to communicating with U.S. lawmakers and news media organizations on behalf of a Russia-aligned political party in Ukraine called the Opposition Bloc without disclosing that work to the Justice Department, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), among other offenses.Patten is a former business partner of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national indicted by Mueller and accused of having ties to Russian intelligence.In Patten's guilty plea he also admitted to arranging for a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to pay $50,000 for four tickets to the inauguration of Republican President Donald Trump on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, who reimbursed Patten through a Cypriot account.Patten, who spoke briefly at the hearing, said he "fully recognized" that he committed serious criminal conduct."I behaved as though the law didn't apply to me and that was wrong," he said.U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Patten's violation of FARA was "not a mere technicality" and undermined the democratic process. "Hiding the truth of who one represents from policymakers undermines our political discourse and diminishes the quality of our policymaking because people need the facts for democracy to work," Berman Jackson said. But the judge said she believed Patten's remorse was genuine and said she credited his substantial cooperation with the special counsel's office."You have told me in no uncertain terms that you accept responsibility for your actions. You didn’t try to justify them, and you didn’t try to blame them on anyone else," Berman Jackson said to Patten, adding "that doesn't happen everyday in this courtroom."Berman Jackson said the acceptance of responsibility was one reason Patten received a much lighter sentence than former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.Berman Jackson last month sentenced Manafort to 73 months in prison for two conspiracy charges arising from the Mueller probe - a sentence called unnecessary and hostile by a Manafort lawyer.Patten's lawyer had asked for a sentence of probation, saying his case was unlike other FARA prosecutions, which have typically involved a lobbyist attempting to conceal the identity of the client and the source of funds.Prosecutors had not suggested a specific sentence but said leniency was warranted given Patten’s cooperation with the special counsel’s probe.Federal prosecutors in Washington, who started investigating Patten after receiving a referral from Mueller, said in a court filing on Monday that Patten met or spoke with government investigators on the phone nine times.He was also willing to serve as a witness in one of two cases against Manafort, who had also worked for the Opposition Bloc. Manafort ultimately pleaded guilty, obviating the need for a trial.Patten's case has sparked interest in Washington amid a widening crackdown by the Justice Department on undisclosed lobbying.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexBusinessSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperBusiness|Germans in Swiss 'Cum-Ex' Trial Given Suspended SentencesAdvertisementSupported byGermans in Swiss 'Cum-Ex' Trial Given Suspended SentencesBy ReutersApril 11, 2019ZURICH — Three Germans on trial in Switzerland for helping expose a tax-stripping scheme that cost European governments billions of euros will likely avoid prison after a verdict on Thursday that fell well short of prosecutors' demands.The men, Stuttgart-based lawyer Eckart Seith and two former employees of Basel-based Bank J. Safra Sarasin, had faced up to 3-1/2 years in prison for numerous charges. Instead, they got suspended fines and jail terms for violating banking secrecy."The Zurich District Court condemns three persons, accused of transferring a bank customer list to a German lawyer, for multiple violations of the banking law," the court said in a statement, adding one banker was also found guilty of industrial espionage and coercion. The defendants were acquitted of all other charges, the court said.Seith could not be reached immediately for comment. He told German newspaper FAZ he would lodge an appeal.The case, in which prosecutors said the accused passed secret Swiss bank documents to German authorities, is linked to the border-crossing fraud investigation into so-called "cum-ex trades" in which financial powerhouses including BlackRock, Spain's Santander and Deutsche Bank are under scrutiny. In the 2001-2011 scheme, European governments were duped into believing a stock had multiple owners, each entitled to a dividend and a tax credit. Germany, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and other countries lost tax revenue that instead benefited wealthy investors.The Zurich trial was linked to German drug chain billionaire Erich Mueller, a Bank Sarasin client who lost around 50 million euros (43.1 million pounds) in 2012 on cum-ex trades after German tax officials balked at paying him a tax credit. Mueller, seeking to recoup his money from Sarasin, hired Seith and worked with the two German bankers, both of whom spent time in investigative custody in Switzerland.In 2017, a German court ruled Bank Sarasin had to pay 45 million euros to Mueller. Sarasin's ex-deputy chief executive, Eric Sarasin, in 2016 also paid a settlement in Germany.Switzerland, the world's largest offshore wealth centre, last year began sharing bank data with many foreign tax authorities, bowing to international pressure to help crack down on tax cheats.Still, the Zurich case shows the nation continues to move aggressively against people who pass on bank information to foreign individuals or governments.Meanwhile, German media have celebrated Seith for helping expose the cum-ex scheme.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|AP FACT CHECK: Trump Knew WikiLeaks Until He Didn'tAdvertisementSupported byAP FACT CHECK: Trump Knew WikiLeaks Until He Didn'tBy The Associated PressApril 13, 2019WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump knew WikiLeaks until he didn't.With his government seeking to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Trump is drawing a blank on a hacking organization he praised to the rafters during the 2016 campaign because of the discomfort it caused his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.It was among a number of factual faux pas and flips in his rhetoric over the past week.A few months after asserting a need for legal immigrants, Trump declared the country "full" and he also seemed to change the grounds upon which he is refusing to release his taxes: It's not because he can't, but because he doesn't want to.And with the release of more of the special counsel's report imminent, Trump kept up his refrain that Robert Mueller exonerated him despite Mueller's explicit statement that he did not.A review:WIKILEAKSTRUMP, asked if he still "loves" WikiLeaks: "I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing." — remarks Thursday with South Korea's president.THE FACTS: WikiLeaks was very much Trump's thing in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when candidate Trump showered praise on the anti-secrecy organization night after night.On the same October day that the "Access Hollywood" tape emerged, revealing that Trump had bragged in 2005 about groping women, WikiLeaks began releasing damaging emails from Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. Trump and his allies seized on the dumps and weaponized them."WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks," Trump said in Pennsylvania."This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove," Trump said in Michigan."Boy, I love reading WikiLeaks," Trump said in Ohio.All told, Trump extolled WikiLeaks more than 100 times, and a poster of Assange hung backstage at the Republican's debate war room. At no point from a rally stage did Trump express any misgivings about how WikiLeaks obtained the emails from the Clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive U.S. government information, which led to the charges against Assange on Thursday. The U.S. is seeking Assange's extradition from Britain.___TAX RETURNSTRUMP: "As you know, I got elected last time with this same issue. ... I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit." — remarks Wednesday to reporters at the White House.THE FACTS: Nothing's preventing Trump from releasing his tax returns.Being under audit is no legal bar to anyone releasing his or her returns.Asked repeatedly at a House hearing Tuesday whether any regulation prohibited a taxpayer from disclosing returns when under audit, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig responded "no."Trump declined to provide his tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president, something party nominees have traditionally done in the name of the transparency. By withholding his tax returns, Trump has not followed the standard followed by presidents since Richard Nixon started the practice in 1969. During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to release his returns but because he was under a routine audit, "I can't."After the November midterm elections, Trump claimed at a news conference that the filings are too complex for people to understand.___JOB APPROVALTRUMP, tweeting a Fox Business Network graphic showing his "soaring approval" at 55% overall: "Great news! #MAGA" — tweet Thursday.THE FACTS: The graphic on the Georgetown University poll was incorrect: The poll found 55% disapproval of Trump's performance, not approval. Fox Business issued an on-air correction but Trump's tweet remains.___CLIMATE CHANGETRUMP: "We withdrew the United States from the one-sided Paris climate accord, where you don't do any more drilling for oil and gas. That was going to cost us a lot of money. No more oil and gas with the Paris accord. That's good for Paris, but that's not good for us. Right?" — remarks Wednesday at a ceremony for the signing of executive orders meant to accelerate pipeline construction.THE FACTS: Wrong. The Paris accord does not ban any form of energy development. It does not impose emission caps on signatory countries. The accord is a set of voluntary targets determined by individual nations.___RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP: "I've been totally exonerated. No collusion. No obstruction." — remarks Wednesday at the White House.TRUMP: "I'm not concerned about anything, because frankly there was no collusion and there was no obstruction." — remarks Thursday with South Korea's president.THE FACTS: Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's nearly 400-page report did not "totally" exonerate Trump. Mueller specifically states in the report, as quoted by Barr: "While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not "draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction," but rather set out evidence for both sides, leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was "not sufficient" to establish, for the purposes of prosecution, that Trump committed obstruction.In Senate testimony Wednesday, Barr acknowledged that Mueller did not ask him to draw a conclusion on the obstruction question, nor did he know whether Mueller agreed with him. Barr said he would be able to explain more fully after releasing a public version of Mueller's report in coming days.___IMMIGRATIONTRUMP: "Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!" — tweet Sunday.THE FACTS: Despite the overwhelmed southern border, there's plenty of room in the United States. Dozens of countries have greater population density. It's only full in terms of the people Trump doesn't want.His claim of a U.S. with no vacancies for more immigrants is at odds with his own statement two months ago that encouraged "the largest" influx of legal immigrants ever. It also belies a U.S. reality of aging baby boomers and falling birth rates, which make immigrants increasingly important to sustain a level of population growth for the U.S. economy to keep expanding.The nation's population growth is at its lowest since 1937, with the 18-and-under population declining both nationally and in 29 states, according to William H. Frey of the Brookings Institution. Economists say that restricting immigration would probably weaken economic growth. A shrinking labor force could also harm the health and stability of safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare.Trump himself seemed to acknowledge the realities during his State of the Union address in February, declaring, "I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally." He's now describing a U.S. bursting at the seams, unable to take any immigrants, including those seeking legal asylum.Immigrants as a whole make up a greater percentage of the total U.S. population than they did back in 1970, having grown from less than 5 percent of the population to more than 13 percent now. In 2030, it's projected that immigrants will become the primary driver for U.S. population growth, overtaking U.S. births.___TRUMP on separating migrant children from their parents when caught crossing into the U.S. illegally: "I'm the one that stopped it. President Obama had child separation." — remarks to reporters Tuesday.THE FACTS: No, he's the one who started it on a broad scale. He instituted a "zero tolerance" policy aimed at criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing into the U.S. illegally. That meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody. During the Obama administration and the early Trump administration, such family separations were the exception. They became the rule under his policy. He suspended the practice in June because of a public uproar.___TRUMP on the family separations: "President Obama had the law. We changed the law, and I think the press should accurately report it but of course they won't." — remarks to reporters Tuesday.THE FACTS: This is false. Trump did not achieve any change in the law.Trump's zero-tolerance policy was of his own making. His administration is operating under the same immigration laws as Obama's.During the Obama administration and before Trump's zero-tolerance policy was introduced, migrant families caught illegally entering the U.S. were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation, unless they were known to have a criminal record. Then and now, immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases, such as serious criminal charges against a parent, concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns.___ENERGY and ENVIRONMENTTRUMP: "We have the cleanest air and water, they say, in the world. We are the best."— remarks Wednesday at the signing of orders on pipelines.THE FACTS: Not true about air.U.S. drinking water is among the best by one leading measure.Trump's own Environmental Protection Agency data show that in 2017, among 35 major U.S. cities, there were 729 cases of "unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution." That's up 22 percent from 2014 and the worst year since 2012. Findings for 2018 are incomplete.The State of Global Air 2019 report by the Health Effects Institute rated the U.S. as having the eighth cleanest air for particle pollution — which kills 85,000 Americans each year — behind Canada, Scandinavian countries and others.The U.S. ranks poorly on smog pollution, which kills 24,000 Americans per year. On a scale from the cleanest to the dirtiest, the U.S. is at 123 out of 195 countries measured.On water, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water, the U.S. among them. On environmental quality overall, the U.S. was 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.___TRUMP: "With the help of the incredible workers in this room, the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, anywhere on the planet. Not even close. Made a lot of progress in the last two and a half years, haven't we? Huh? Took down a lot of barriers." — signing ceremony.THE FACTS: As he's done many times before, Trump is crediting himself with things that happened under Obama.Here's what the government's U.S. Energy Information Administration says: "The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when U.S. natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when U.S. production exceeded Saudi Arabia's."As for crude oil specifically, the information agency says the U.S. became the world's top crude oil producer last year. That is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began during the Obama administration, which has sent production from the Permian Basin in the southwest surging.___TRUMP: "Under this administration, we have ended the war on American energy like never before." — signing ceremony.THE FACTS: It wasn't much of a war. U.S. petroleum and natural gas production has increased by nearly 60% since 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration, achieving pre-eminence during the Obama administration. That said, the Trump administration is more closely aligned with fossil fuel interests as it works to restrain environmental obstacles and the power of states to stand in the way of pipelines and other energy development.___Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Ellen Knickmeyer, Seth Borenstein and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington and Nomaan Merchant in Houston contributed to this report.___Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bdAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsEx-Obama WH Counsel Charged With Lying in Lobbying Probe - The New York Times

Barr testified on Wednesday before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.CreditCreditMelissa Lyttle for The New York TimesBy Nicholas Fandos and Adam GoldmanApril 10, 2019WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F.B.I.’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, including whether “spying” conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign’s associates had been properly carried out.“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Mr. Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, adding that he wanted to look into both “the genesis and the conduct” of the F.B.I. inquiry. He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government.“I think spying did occur,” Mr. Barr said. “The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”The remarks by the new attorney general — particularly his embrace of the term spying, which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation — are certain to please President Trump and his allies, who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice.Mr. Barr’s pledge, made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel’s report on the Russia inquiry, was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president’s campaign and Russia, the Justice Department’s focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr. Trump has demanded.In addition to Mr. Barr’s review of the F.B.I. investigation, the Justice Department’s inspector general, a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry. Those actions include how officials opened the Trump-Russia investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Trump’s thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks. Minutes before Mr. Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday, the president called the investigation an “attempted coup” and claimed, again, that he had been “totally exonerated” by the report, despite the fact that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation in 2017, explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice.“It was an illegal investigation,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas. In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date, Mr. Trump said: “Everything about it was crooked — every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.”“This was an attempted takedown of a president,” he added. “And we beat them. We beat them.”Mr. Mueller delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr. Barr late last month. Much of Wednesday’s hearing, and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday, was focused on that report, on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public, and on Mr. Barr’s characterization of what Mr. Mueller found.Mr. Barr, who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report public next week, used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr. Trump did. The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work, including the inspector general who could deliver a report in May or June, before replicating their review.ImageRobert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation in 2017, delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr. Barr late last month.CreditCliff Owen/Associated PressHe said he was not starting an investigation into the F.B.I. or any other law enforcement agency, per se, but he did allude to several of the bureau’s former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry.“To the extent there were any issues at the F.B.I., I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F.B.I.,” Mr. Barr said. “I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.”Mr. Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement, and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him.The F.B.I. obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide, Carter Page, after he left the campaign. Republicans in Congress have questioned the legality of that warrant because it used unverified Democrat-funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer. But a judge approved it, and it was not clear whether any laws were broken.Both Dana Boente, now the F.B.I. general counsel, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, signed the FISA renewal application on Mr. Page.The bureau sought the wiretap on Mr. Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier. Among claims that Mr. Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016, Mr. Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton — an accusation that Mr. Page has denied.The F.B.I. also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates, which prompted more accusations of spying by the president.Mr. Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out, including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan.Defenders of the F.B.I. have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign. The F.B.I. and Justice Department, they say, waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr. Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia.Still, the wiretap order enabled F.B.I. agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr. Page’s account, including when he was working with the campaign. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so-called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file. However, there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.The inspector general has also asked about the handling of F.B.I. informants, including Mr. Steele and Stefan A. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain.ImagePresident Trump spoke Wednesday before leaving for Texas. He called the Russia investigation “illegal” and said that “everything about it was crooked.”CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesAfter the F.B.I. opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016, agents asked Mr. Halper to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another former Trump campaign adviser.Mr. Halper had also spoken to Mr. Page at a symposium that month, which has raised suspicions by critics of the F.B.I. that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said. But that earlier encounter was a coincidence, according to a former federal law enforcement official.Mr. Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes, many of which have been the subject of news reports.“I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused,” he said. “I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general.”Democrats involved in Congress’s investigations of Russia’s election interference quickly chastised Mr. Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right-wing conspiracy of F.B.I. wrongdoing.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was “going off the rails” to protect Mr. Trump.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Mr. Barr of giving “a wink and a nod” to a “long-debunked ‘spying’ conspiracy.”And at one point, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, pressed Mr. Barr on whether he had “specific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation.” Mr. Barr said he did not.“I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,” he said. “I do have questions about it.”But when Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Mr. Barr if he had intended to use the term spying — a term the senator said might “cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out” — Mr. Barr rephrased his statement.“I’m not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you’re referring to,” the attorney general said, then he added, “I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.”Mr. Barr, who began his career at the C.I.A., did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong, according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation. Mr. Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance. He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump’s associates in 2016.Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, elicited a response from Mr. Barr that invoked another era. When she asked why Mr. Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation, he answered that “the generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government.”Katie Benner and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

All of them are escapees from the Islamic State’s last stretch of territory, which fell to American-backed forces last month.The woman in the photo is Louisa Akavi, 62, a New Zealand nurse and midwife who was abducted in late 2013 in the northwest Syrian city of Idlib. She is one of the last links to the group of at least 23 Western hostages held by ISIS, a majority of whom were released for ransom while others were killed in widely publicized beheadings.For more than five years, her employer and her government imposed an especially strict media blackout, warning that any mention not only of her identity, but even of her nationality, could endanger her. But now that ISIS’ caliphate has collapsed, the aid group has broken its silence in hopes that the public can help find her and two Red Cross drivers, both Syrians, kidnapped alongside her.“From the moment Louisa and the others were kidnapped, every decision we made was to maximize the chances of winning their freedom,” said Yves Daccord, director general of the humanitarian organization, in his first interview about his missing colleagues. “With the Islamic State group having lost the last of its territory, we felt it was now time to speak out.”The aid group and the New Zealand government have reason to believe she is alive. As recently as December, Red Cross officials said, at least two people described seeing her at a clinic in Sousa, one of the final villages to be held by ISIS.

By The New York TimesThe Red Cross also considers credible at least three other reported sightings of her — in Abu Kamal in 2016, Raqqa in 2017 and Mayadeen last year, officials with the aid group said.Some of the witnesses said they saw her performing medical duties at clinics and hospitals under ISIS control, indicating that she was no longer held in a cell and was able to use her nursing skills to win a modicum of freedom, according to Mr. Daccord.Current and former American intelligence officials, as well as government officials in New Zealand, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there were strong indications that she was alive last year, based on sightings. The American officials also said that Ms. Akavi might have been held with a British hostage, the journalist John Cantlie, at Mosul University in neighboring Iraq, before the area was liberated in late 2016.Based on the intelligence indicating that Ms. Akavi was still alive, New Zealand deployed special forces to Syria to search for her, the foreign minister, Winston Peters, said in a statement on Monday. The “non-combat” team, which has included members from the New Zealand Defense Force and the Foreign Ministry staff, is authorized to visit Syria “from time to time,” Mr. Peters said. “The efforts to locate and recover Louisa are ongoing.”Ms. Akavi would be the longest-held hostage in the 156-year history of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the group said. Her ordeal began in late October 2013, when she traveled to Idlib to deliver medical supplies. Three days later, she and six colleagues were returning to Damascus in a convoy marked with the Red Cross emblem when gunmen stopped them at a checkpoint. Four of the aid workers were freed the next day, but Ms. Akavi and two others, Nabil Bakdounes and Alaa Rajab, remain missing.ImageAn ISIS jail in Raqqa. Ms. Akavi was held in the city in 2014, along with other international prisoners, the Red Cross learned.CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesMr. Daccord was immediately alerted to their disappearance, and a 15-member Red Cross team, including a crisis group in Geneva, began looking for them. “I was convinced she’d be back soon — 24 hours, 48 hours, a week,” said Avril Patterson, a colleague of Ms. Akavi’s who arrived in Damascus a day after her friend’s disappearance. “And then as time goes on, your denial doesn’t work anymore.”At first, the Red Cross did not know the identity of the captors. But then, a school near the checkpoint where the workers were taken was painted with the ISIS logo.Months later, in phone calls, emails and text messages, the terrorist group negotiated with the Red Cross, initially demanding a ransom of less than 1 million euros — under $1.1 million — and calling for the release of detained ISIS fighters. But the ransom fluctuated as time went on, the aid group said, rising to €20 million before dropping down to €5 million, the amount requested for several other Western hostages.In those exchanges, the Red Cross was able to send proof-of-life questions, asking for the number of Ms. Akavi’s insurance policy, which her family said was written on a card the nurse kept with her. ISIS provided the correct number, one of several personal questions the group answered that convinced the Red Cross it was in fact speaking to her captors, Mr. Daccord said.By early 2014, the aid group confirmed that Ms. Akavi was being detained in a facility next to an oil installation outside Raqqa. She shared a cell with an American aid worker, Kayla Mueller, according to the aid group and others who were in the same jail. An adjacent cell held more than a dozen male prisoners from Europe and North America, including the American journalist James Foley, as well as Mr. Cantlie, the only other Western hostage who may still be alive, according to a statement in February by a British government official.By mid-2014, ISIS had released most of the hostages after their governments, and sometimes their employers or families, paid multimillion-dollar ransoms. But three British and four American citizens, whose governments hew to a strict no-ransom policy, remained behind, along with Ms. Akavi.That August, after failing to get a ransom for his release, ISIS killed Mr. Foley. His beheading, and the similarly brutal deaths of two British hostages and the remaining American men in the next few months, shocked the public and rattled the Obama administration. That set in motion a military intervention in Syria that ended just weeks ago with the collapse of ISIS’ rule.The female prisoners were initially spared, even though ISIS sent the Red Cross an email in July 2014 saying it planned to execute both Ms. Akavi and Ms. Mueller as retaliation for a failed rescue attempt by American commandos, according to Mr. Daccord.By autumn, the women were sharing their cell with two Yazidi teenagers who had been abducted with thousands of other women in Iraq to be used as sex slaves.“They took us to Raqqa and put us in a jail — that’s where we met Kayla and Louisa,” recalled one of the teenagers, D., who asked to be identified only by her first initial. “Louisa was old. She said her hand was hurting,” said D., now 19, who was interviewed in 2015 at a refugee camp in Iraq after escaping.She described how for most of the day, Ms. Akavi lay on the floor of their cell, apparently too ill to sit up. The Red Cross was warned in communications with ISIS that Ms. Akavi was sick, Mr. Daccord said, but never learned what was wrong. A proof-of-life video in the summer of 2014 showed her looking tired, but with no visible signs of injury or illness.Sometime that fall, guards moved Ms. Mueller and the Yazidi girls to a villa where they became sex slaves to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the caliph of the terrorist group, according to the teenagers and the former United States officials. Ms. Akavi was left behind, apparently because of her age and frail health, the two girls said. ISIS announced that Ms. Mueller, 26, died in early 2015, claiming she was killed in an airstrike by the American-led coalition.ImageJohn Cantlie, a British journalist taken hostage by ISIS in 2012, is also believed to be alive.CreditAssociated PressBorn on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, Ms. Akavi was raised in New Zealand. She completed her nursing training at Wellington Hospital in 1977 and went on to work in hospitals in New Zealand, England and Scotland.She deployed on her first Red Cross mission in 1988, treating Vietnamese boat people in Malaysia, she recalled in an oral history recorded for a university thesis.Ms. Akavi later served in war zones including Somalia, Chechnya, Iraq and Afghanistan. “I know I can make a difference — a small difference,” she told the Kapiti Observer newspaper in 2010.She had her share of close calls. In 1996, Ms. Akavi survived an attack by gunmen on a Red Cross medical center near Grozny, in Chechnya, by hiding in a locked room. Six colleagues perished in the assault, the most deadly in the organization’s history.Three years later, she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve.In late 2014, ISIS stopped responding to the Red Cross’s messages, and there was no news of Ms. Akavi in 2015, officials with the aid group said. But in 2016, they received a tentative confirmation that a foreign woman matching her description had been spotted in Abu Kamal, a town in Syria where the group’s fighters had retrenched.Then, in what Mr. Daccord called “a breakthrough,” several people who had escaped to detention camps in Iraq in late 2017 told Red Cross workers they had been treated by Ms. Akavi in Syria.“This was incredible information to receive, apparent confirmation of her location, that she was still alive and that she was still doing what she is trained to do and has long done: providing medical care in a conflict zone,” Mr. Daccord said.Among the strongest evidence that she was still alive came just four months ago, when two people interviewed by the Red Cross confirmed seeing her working as a nurse in Sousa.But since then, there has been no reported sighting. Tens of thousands of ISIS supporters — including fighters and their wives and children — poured into the desert in the final weeks before the group’s last toehold was liberated. The women are being held behind a chain-link fence at the al-Hol detention camp. The sprawling tent city has been described as a “mini-caliphate” with ISIS wives patrolling the area, threatening women who do not cover their faces.On weekly trips, Red Cross workers are checking the camp for Ms. Akavi. They worry she may be inside and fearful of identifying herself because of possible repercussions from ISIS loyalists there.And so, a few weeks ago, a senior Red Cross official traveled to the camp with one mission: erect a tall Red Cross flag amid the tents. It is intended to be a beacon of sorts for Ms. Akavi, encouraging her to approach her colleagues and seek refuge, if she is there.“There is a chance that it will reach her,” Mr. Daccord said.Charlotte Graham-McLay contributed reporting.

SchmidtApril 11, 2019SAUSALITO, Calif. — The former F.B.I. director James B. Comey said on Thursday that he knew of no electronic surveillance aimed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, defending the bureau after Attorney General William P. Barr asserted a day earlier that the bureau spied on the campaign as part of the Russia investigation.“When I hear that kind of language used, it’s concerning because the F.B.I., the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance,” said Mr. Comey, who oversaw the inquiry until President Trump abruptly fired him in May 2017. “I have never thought of that as spying.”Mr. Barr said in congressional testimony on Wednesday that the bureau might have taken improper measures while investigating links between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, describing the F.B.I.’s conduct as “spying,” a term typically associated with unlawful surveillance.“I think spying did occur,” Mr. Barr said. “The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”Mr. Barr’s statement lined up with that longstanding talking point used by Mr. Trump and his allies. A person who has discussed the matter with Mr. Barr said that he did not mean to imply that the measures had been improper, but Mr. Barr never released a statement clarifying his remarks.Mr. Trump said again on Thursday that he believed “there was absolutely spying into my campaign.”“I’ll go a step further: In my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying, and something that should never be allowed to happen in our country again,” Mr. Trump said. “And I think his answer was actually a very accurate one.”Democrats on Capitol Hill accused Mr. Barr of imparting the authority of his office onto right-wing conspiracy theories favored by the president and his allies that American authorities illegally monitored the Trump campaign. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, echoing members of his party, said the attorney general had lost all credibility.ImageAttorney General William P. Barr said in congressional testimony on Wednesday that the bureau spied on the Trump campaign as part of the Russia investigation.CreditMelissa Lyttle for The New York Times“Barr’s comments yesterday have just destroyed the scintilla of credibility he had left in terms of being a fair and impartial person,” Mr. Schumer told reporters, while accusing Mr. Barr of behaving like “the press secretary to the president.”In 2016, the F.B.I. sent an informant, a typical investigative step, to speak to two Trump campaign advisers after agents uncovered evidence that both had suspicious contacts linked to Russia during the campaign. When the role of the informant gained attention last year, the president seized on it to accuse law enforcement officials of illegally infiltrating his campaign.Mr. Comey is familiar with the issue. In March 2017, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. and Obama administration in a tweet of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign. The tweet angered Mr. Comey, who knew the claim was false and pushed the Justice Department to refute it. The Justice Department never released a statement, but Mr. Comey later said publicly that Mr. Trump’s claim had no merit.“If the attorney general has come to the belief that that should be called spying, wow,” Mr. Comey said at a cybersecurity conference outside San Francisco. “That’s going to require a whole lot of conversations inside the Department of Justice. But I don’t know what he meant.”Mr. Comey said that regardless of what the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found during his investigation into Mr. Trump and his campaign, Mr. Barr already revealed, in his letter to Congress last month, that the investigation had uncovered important facts about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.“It tells us even without even reading the Mueller report that the Russia thing was not a hoax,” Mr. Comey said. “That it was real and that it is backed — that assessment is backed by hard evidence. It is true that the Russians came after us. They are going to come again because they exceeded their wildest hopes.”Despite Mr. Barr’s claims about spying, Mr. Comey said he would give Mr. Barr the benefit of the doubt that he would put following the facts and law above protecting the president.“Maybe the only thing I can say generally is I think his career has earned him a presumption that he will be one of the rare Trump cabinet members who will stand up for things like truth and facts and institutional values.

His arrest paved the way for his possible extradition to the United States.Assange's indictment arose from a criminal investigation dating back to former President Barack Obama's administration. It was triggered in part by WikiLeaks' 2010 publication of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications, a disclosure that embarrassed Washington and caused strained relations with allies.The Justice Department said Assange, 47, was arrested under an extradition treaty between the United States and Britain and was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.The indictment, filed in March 2018 and unsealed on Thursday, said Assange in March 2010 engaged in a conspiracy to help Manning crack a password stored on Defense Department computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications.Manning had access to the computers as an intelligence analyst and was using them to download classified records to transmit to WikiLeaks, the Justice Department said. Cracking the password would have enabled Manning to log on under a username other than her own, making it harder for investigators to determine the source of the illegal disclosures, it said.Manning, formerly named Bradley Manning, was jailed on March 8 after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury in what is widely believed to be related to the Assange investigation.Manning was convicted by court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offenses for furnishing more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks while she was an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Obama commuted the final 28 years of Manning's 35-year sentence. "Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges," Barry Pollack, a lawyer for Assange, said in a statement, saying the allegations "boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source."A law enforcement official close to the case refused to discuss whether additional charges could be filed against Assange. Mark MacDougall, a former federal prosecutor, said on Thursday he believes the government's case against Assange looks like a "placeholder indictment.""They had to thoroughly investigate the Manning case," he said. "I think what you are seeing in this short indictment is a small sample of the fruit of that investigation." Representatives for Manning had no immediate comment.The indictment said Manning downloaded four massive U.S. government databases containing some 90,000 Afghanistan war reports, 400,000 Iraq war reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs and 250,000 State Department cables. U.S. officials said the leaks endangered the lives of American troops.SPECIAL COUNSEL INQUIRYSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller scrutinized the actions of WikiLeaks in his 22-month investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election. The website published emails damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies have said were stolen by Russia in a bid to boost Republican Donald Trump's candidacy.The Obama administration decided not to prosecute WikiLeaks and Assange on the grounds that the website's work was too similar to journalistic activities protected by the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of the press.The indictment quoted from a conversation in which Assange encouraged Manning to provide more information: Manning told Assange that "after this upload, that's all I really have got left," with Assange replying that "curious eyes never run dry in my experience."WikiLeaks has faced criticism from U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who when he was CIA director in 2017 called Assange a "fraud" and WikiLeaks a "hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."But Trump praised the website during the presidential campaign. At a rally shortly before the election, Trump said "I love WikiLeaks" after it released the hacked Democratic emails that harmed Clinton's candidacy.Assange, who took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden in a sexual assault investigation, has said he did not know the source of Democratic Party-related emails WikiLeaks published before the election, but said he did not get them from Russia.

I also do not want to burden FIFA on its path to more transparency and good governance."Grindel, who took over the world's biggest sports federation by membership in 2016, had come under pressure over income he received from a DFB subsidiary and a watch he had been given by Ukrainian businessman and soccer administrator Grigory Surkis.While denying any wrongdoing, Grindel said last week he had been unaware that the watch was worth 6,000 euros (5,168.9 pounds).On Wednesday he again said he had done nothing wrong and that there had been no conflict of interest.During his time as DFB chief, Grindel was criticised for his handling of the case of German national player Mesut Ozil, who had his photograph taken alongside Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan prior to last year's World Cup.Ozil retired from the national team after Germany's shock first round exit and said he had faced "racism and disrespect" because of his Turkish roots.Grindel criticised Germany coach Joachim Loew last month after he dropped Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller from the national team, before rowing back on his comments.

Craig was released on relatively unrestrictive terms and ordered not to travel outside the Washington metro area.CreditCreditJeenah Moon/ReutersBy Zach MontagueApril 12, 2019WASHINGTON — Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, was arraigned on Friday and pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to the Justice Department and withheld information about work he did for the government of Ukraine.Mr. Craig appeared in federal court in Washington a day after he was indicted on the charges, which grew out of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Craig was arraigned before Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson, who released him on relatively unrestrictive terms, ordering that he continue to reside at his current address and not travel outside the Washington metro area.William Murphy, a lawyer for Mr. Craig, asked to revisit the terms of Mr. Craig’s release on Monday, when Mr. Craig will appear before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court in Washington for another hearing. Mr. Murphy also said he planned to ask that Mr. Craig be allowed to keep his passport.The indictment alleged that, while a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Mr. Craig took on work on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine. The work was brought to Mr. Craig by Paul Manafort, then a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych and later the campaign chairman for President Trump in 2016. The charges stated that Mr. Craig lied in order to avoid registering with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and withheld information about the full scope of his activities.At the heart of the case is whether Mr. Craig’s interaction with a reporter for The New York Times triggered the requirement for him to register under the foreign lobbying law.Mr. Craig is a prominent Democrat and a veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump complained on Twitter that the indictment had not received sufficient attention from the news media, despite the “very serious charges” it described.Mr. Craig maintained his innocence in a video shared on YouTube on Thursday. He and his lawyers left quietly after the hearing without giving comment.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Former Obama Aide Pleads Not Guilty to Charges of Lying.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|'I Know Nothing'-Trump Changes His Tune on WikiLeaksAdvertisementSupported by'I Know Nothing'-Trump Changes His Tune on WikiLeaksBy The Associated PressApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — It was a far cry from "I love WikiLeaks!"President Donald Trump declared that "I know nothing about WikiLeaks" after its disheveled founder Julian Assange was hauled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to face charges, a stark contrast to how candidate Trump showered praise on Assange's hacking organization night after night during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.Asked about Thursday's arrest, Trump said at the White House, "It's not my thing. I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I've been seeing what's happened with Assange and that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who's doing an excellent job. So, he'll be making a determination . I know nothing really about him.""It's not my deal in life."But WikiLeaks was Trump's deal in 2016 as he welcomed the political boost his campaign got and cheered on the release of Clinton campaign emails.On the same October day that the "Access Hollywood" tape emerged, revealing that Trump had bragged in 2005 about groping women, WikiLeaks began releasing damaging emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. Trump and his allies, facing a tough battle in the campaign's final month, seized on the illegal dumps and weaponized them."WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks," Trump said in Pennsylvania."This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove," Trump said in Michigan."Boy, I love reading WikiLeaks," Trump said in Ohio.All told, Trump extolled WikiLeaks more than 100 times, and a poster of Assange hung backstage at the Republican's debate war room. At no point from a rally stage did Trump express any misgivings about how WikiLeaks obtained the emails from the Clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive U.S. government information, which led to the charges against Assange on Thursday.Assange for years has been under U.S. Justice Department scrutiny for WikiLeaks' role in publishing thousands of government secrets. He was an important figure in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, as investigators examined how WikiLeaks obtained emails that were stolen from Democratic groups.When asked about Assange in 2017, Trump said he did not "support or unsupport" WikiLeaks' move to release hacked emails and that he would not be involved in any decision for the U.S. government to arrest Assange."I am not involved in that decision," whether or not to arrest Assange, Trump told The Associated Press then, "but if they want to do it, it's OK with me."The Justice Department now has charged Assange with taking part in a computer hacking conspiracy, accusing him of scheming with Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, to break a password for a classified government computer.The single charge of computer intrusion conspiracy carries up to five years in prison, though the Justice Department can add additional charges depending on the evidence it gathers. Manning was ordered jailed last month for refusing to testify before a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, suggesting that prosecutors are still at work.It was unclear why the Assange charge, which was brought under seal last year, was made public at this time and why he was taken into custody now — weeks after Mueller's investigation had concluded. None of the allegations in the case relate to Russian election interference or WikiLeaks' role in publishing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian intelligence operatives.An indictment against 12 Russians last year described WikiLeaks' role in publishing hacked emails in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Though the indictment said WikiLeaks had worked to coordinate the release of information, there was no allegation that the organization solicited the hacking of Democratic email accounts or worked with Russians.Assange's arrest provoked passionate responses overseas, and from some who had expressed concern about whistleblower protections, but the initial bipartisan reaction in Washington was relief."I'm glad to see the wheels of justice are finally turning when it comes to Julian Assange," tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally. "In my book, he has NEVER been a hero. His actions - releasing classified information - put our troops at risk and jeopardized the lives of those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan."And Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, said he hoped the British courts would quickly transfer Assange to U.S. custody "so he can finally get the justice he deserves."Assange's lawyer has previously said he planned to fight any U.S. charges against him. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 after he was released on bail in Britain while facing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations that have since been dropped. British police said Assange had been arrested Thursday for breaching his bail conditions and in relation to the U.S. arrest request.___Lemire reported from New York.

RB Leipzig are in third place on 58."I think we approached this game in a very serious way and we deserved to win by this score," said Bayern coach Niko Kovac, who used the same starting 11 as in their 5-0 demolition of Dortmund last week.There were some bad news for Bayern, however, with keeper Manuel Neuer taken off in the 53rd minute with a calf muscle injury."It is the same calf which had caused him problems recently," said Kovac. "We will check it tomorrow and hope it is not a serious injury."Bayern, in no mood to experience another 3-3 draw against Duesseldorf from earlier in the season, did not underestimate them this time and pressed high from the start.It paid off when Coman found space to cross into the box, Thomas Mueller failed get a foot on it and the ball sailed past keeper Michael Rensing into goal in the 15th minute.Bundesliga leading scorer Robert Lewandowski came close to adding another one in the 23rd but his free kick from the edge of the back flew narrowly wide.Despite more than 60 percent possession, the visitors struggled at times with an agile and hard-working Duesseldorf defence until Coman struck again four minutes from halftime for his fifth goal of the season.The Frenchman drilled in Joshua Kimmich's cutback, his 11th assist this season and the league leaders picked up after the break where they had left off with Serge Gnabry slotting in from a metre out in the 55th to give them a three-goal cushion.Bayern, chasing a record-extending seventh straight league title, could have scored several more in the second half but Rensing, a former Bayern keeper, made a string of superb saves.The hosts got a late consolation goal with a Dodi Lukebakio penalty from a Mats Hummels handball but Leon Goretzka scored Bayern' fourth in stoppage time.

The imagery triumphal. The villains all the same.A video shared on Tuesday by President Trump — until it was taken down, apparently over a copyright infringement complaint — left no doubt that his re-election would rest on a remobilization of the voters who put him into office, playing to a sense of their grievance against an elitist culture that looks down on them.And he did it while speaking no words.The president hit send on a two-minute video on Twitter from a supporter to his nearly 60 million followers as if to remind them why they backed him in the first place.In white words against a black backdrop, the frames scrolled by: “First They Ignore You,” “Then They Laugh at You,” “Then They Call You Racist.”The video opened with a tight shot of President Barack Obama, then cut to Hillary Clinton, both clearly cast as politicians who belittle Mr. Trump’s hard-line conservative base. It went on to show a headline that said Mr. Trump had been exonerated by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.And it added victory lap scenes of the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Brett M. Kavanaugh; a soaring Dow Jones industrial average and strong jobs numbers; churches and flags; and lots of faces of working-class white men.There was also plenty of footage of Mr. Trump, walking along as he did in the promotional ads for his television show “The Apprentice,” which helped catapult him to office.There were not, however, any scenes from the border with Mexico.The video apparently used music from the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises,” and BuzzFeed News reported that Warner Bros. had filed a complaint asking that it be taken down. Hours after Mr. Trump shared the video, it could no longer be viewed; a message said it had been “disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.”It was not immediately clear why Mr. Trump chose to tweet the video on a Tuesday afternoon, roughly nine months before any primary election votes are cast. What was clear was that Mr. Trump seemed to have no doubt that he would paint his campaign themes in black and white, and leave the gray to others.Reached Tuesday evening, Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, said that “we like to share content from die-hard supporters, and this is just another example of how hard Trump supporters fight for us.”Annie Karni contributed reporting.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexPoliticsSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperPolitics|Ex-Obama WH Counsel Charged With Lying in Lobbying ProbeAdvertisementSupported byEx-Obama WH Counsel Charged With Lying in Lobbying ProbeBy The Associated PressApril 11, 2019WASHINGTON — Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig was indicted Thursday on charges of making false statements and concealing information in a federal foreign lobbying investigation that intersected with the Russia probe.Craig, 74, was charged in a two-count indictment that accuses him of willfully concealing material facts from the Justice Department about work he performed for the Ukrainian government. The indictment, announced by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, came a day after Craig's lawyers said he expected to be charged in the probe spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.In a video statement, Craig said the prosecution against him was "unprecedented and unjustified" and that he's confident a judge and jury would agree."I did not participate in a scheme to mislead the government or conceal material facts," he said.His attorneys had called the case a "a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion" and said the Justice Department's national security division pushed to indict Craig despite federal prosecutors in New York declining to bring charges, an assertion that couldn't immediately be verified. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.Craig's indictment is part of a Justice Department crackdown on unregistered foreign lobbying and consulting. Federal prosecutors in New York have been investigating two prominent Washington lobbying firms in a similar probe, and Justice Department officials in Washington have been increasingly willing to prosecute people who they believe intentionally conceal their lobbying work from the government.The scrutiny of Craig stems from an investigation of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. The charges come about three months after Craig's former law firm agreed to pay more than $4.6 million and publicly acknowledge that it failed to register with the government for its work for the Ukraine.The civil settlement with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP laid much of the blame for the firm's conduct on Craig, who was a senior partner.Craig, who is set to appear in federal court Friday, is a prominent Washington attorney and was the first White House counsel to former President Barack Obama. In private practice, his clients have included former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and James Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was charged in a leaks investigation. He also led President Bill Clinton's White House legal team during his impeachment proceedings and defended Clinton during his Senate trial.The work that drew the Justice Department's attention occurred in 2012, when Craig and Skadden were hired by the Ukrainian government to write a report on the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister. Tymoshenko was a political opponent of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was a longtime Manafort patron.The report was billed as independent, but critics have said it whitewashed a politically motivated prosecution.In its settlement earlier this year, Skadden acknowledged it participated in a public relations campaign for the report and should have registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. The firm also acknowledged it had been paid $4.6 million for the report and not just $12,000, as the Ukrainian government had said at the time.The indictment made public Thursday says Craig did not want to register under FARA because doing so could keep him or others at his law firm from getting government positions and because the filing would require him to disclose the millions paid from a "private, wealthy Ukrainian." The disclosures also would have undermined the authority of the supposedly independent report.To help hide the private funding, Craig is accused of backdating and falsifying invoices at Manafort's request to make it appear the Ukrainian government was the sole funder of the report.After the firm's work attracted the attention of the Justice Department's FARA unit in 2012 and 2013, the indictment says Craig misled officials about his interactions with reporters and his involvement with a public relations firm in securing news media coverage about his law firm's report.When the Justice Department determined that Craig should register under the law, the indictment says, Craig resisted the idea. In an email titled "FARA," Craig wrote that the firm did not proactively disseminate the report to the media and instead provided it upon request to three media outlets that asked for it."The only time we responded, was to correct misinformation," Craig wrote. The firm then wrote a letter to the department's FARA unit containing Craig's false and misleading statements, which ultimately allowed for him and the firm to avoid registering, the indictment said.Years later, when the subject came up again during the Mueller probe, the indictment says Craig repeated some of the same lies during an October 2017 interview with the special counsel's team.Craig's lawyers deny that he lied to the government or his firm. They acknowledged that Craig spoke to reporters about the report but denied it was part of a public relations campaign that would run afoul of the law."I was always honest about the reasons for my contacts with the media," Craig said in the video posted Thursday on Twitter."I never discussed the finding of our report to any U.S. officials. I certainly did not lobby any US officials on behalf of Ukraine. I did not help Ukraine promote its spin when it released our report," he added.On Thursday, his attorneys, William Taylor and William Murphy, called the indictment "unfair and misleading" and said prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence. "Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration. That is what this trial will be all about," they said in a statement.FARA is a decadesold law meant to allow Americans to know when foreign entities are trying to influence public opinion or policymakers. The law, enacted in 1938 to unmask Nazi propaganda in the United States, requires people to disclose to the Justice Department when they advocate, lobby or perform public relations work in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign government or political entity.In the last few years, the Justice Department has brought several high-profile prosecutions involving FARA. That includes a case against Manafort, who was recently sentenced to more than seven years in prison.___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Desmond Butler contributed to this report.___Read the indictment: http://apne.ws/pOib8eWAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWe’re on the Air - The New York Times

You might know my name from the credits of the show — I’m the executive producer of “The Daily.”A year ago this week, our producers and editors huddled in a room one day to listen to that day’s episode. Instead of scrolling to find it in our podcast feed, we pulled up the homepage of a public radio station and heard those first hits of “The Daily” theme singing out strong. We were on the radio.When we first started the show, we hadn’t envisioned it living anywhere but a podcast feed. But when American Public Media came to us and asked, “What if ‘The Daily’ came to radio stations?” we thought, that’s brilliant. We have public radio in our DNA. Our founding team is full of former public radio folks: Lisa Tobin from WBUR, Andy Mills from “Radiolab” at WNYC, and me from “All Things Considered” at NPR. And we want to bring the news to as many people as we can, in as many places as we can.We currently make two versions of our episodes — one for the podcast, and one for radio. When Michael Simon Johnson, a producer for “The Daily” and “The New Washington,” and I were figuring out how to make the show work for broadcast, the biggest challenge we had was time. The time constraints on public radio are no joke: 20 minutes, 18 seconds. Everything we do has to fit in that window.So, every morning, a producer (usually Jonathan Wolfe, formerly a reporter on the Metro desk) and I whittle down the episode to the magic time. To do this, we employ all the best tricks we have. We’ll tighten some of the sound bites you hear from news anchors or politicians. We’ll trim down some of the longer bits of music. Whatever we do, we have to make sure we keep the emotional tug of the episode intact.A year in, we’re broadcasting the show to more than 140 stations across the U.S. Just this week, we added Guam to our map.

And I think what it’s so important for people to realize is that when we have a more representative school system, when we have a school system in which everyone has equal opportunity, that benefits all of us. That benefits us collectively as a society.”A few weeks ago, after New York City’s most selective public high school, Stuyvesant High School, offered admission to just seven black students (out of a class of 895), the Times reporter Eliza Shapiro interviewed nine students who attend the school.

Trouble is, they generally remain just that: secret tricks. Robert Caro — who began his career as a journalist and is now the most revered historian of his generation — generously offers up his tricks in a remarkable essay for The New Yorker.In it, Caro reveals the interview techniques used for his celebrated, multivolume biography about President Lyndon Johnson. When Caro found that the residents of Johnson’s tiny hometown in Texas were reluctant to open up to him, he took the unusual step of moving into their community — for nearly three years. No longer a stranger, Caro quickly earned their trust.When Caro realized that Johnson’s brother was sugarcoating a difficult childhood, he came up with a novel solution: He brought Johnson’s brother to the family’s childhood home (then a museum) and asked him to sit at the family’s kitchen table and recreate a typical dinner conversation with his father. Within minutes, the ugly truth of his father’s cruelty toward a young Lyndon Johnson poured out of him.Caro’s essay is a journalistic master class in how to build trust and draw out the truth.On “The Daily” this weekBrexit for her head?

We wanted to attack them early and we overran them," Bayern coach Niko Kovac said. "It was exactly what we had set out to do. We may have had some slip-ups this season but that happens."There were many critics of this team and that is why I am really happy for my players today."The first chance, however, fell to Dortmund with Mo Dahoud hitting the post after a lightning quick break.But that was the last Dortmund attack for a long time, with a glancing header by Hummels putting the host ahead in the 10th minute and highlighting their aerial superiority.In total Bayern had 22 shots on goal compared to Dortmund's four and things got worse when Dan-Axel Zagadou's backpass fell to Lewandowski in the 17th and the Bundesliga's leading scorer chipped it over keeper Roman Buerki and volleyed in.Poland's Lewandowski, who has scored 21 in the league this season, was the first player to break the 200-goal milestone since 1987.Buerki had to rescue his team again when Hummels and Lewandowski beat the Dortmund defenders in the air.The keeper denied Thomas Mueller from close range in the 41st minute but could do nothing to stop Martinez's rebound that put the hosts 3-0 up.Gnabry added another to kill off any hopes of a comeback by Dortmund, who badly missed their injured top scorer Paco Alcacer.Lewandowski notched his 21st goal of the season and 201st in the Bundesliga to put the cherry on top of a big win for Bayern which made them title favourites once more."This was clearly a lesson for us today," said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. "We have to accept it. They were faster, more aggressive, more skilled. We now must focus on the next game."

Watchdog’s Review of Russia Inquiry Is Nearly Done, Barr SaysImageThe Justice Department inspector general is examining the steps that law enforcement officials took to get a court’s permission to secretly wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser.CreditCreditPavel Golovkin/Associated PressBy Adam Goldman and Charlie SavageApril 9, 2019WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s internal watchdog intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign aide, Attorney General William P. Barr told lawmakers on Tuesday.The department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how law enforcement officials obtained a warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign with links to Russia. Mr. Horowitz’s investigators have also asked witnesses about informants that the F.B.I. turned to in the early stages of the investigation, according to people familiar with his inquiry.“The office of the inspector general has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russia investigation,” Mr. Barr said in testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee, using shorthand for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. “I expect that will be complete in probably May or June, I am told. So hopefully we’ll have some answers from Inspector General Horowitz on the issue of the FISA warrants.”A spokesman for Mr. Horowitz declined to comment on the timing of the expected report. But the inspector general has previously confirmed that he was looking into the early stages of the Russia inquiry, including wiretap applications, informants and whether any political bias against Mr. Trump influenced investigative decisions.Mr. Horowitz’s findings could once again upend the Justice Department and F.B.I., which have been at the center of a political firestorm since the 2016 presidential election over their handling of separate investigations into both Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. The highly anticipated results of the Russia inquiry are due to be made public “within a week,” Mr. Barr said on Tuesday.In the Russia investigation, Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the Page warrant because the application relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant.At issue is whether the F.B.I. and Justice Department made any misrepresentations to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when seeking the warrant, or if they should have flagged any concerns about the credibility of the information in the application during renewals. If the inspector general finds fault with the F.B.I., it could help validate Republican accusations that the Russia investigation was politically motivated.Mr. Trump’s allies have sought to reduce the inquiry to the problematic Steele dossier and to portray the Page wiretap application as its central feature. However, the bureau opened the counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s election meddling — including scrutinizing links to the Trump campaign — based on other information, and without the dossier.And the Page wiretap was only a small part of the broader Trump-Russia investigation: The inquiry involved more than 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants and about 500 witness interviews, Mr. Barr wrote in a letter to Congress describing the conclusions of the coming report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the investigation in May 2017.Law enforcement officials were also granted three renewals of the wiretap from the surveillance court; Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general and a Trump administration appointee, signed the last renewal application, which was granted in June 2017.As part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s relationship with Mr. Steele, who provided the politically charged information to the agents trying to determine whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates were secretly working with the Russian government’s campaign to meddle in the 2016 election.Top F.B.I. officials received the Steele information in September 2016 as they were debating whether to obtain the secret warrant to surveil Mr. Page. Among claims that Mr. Steele compiled from sources was that Mr. Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton during a visit to Moscow in July 2016 — an accusation Mr. Page has denied.Critics have argued that the court should have been explicitly told that the research was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, arguing that the court did not know that the information had potentially biased origins.Justice Department practice in filling out applications for secret wiretaps is to avoid naming Americans or American organizations, and the application contained a lengthy footnote alerting the court that an unnamed person who commissioned Mr. Steele’s research was “likely looking for information to discredit” Mr. Trump’s campaign.The footnote went on to explain to the court that Mr. Steele had “provided reliable information to the F.B.I.” in earlier investigations and that based on that history, the bureau believed his latest information was “credible.”The inspector general has also been examining Mr. Steele’s contributions to previous F.B.I.’s investigations, according to the people familiar with the inquiry. Investigators for Mr. Horowitz have asked about his role in helping the bureau investigate corruption at FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, suggesting that one focus of his is whether the bureau exaggerated Mr. Steele’s previous history with the bureau in its application to wiretap Mr. Page.One of the debates surrounding the F.B.I.’s use of information from the Steele dossier in the application is whether it was all crucial to meeting the standard for eavesdropping on Mr. Page’s phone calls and emails.Asked whether he would have signed off on submitting the application if it did not contain that allegation, James A. Baker, who was the general counsel of the F.B.I. when it first sought permission to wiretap Mr. Page, called the allegation about Mr. Page’s visit to Moscow in 2016 “an important” part of the factual case for surveillance.“I am not going to sit here and say that there wouldn’t have been probable cause or that there would have been probable cause without the dossier,” Mr. Baker told lawmakers in the fall who were scrutinizing law enforcement officials’ actions during the 2016 election, according to a
transcript of his testimony released on Tuesday.But, he also said, “there were other things in that application that to me were alarming, as well.”Another F.B.I. lawyer involved in obtaining the warrant, Sally Moyer, told the same committees in October that it was “a close call” but “I think we would have gotten there on probable cause even without the Steele reporting,” a transcript of her testimony showed.In publicly released documents, the F.B.I. said it had decided to end its relationship with Mr. Steele in November 2016 after he spoke to the news media about his work for the F.B.I. after bureau officials had asked him not to do so.The inspector general is also scrutinizing another early source of information for the Russia investigation, the people said: Mr. Horowitz’s investigators have been asking questions about the role of Stefan A. Halper, another F.B.I. informant, and his prior work for the bureau.Agents involved in the Russia investigation asked Mr. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain, to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser.However, Mr. Halper also had additional contacts with other Trump officials that have raised concerns about his activities. In one instance, Mr. Halper reached out to Sam Clovis, a Trump campaign aide; it was not clear whether Mr. Halper had the F.B.I.’s blessing to contact Mr. Clovis.Mr. Halper’s contacts have prompted Republicans and the president to incorrectly accuse the F.B.I. of spying on the campaign. Mr. Page has also said he met with Mr. Halper in mid-July 2016, about two weeks before the Russia investigation was opened.In addition, the inspector general is examining Mr. Steele’s contacts with Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official, according to the people familiar with the inquiry. Mr. Ohr, an expert on Russian organized crime and himself a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire, spoke with Mr. Steele several times after the F.B.I. terminated its relationship with the former British spy, and relayed information from those conversations to the bureau.Mr. Barr, who was sworn in two months ago, also said that as he was awaiting the outcome of that inquiry, he was studying the F.B.I.’s decision in 2016 to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign, “trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,” he said.

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States: “Our country is full.” But an aging population and declining birthrate among the native-born population — as well as underpopulated cities and towns — signal the complete opposite.• At Mr. Trump’s luxurious resorts in Florida, young foreigners on temporary visas work poolside, in bars and in spas. Workers without papers have maintained the golf course, hired through staffing agencies that protect the Trump Organization from liability.• The Trump administration denied that it would bring back the president’s policy of separating migrant families. It instead plans to push for tougher screening of asylum seekers, making it vastly more difficult for migrants to win protection in the United States.• In his first 100 days as the president’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr. Trump’s circle by encouraging, rather than restraining, the president’s conservative instincts.• Attorney General William P. Barr vowed on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the Mueller report “within a week.”• The Justice Department’s inspector general intends to complete his own investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry by May or June, including whether law enforcement officials abused their powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign aide.• Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s silence on a potential Israeli move to annex the West Bank was a break with previous administrations, which had discouraged any such action.• Israelis went to the polls Tuesday to elect a prime minister. According to preliminary results, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing likely indictment, appeared poised to beat his chief rival, Benny Gantz.• A congressional request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns has put one of his most loyal aides, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at the center of what is shaping up to be an extraordinary legal battle between two branches of the United States government.• Senator Bernie Sanders said that he would release 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday. And he acknowledged his best-selling book threw him into the ranks of the millionaires he has denounced for years.• How is a presidential campaign different from a presidential “movement”? It’s not really clear. But the latter is in vogue in the 2020 race.• Today’s Democratic Party is perceived as dominated by its left wing. But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate. Here’s a data-driven look at the party’s true, though underrepresented, ideology.• Facing opposition from both the Democratic Party’s liberal wing and fiscal hawks, House Democrats delayed voting on a two-year budget that would increase military and domestic spending.• In white words against a black backdrop, the frames scroll by: “First They Ignore You,” “Then They Laugh at You,” “Then They Call You Racist.” But the video, which Mr. Trump shared on Twitter on Tuesday — before it was taken down because of an apparent copyright complaint — was not a product of his 2020 campaign. Officials said it was made by a supporter._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

By Melina DelkicApril 4, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. A dispute over the Mueller report, how Rupert Murdoch’s empire of influence remade the world, and a class divide at the University of Southern California. Here’s the latest:ImageAttorney General William Barr at the White House on Monday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesMueller’s report was underplayed, some on his team saySome of the special counsel’s investigators told associates that the attorney general had failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry, and that they were more troubling for President Trump than he indicated, according to government officials and others familiar with the matter.The investigators had already written multiple summaries of the nearly 400-page report, and some team members believe that the attorney general, William Barr, should have included more of their material in the four-page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions. Mr. Barr only briefly cited the special counsel’s work in his letter.The officials declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel’s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr. Barr explained.Bigger picture: At stake in the dispute is who shapes the public’s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history. ImageThe Murdoch empire of influenceThe global media empire of Rupert Murdoch has helped destabilize democracy in North America, Australia and Europe, a Times investigation found.Our reporters examined how Mr. Murdoch’s media outlets, which include Fox News, have promoted right-wing politics and stoked reactionary populism in recent years. While the empire did not cause the global wave of right-wing populism, it enabled it, promoted it and profited from it. If you don’t have time to read The Times Magazine’s full, three-part investigation, read our takeaways.Scope: Mr. Murdoch’s outlets have pushed for Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U., the repeal of a carbon tax in Australia and the overthrow of an Australian prime minister.

Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOutrage greets Brunei’s anti-gay law A harsh new criminal law in Brunei — one that includes death by stoning for sex between men or adultery, and amputation of limbs for theft — is now in effect, despite an international outcry from other countries, rights groups, celebrities and students.Brunei, a tiny monarchy on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia, based the law on the most extreme interpretation of Shariah, an Islamic legal code drawn from the Quran and other writings.The reaction: Los Angeles officials and celebrities like George Clooney and Ellen DeGeneres have called for a boycott of nine hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei — three in Britain and two each in France, Italy and the U.S. ImageHeran Mamo, a senior at U.S.C., in her apartment in Los Angeles.CreditJenna Schoenefeld for The New York TimesWealth divides students on a California campusAn American college admissions scandal offered a window into the inequities of the application process. But what about the campuses themselves?Students at the University of Southern California, which figures prominently in the indictment in the scheme, described a vivid divide between rich and poor at their school, where students said they often worried they were being judged by their peers.“I have met these rich kids who have so much that I can’t comprehend, doing things that I can’t fathom,” one sophomore said. Details: Wealth on campus, for some, comes in the form of spring breaks in Bali, resort-style apartment buildings and regular group dinners out where tabs stretch into four digits. But it also bleeds into academics, with wealthier students having the option of private tutoring and access to their parents’ networks when looking for jobs and internships. Here’s what else is happeningBritain: Despite their antagonistic history, Prime Minister Theresa May and the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn came together on Wednesday to find common ground over a Brexit solution. The government appeared guardedly optimistic about the talks, while Mr. Corbyn was slightly less enthusiastic. President Trump: A House committee chairman has formally requested six years of the president’s tax returns, likely starting a momentous court fight. Malaysia: The trial of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, which began on Wednesday, is part of one of the biggest corruption cases ever to go to court. Some $4.5 billion was diverted from Malaysia’s public coffers.Turkey: Opponents of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are vowing to press ahead with an independent audit of Istanbul’s books. Mr. Erdogan and his party have run the city since 2002, and analysts and opponents say they have warped the economy through kickbacks and crony schemes.Egypt: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is extending his iron grip to a new corner of society: the country’s cherished soap operas. Philippines: A small-business owner on an island in the Philippines has become a local hero for pushing back against the growing number of international travelers who introduce themselves as “influencers” as a way to get free food, drinks and lodging.ImageCoral on the Great Barrier Reef.CreditDavid Gray/ReutersGreat Barrier Reef: Scientists thought the Great Barrier Reef, one of the earth’s most precious habitats, was “too big to fail.” A new study finds that climate change is testing its resilience.Carlos Ghosn: The former Nissan chief was arrested in Japan for a fourth time on Thursday on suspicion of using company funds for his personal ends.Tesla: The electric-car maker reported a 31 percent drop in deliveries for the first quarter. ‘Game of Thrones’: If you’re a fan of the HBO hit, whose final season premieres on April 14, you may want to check out a 110,000-square-foot interactive exhibition opening in Northern Ireland.

This week’s episode showed that yes, it can, though it still had to reach into its celebrity Rolodex to get it done.Jason Sudeikis, an “S.N.L.” alumnus, returned to his longtime role as Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, who this past week responded after four women said they were uncomfortable being touched by him. (The episode, hosted by the “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harington, also featured a couple of sketches lampooning that popular HBO fantasy drama.)In the opening sketch, Sudeikis met with two campaign aides, played by cast members Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson, who explained that they had an urgent matter to discuss with him.“Joe, it’s about all the touchy feely stuff,” Thompson said.Strong added, “If you’re really going to run in 2020, you have to change the way you interact with women.”Slipping back into his gregarious, oblivious portrayal of Biden, Sudeikis said, “You guys know that I’m a tactile politician, right? I’m a hugger, I’m a kisser and I’m a little bit of a sniffer. But the last thing I ever want to do is offend anyone.”His aides introduced him to a sensitivity-training consultant (Kate McKinnon), whom Sudeikis greeted by putting his nose and forehead against hers. “I’m just connecting,” he said.McKinnon replied, “So this is exactly the kind of thing that I’m here to prevent.”Sudeikis said that he, too, had recently taken a DNA test, just like “Lizzie Warren.” “It turns out that I’m one percent Eskimo so I’m allowed to do the kissing,” he said. He and McKinnon then talked through a couple of hypothetical scenarios when meeting people on the campaign trail.If he were to greet a woman with a handshake, Sudeikis asked, “What if during that handshake, I go ahead and I tickle her palm a little bit?”McKinnon replied, “I would say no tickling at all.”Sudeikis said, “Am I still allowed to do something like that gorgeous lift that they do at the end of ‘Dirty Dancing’?”Who would you do that with?, she asked him. He answered, “Hell, I don’t know. Whoever’s strong enough to pick me up, I guess.”Finally, Sudeikis was introduced to two prospective voters, the first played by Aidy Bryant. He put her in a headlock and gave her a noogie; she responded by punching him in the stomach. As she left the room, he said, “I have to say she’s still on the fence.”The second voter, played by Leslie Jones, greeted him enthusiastically. “You’re Obama’s granddaddy!” she exclaimed.Asked at the end of the exercise if he had learned anything, Sudeikis answered, “Not really, no. But the important thing, I think, is that I’m listening. I hear you and I feel you.” He proposed a campaign slogan: “Let’s hug it out, America — Biden and some woman in 2020.”Opening Monologue of the WeekFor Harington’s monologue,“S.N.L.” went with one of its most familiar gimmicks: having the host field questions from ringers in the studio audience. After an eerily clean-shaven Harington vowed that he wouldn’t reveal how “Game of Thrones” concludes, he nevertheless faced several variations on that question — from his “Thrones” cast mates.Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, said she’d already forgotten the ending to the show. “It’s been so damn long since the last season,” she said, adding: “Do you remember in Season 6 when we had sex? Did you know they filmed that?”John Bradley, who plays the hapless Samwell Tarly, asked him, “Do you think we’ll still hang out after the show is done, like best friends? What about next Tuesday, I could come around by 6 a.m.?”(Pete Davidson, in costume as the villainous, undead Night King, wanted to know: “Do people hate me? Because it really feels like they hate me.”)Finally, Rose Leslie, who played Ygritte and is Harington’s real-life wife, asked him, “What are we going to do for money now?”The Other ‘Game of Thrones’ Sketch of the WeekIn a fake HBO commercial, “S.N.L.” imagined the cable network’s future after “Game of Thrones” is over: a lineup saturated with “Thrones”-related prequels, sequels and spinoffs.Those shows included “Castle Black,” a moody, “Riverdale”-style drama about the forbidden romance between Jon Snow (Harington) and a female white walker (Heidi Gardner); an animated series in the style of MTV’s “Daria,” called — what else? — “Arya”; a sitcom called “The Queen of King’s Landing”; as well as “Cersei and the City”; “The Marvelous Mrs. Melisandre”; and a crime procedural, “Game of Thrones: Special Victims Unit,” starring Mariska Hargitay and Ice-T.Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on Biden’s troubles and the legal battle over the final report of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.CHE:Four women have come forward claiming that Joe Biden touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. And yeah, I could see that. He looks like one of those uncles that calls spring ‘Sundress Time.’ It’s very disappointing, but older people, in general, have a problem with boundaries. There’s a lady in my building who’s like 75. And every time I see her, she grabs my arm and says something dirty. It’s very uncomfortable but I let her because she’s hot.JOST:On Wednesday, Biden released a video responding to the allegations, and I’m not sure that it helped. Yeah, so it was supposed to be an apology, not a re-enactment. Also, the look of the video is so weird. Why is it shot vertically? It looks like something from a premium, adults-only Snapchat. And of course nothing puts women at ease like a man on a leather couch who’s already taken off his tie. He might as well end the video by unbuttoning his shirt and saying, ‘to find out what happens next, log onto GoDaddy.com.’And then a pro-Trump group released a new ad saying that Biden’s behavior with women is unacceptable and should instantly disqualify him from running. The group’s name is Independent Republicans of New York, or IRONY.CHE:The House Judiciary Committee voted to subpoena the full, unredacted Mueller report from the White House. Man, I really wish I knew about redacting when I was in school. I probably would have graduated. “I did my report, it’s just redacted right now.” If Donald Trump stole his presidency, why don’t we just steal it back? If I was running for president, I would be in Putin’s DMs right now, negotiating. Why is everybody trying to play fair with this guy? Even the F.B.I. Oh, you didn’t find anything? Then plant it, you’re the F.B.I. Just turn off your body cam and put some crack in his shoes, man.British Political Satire of the WeekImageIn a Brexit segment, Kate McKinnon played Theresa May emoting to a song by Sara Bareilles.CreditSteven Molina Contreras/NBCNot to neglect the political turmoil on the other side of the Atlantic, “S.N.L.” cast McKinnon as Theresa May, the British prime minister, trying to keep her spirits up after Parliament rejected numerous plans to withdraw the nation from the European Union.In a filmed segment set to the Sara Bareilles song “She Used to Be Mine,” McKinnon walked through the streets of Britain, drawing nasty looks from her fellow citizens and some obscene gestures from royal guards. As the sketch went to increasingly surreal extremes, we also saw McKinnon performing an interpretive dance while dressed in a Union Jack body suit, and taking an imaginary twirl with Winston Churchill (likely the only time we’ll ever see Kit Harington play this role).AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsThe Snake Lady and the Masters: Augusta Imagines Life Post-Strip Clubs - The New York Times
SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexU.S.SubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperU.S.|The Snake Lady and the Masters: Augusta Imagines Life Post-Strip ClubsAdvertisementSupported byThe Snake Lady and the Masters: Augusta Imagines Life Post-Strip ClubsIt is hard to imagine Augusta without Whitey Lester, a downtown fixture for decades and the city’s last strip-club impresario. By Richard Fausset and Steve CrawfordApril 8, 2019ImageThe Masters Tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club is a hallowed yearly pilgrimage for golf fans.ImageThe Discotheque Lounge, one of Whitey Lester’s downtown strip clubs.By Richard Fausset and Steve CrawfordPhotographs by Hilary SwiftAUGUSTA, Ga. — “Folks,” the radio host wrote on his Facebook page, “reports of Whitey Lester’s death were apparently incorrect.”It was just before Christmas, and the host, Austin Rhodes, was in the awkward position of retracting his on-air announcement about James Lester, who is known to everyone in Augusta as Whitey — and who remains very much alive.It was a cringe-worthy error. But it also set off a mini-explosion of civic speculation about what Augusta, derided as “Disgusta” by detractors, might eventually be like without Mr. Lester, downtown’s very last strip-club impresario, the man whose businesses have for decades offered a lubricious counterpoint to the Masters Tournament, the hallowed yearly pilgrimage for golf fans hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club that begins this week.Bartenders, strippers, real estate speculators, golf fans, preachers and politicians — they are all wondering what a post-Whitey Lester world might look like, and whether his clubs really would go with him.Despite reports that Mr. Lester, who is in his mid-70s, has been in ill health, his son, Butch Lester, said in a brief interview that his father was nowhere near death, and he lamented that so much seemed to turn on the matter.“That’s a lot of fuss for one man living or dying,” he said.But it is hard to imagine the town without him. It was Mr. Lester who was responsible for the regionally famous striptease act known as The Snake Lady, an unholy pretzel of human and reptilian flesh that titillated many a golfer, soldier and late-teenage boy. The dancer and a boa constrictor or two would emerge with the “Jaws” theme playing. A voice would announce a visitor from the “Devil’s den.”ImageThe Joker Lounge, also known as Vegas Showgirls, in Augusta, Ga.ImageThe Discotheque Lounge on Broad Street.He was the obvious go-to quote for The New York Post in 2010 when it trumpeted the 19th-hole hot-cha-cha that has long defined Augusta’s relationship with its famous golf tournament.For years, Mr. Lester was also a headline-generating juggernaut for the local paper. He was the man who defied Bible Belt convention and survived a career in the cross hairs of evangelical Christians, prudish city officials, and even — in that odd way that the long putt of history sometimes breaks — an assistant United States attorney general named Robert S. Mueller III.These days, according to his critics, Mr. Lester is also standing in the way of progress. His detractors contend that his two strip clubs along Broad Street, the Discotheque Lounge and Vegas Showgirls, are the last seedy obstacles hindering a downtown revitalization that might finally help Augusta shed its reputation as a sort of unglamorous urban crust around the sparkling green geode that is the Augusta National.“We don’t want to continue to be the butt of jokes,” said Matt Aitken, a former member of the city-county commission and a real estate agent who has a number of properties listed near Mr. Lester’s clubs. “We want to be on the cutting edge of economic prosperity, and to be cool.”A former mill town of 200,000 people about a two-hour drive east of Atlanta, Augusta has waited a long time for its makeover. Its urban core suffered more than most, not only from suburbanization, but fire, floods and a bitter 1970 race riot. For decades, the downtown was defined by empty storefronts, pawn shops, and places like the Discotheque, the more famous of Mr. Lester’s clubs.But now, finally, there is energy. There is a fledgling tech sector, helped along by the planned move of the United States Army’s Cyber Command headquarters from Virginia to nearby Fort Gordon. There is a handsome new $40 million convention center and a lovingly restored 1940 theater. There are pedestrians. There is a restaurant on Broad Street that serves quail bisque and pork belly rillette.ImageMarketplace Antiques on Broad Street sells memorabilia from the Augusta National Golf Club.It all starts to taper off the closer one gets to the block with the strip joints, to the chagrin of the real estate agents dreaming of lofts and coffee shops. That block “is like a big missing tooth in the whole city,” said Jonathan Aceves, an agent and head of the neighborhood association for Olde Town, the residential area just to the east.But the fate of that block of Broad Street and the mortality of Mr. Lester are tangled like woman and snake. The law made it so. In 1994, when six strip clubs were operating downtown, city officials made it illegal for nude clubs to serve alcohol. But they allowed the owners of the existing clubs, including Mr. Lester, to keep their alcohol licenses until the clubs closed or the owner died.And so everybody waits.They do not mean anything personal by it. But “people made business decisions based on the fact that these clubs would eventually close,” said Joe Edge, president of Sherman & Hemstreet, the company where Mr. Aitken works.ImageChildren playing on the Augusta Common in downtown Augusta.Augusta is the birthplace of the Southern Baptist Convention and, predictably, many have wanted Mr. Lester gone. In 1986, the mayor at the time, Charles A. DeVaney, was livid when a photo book meant to celebrate America’s cities — and sponsored by the United States Conference of Mayors — used a picture of the Discotheque to illustrate the city.“Savannah gets the river, Macon a beautiful fountain and Augusta gets a nightspot that advertises a snake lady,” Mr. DeVaney complained.In 1991, city leaders, still on the warpath, passed a law that banned nude dancing in clubs that sold alcohol. But the Discotheque management filed a court challenge and got an injunction, and the Georgia Supreme Court eventually ruled the law unconstitutional.The next year, Mr. Lester faced his biggest test when he was indicted on four counts of underpaying federal income tax, part of a four-year investigation into what federal officials believed was an illegal gambling operation being run out of the Discotheque and a cavernous pool hall Mr. Lester owns next door called Riverfront Pub & Sports.According to court documents, Mr. Mueller authorized the local United States attorney’s office to apply for an order allowing the wiretap of Mr. Lester’s office. The Discotheque and the pool hall were seized and padlocked by federal officials on a Friday morning in February. The authorities also seized hundreds of thousands of dollars — and hauled away the snakes.More than a dozen people pleaded guilty to gambling charges as part of the inquiry. But the civil and criminal cases against Mr. Lester went nowhere. His properties were returned to him on April 3, just before the start of that year’s Masters Tournament.Benjamin E. Nicholson V, one of Mr. Lester’s lawyers at the time, said that Mr. Lester was relieved to open just before the crush of Masters traffic. “Whitey had a contingent of Japanese that would spend a million bucks at the Masters,” Mr. Nicholson recalled, “and that made his year.”ImageBamboo and tall fences surround the Augusta National Golf Club.Mr. Nicholson recalled that one snake died in federal custody and taxpayers compensated Mr. Lester handsomely for it.When it comes to the local power structure, Mr. Lester has always counted powerful friends among his enemies. Few were surprised when, in 2012, he served as an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of the longtime local sheriff. And few were surprised when, in the run-up to this year’s Masters Tournament, city officials briefly considered a proposal that would allow Mr. Lester to pass his license down to family members.When Mr. Edge caught wind of the proposal, he raised hell, and filed an online petition opposing it. It garnered 1,500 signatures and the idea went nowhere.While it is legal to operate a strip club beyond downtown in Augusta’s industrial zones, none have opened because of a prohibition on liquor licenses. But this week, amid concerns that tourism might be impacted by a dearth of strip clubs, Augusta commissioners agreed to lift the prohibition. It was not immediately clear whether the Lester family would move their businesses.On a recent afternoon at the Riverfront Pub, an employee eating chicken fingers at the bar said that Mr. Lester was not available for comment. The place was covered with photos reflecting a life in the nimbus of a certain kind of fame.One photo featured Mr. Lester, bearded and smiling and looking like a roadie for a Southern rock band, next to the basketball legend Scottie Pippen. There were photos of gamblers and golfers and expert billiard players named Weenie Beanie and Cornbread Red. There was a photo of Muhammad Ali, signed by the legend: “To Mighty Whitey,” it says. “Good luck.”Later that night at the Discotheque, Gina Virella, 32, a dancer, said she was studying to be a nurse. She was not too worried about her future. Some of the other dancers, she said, would have to move out of town when the place closed.There was trap music on the sound system, and a framed newspaper article from the day Mr. Lester beat the feds.There was also a framed cartoon that showed a lady from the local chamber of commerce with brochures on all of the attractions Augusta wants its visitors to see.“Yeah those places sound great,” a bug-eyed male visitor tells her, “But what I’m really looking for is the famous Discotheque!!!”Richard Fausset is a correspondent based in Atlanta.

Samuel Patten, 47, and prosecutors had asked for leniency, citing his cooperation in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and other ongoing probes. The sentencing comes as federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate foreign donations to the Presidential Inaugural Committee and as the Justice Department has been cracking down on foreign lobbying violations.Separately, prosecutors filed charges Thursday against former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, accusing him of lying to the government to conceal his own work on behalf of the government of Ukraine. Craig denies wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty Friday.In Patten's case, he pleaded guilty to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act for lobbying on behalf of the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party. He also admitted to orchestrating a $50,000 straw-donor scheme to purchase tickets from the inaugural committee on behalf of a wealthy Ukrainian client. Federal law bars such committees from accepting foreign donations, a fact Patten has admitted he knew when he violated the law.Later, Patten also misled the Senate intelligence committee about his conduct when asked to provide documents and testimony as part of the panel's investigation of Russian election interference.U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was most troubled by Patten's lies to the committee and likely would have given him a short prison sentence under other circumstances.But she credited him for cooperating with the government and for taking responsibility for his actions, something the judge said "doesn't happen every day in this courtroom."Jackson said Patten's conduct was also "markedly different" from that of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who carried out a years-long conspiracy to launder money, evade U.S. tax authorities and covertly influence American policy makers on behalf of Ukrainian interests. Jackson imposed a sentence earlier this year that led to Manafort facing about seven years in prison."There are reasons why your sentence is not going to be like his sentence," she told Patten, as she also imposed a $5,000 fine and 500 hours of community service.Prosecutors didn't fully detail Patten's cooperation or say whether he has helped as part of the inaugural committee investigation. In court papers, Patten's attorney, Stuart Sears, said his client wasn't part of a larger scheme to funnel foreign money to the inaugural committee and isn't a Trump supporter.Patten helped with the Manafort investigation and was slated to testify in his case before the Manafort pleaded guilty last year. The two men shared an associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, who was Patten's business partner and a Manafort co-defendant.The FBI said Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, an allegation he denies. Kilimnik, who lives in Russia, was indicted alongside Manafort on charges of witness tampering but has not appeared in a U.S. court.Craig's case also relates to the Manafort investigation.Manafort was involved in the financing of a report Craig and his law firm authored for the Ukrainian government. The document sought to legitimize the prosecution of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.Craig, 74, is accused of misleading the Justice Department about his interactions with reporters and his involvement with a public relations firm in securing news media coverage about the report.Craig, who served as President Barack Obama's first White House counsel and previously defended President Bill Clinton during his Senate trial, denies those allegations. Craig has called the prosecution against him "unprecedented and unjustified."In a tweet Friday, President Donald Trump complained that Craig's case wasn't covered on the front page of The New York Times.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsJulian Assange, Sudan, Black Hole: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’ve got breaking news on two continents today, a crisis at the southwestern border, and a new Brexit deadline.ImageJulian Assange in a police van after he was arrested in London today.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersU.S. charges Julian Assange, hours after his arrestThe WikiLeaks founder faces one count of conspiracy to hack a computer related to his role in the 2010 release of classified U.S. documents, according to court documents unsealed today shortly after his arrest in London. He was arrested at the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had lived since 2012, after Ecuador withdrew the asylum it had granted him.President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador said that his country had decided to stop sheltering Mr. Assange after “his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols.” The background: After WikiLeaks released the classified material in 2010, Mr. Assange, 47, took refuge in the embassy two years later to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced questions about sexual assault allegations. He is also suspected of aiding Russian interference in the 2016 election by releasing material stolen from the Democrats.ImageSudanese soldiers stood guard as thousands protested in Khartoum, the capital.CreditAgence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLongtime Sudanese leader is forced outThe country’s military ousted President Omar al-Bashir today, ending a 30-year authoritarian rule in the face of mass street protests.Mr. al-Bashir, 75, is accused of war crimes and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in connection with genocide in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands were killed. He was taken into custody, the government was dissolved and the Constitution suspended, the defense minister said.Some of the protesters called for caution while awaiting a statement from the military.“The uprising continues,” a spokeswoman said, adding that they would continue “until there is a complete step down of the whole regime.”Go deeper: Mr. al-Bashir liked to play up his humble origins to project a folksy image that contrasted with his image in the West, where he was often seen as a heartless warmonger.ImageMigrants lining up for food in Matamoros, Mexico, last week.CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesMigrants pour into a system that’s “on fire”There had been warnings for years that America’s immigration system was on the brink of failure.That moment may have arrived: The country is now failing to provide either necessary humanitarian relief or basic controls on the number and nature of who comes in.By the numbers: At the current pace of nearly 100,000 migrants a month, officials say more than a million people will have tried to enter the country in a 12-month period. The flow of migrant families has reached record levels — as many as 27,000 children are expected to arrive in April.Voices: “Infectious disease is everywhere,” a Border Patrol union leader said. “It’s dangerous for our agents. It’s dangerous for the detainees that don’t have anything.”Trump campaign was spied on, attorney general saysWilliam Barr said on Wednesday that the government had surveilled Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and that he was preparing to review “both the genesis and the conduct” of that inquiry. “I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” he said.Mr. Barr also offered more details of the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, adding that he hoped to release the redacted report next week.Yesterday: The Treasury Department declined to immediately give President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, saying it needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request. Here’s what we might learn from the documents.Looking ahead: Gregory Craig, a White House counsel during the Obama administration, is expected to be indicted on charges related to his work for Ukraine, his lawyers said. The case stemmed from an investigation initiated by Mr. Mueller’s office.From Opinion: The boundaries of privacyAs companies and governments gain new abilities to follow people across the internet and around the world, the costs and benefits of technological advances are becoming clearer.The Times is beginning a project to explore the debate around those changes.See for yourself: What do you think should be private?

By Melina DelkicApril 10, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with the election in Israel, an investigation of the Russia investigation and comedic rebellion in Venezuela.ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with his wife, Sara, waving to supporters at his Likud party headquarters on Tuesday night.CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesNetanyahu appears to pull ahead in electionBy early Wednesday, with most of the votes counted, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel appeared poised to win a fourth consecutive term in office, after a tight race with his main rival, Benny Gantz, a centrist former military chief.A count of the broader blocs needed to form a coalition government gave Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party a clear advantage over Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White. Check back here for updates.Heated race: Many Israelis said it was the nastiest and most divisive race they could recall.Mr. Netanyahu appealed primarily to the right, fanning the flames of anti-Arab sentiment, warning Israelis that Mr. Gantz would “hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs.” Mr. Gantz reached out for allies across the political spectrum, promising to restore a sense of unity, decency and democratic values.Big picture: Victory would provide Mr. Netanyahu a renewed mandate as he battles a looming indictment on charges of bribery and corruption. ImageAttorney General William Barr, right, arrived to testify before the House Appropriations Committee in Washington on Tuesday.CreditErin Schaff/The New York TimesAn investigation of the Russia investigationThe inspector general, a watchdog for the Justice Department, intends to finish by May or June his inquiry into whether law enforcement officials abused their powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign aide during the Russia inquiry. Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers that the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, was looking into the warrant obtained to wiretap Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Takeaway: If the inspector general finds fault with the F.B.I., it could help validate Republican accusations that the Russia investigation was politically motivated and draw scrutiny of any new conclusions in the Mueller report.Mueller report: Mr. Barr promised lawmakers today that he would release to them the special counsel’s findings “within a week.” He said he would be transparent about redactions, but he declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the report.ImageMick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, in the Oval Office on Tuesday.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesA White House gatekeeper who lets Trump be TrumpFor the first time since taking office, President Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president’s conservative instincts.Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, is a former South Carolina congressman and a leader of the Tea Party caucus. To Mr. Mulvaney’s critics, including some Republicans, his approach has unleashed the president in dangerous ways.When Mr. Trump decided to get rid of his Secret Service director, officials said, Mr. Mulvaney delivered the message. When Mr. Trump considered whether to ask a court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act — despite opposition from his own top legal advisers — Mr. Mulvaney’s response: Follow your gut.Impact: Some outsiders see signs that Mr. Mulvaney is pushing Mr. Trump to the right. But insiders say he is merely liberating Mr. Trump to pursue the courses he prefers anyway.ImageA supporter raised a picture of Prime Minister Imran Khan during an election campaign rally in Karachi, Pakistan, last year.CreditShakil Adil/Associated PressPakistan’s leader seeks to weed out militantsPrime Minister Imran Khan gave an hourlong interview to foreign journalists in which he sought to project resolve, including on one of the biggest issues he faces.“We have decided, for the future of our country — forget the outside pressure — we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore,” he said.He acknowledged that “the Pakistan Army created them,” referring to the 1980s, when Pakistan and the U.S. backed Muslim insurgents in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.Backdrop: An international watchdog group, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, is on the brink of blacklisting and leveling sanctions against Pakistan over the militias, which would make it more difficult for the country to obtain financial bailouts and loans.If you have 11 minutes, this is worth itA 1960s Boeing design, revampedImageThe Boeing 737, in 1968, the year after it was christened.CreditBettmann, via Getty ImagesThe Boeing 737 Max jet that had two fatal crashes in five months relied on decades-old systems and left pilots without some common safety features.“It was state-of-the-art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,” said a former engineer who helped design the Max’s cockpit. “It’s not a good airplane for the current environment.”Here’s what else is happeningBritain: Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to get a Brexit delay approved, but European leaders are insisting that Mrs. May explain how she would put that time to constructive use.

On Tuesday, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers both raised their eyebrows at Biden’s continued advantage in early polls despite the women who have said he made unwanted physical contact with them.“A new poll has Joe Biden leading the Democratic field. It’s a tricky situation: Some people think Biden’s too inappropriate with women to beat the other Democrats, and yet still not inappropriate enough to beat Trump.” — JIMMY FALLON“According to a new poll, former Vice President Joe Biden is favored among Democratic primary voters. That’s right, he’s the hands-down favorite. No, Joe — put your hands down!” — SETH MEYERSCreditCreditVideo by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy FallonConan O’Brien pointed out that Biden has plenty of competition. On Monday, yet another Democrat joined the race: Representative Eric Swalwell.“There are now 18 Democrats running for president, and more are on the way, they said. Yes, in fact, for this month only, if you announce you’re running for president you can get all-you-can-eat crab legs at Red Lobster.” — CONAN O’BRIEN“You have to admit one thing about Donald Trump: He literally makes everyone think they could be president. It’s an amazing power.” — CONAN O’BRIENHomeland InsecurityTwo days after Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out as secretary of homeland security, touching off a firing spree across her former department, Stephen Colbert mused about who might take those jobs.“It is going to be tough to find people to fill those positions. If only there was a group of folks willing to do jobs Americans don’t want to do.” — STEPHEN COLBERTColbert said the administration’s lack of success in containing the flow of people across the southern border explained President Trump’s frustration.“There’s been a huge spike in illegal immigration since he took office, and he looks like an idiot. Not sure which one of those things came first.” — STEPHEN COLBERTStolen HardwareJames Corden played video of a man in California who was shown stealing a chain saw from a hardware store by stuffing it down his pants.“The suspect got away. Police are describing him as medium height, medium build and extremely circumcised.” — JAMES CORDENThe Punchiest Punchlines (Barr Edition)“During a recent meeting about immigration with top officials, Trump was ‘ranting and raving, saying border security was his issue.’ Sir, don’t sell yourself short.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.No Longer ‘in Limbo’The late-night hosts all lined up to bid good riddance to Kirstjen Nielsen, the former secretary of homeland security, who resigned on Sunday under pressure from President Trump.During her tenure, Nielsen oversaw the White House’s crackdown at the southern border and became the public face of the administration’s controversial family-separation policy. The three major late-night hosts each had his own way of sending her off.“Goodbye, Kirstjen. Whoever replaces you permanently is going to have some very big cages to fill.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Now, Nielsen’s departure is not a total shock. Reportedly, for weeks, Nielsen has felt ‘in limbo.’ Limbo is the right word here, because we’ve all been watching just how low she can go.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting from a CNN report“Nielsen said that this was the right time to step down and she looks forward to spending more time separating her family.” — JIMMY FALLONCreditCreditVideo by The Late Show With Stephen ColbertTrevor Noah said that Nielsen might have a hard time finding work in the private sector after the role she played in the administration.“Nielsen is leaving this White House with her reputation in tatters. Remember, she was the face of the Trump administration’s family separation policy, where kids were split from their parents and kept in cages. So basically, the only job she can get now is working for R. Kelly.” — TREVOR NOAH“Since Trump took office, a record number of people have left the White House. Which, even for Trump, is pretty impressive. It’s almost like he’s leading the resistance by himself. Everyone out there is like, ‘We gotta get these people out of office!’ And Trump is like, ‘Way ahead of you folks. Resist!’” — TREVOR NOAH‘You Can’t Just Turn It Down’As Democrats in Congress and in New York State attempt to wrest Trump’s tax returns from his grasp, he has insisted that he is under audit and therefore cannot release the returns. Seth Meyers called for him to finally make them public.“It’s a congressional request. You can’t just turn it down like hors d’oeuvres at a party. ‘You’ve been served.’ ‘Oh, no thank you, I’ve already had 100 Big Macs.’” — SETH MEYERS“Trump is the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns. And without them we have no idea where he’s getting money from or who he owes money to. Which is crazy — he’s the president! You’d want to know if your doctor had a side business running a mortuary. ‘Your test results were negative, but just in case, have you thought about a wood casket? Pine is very nice.’” — SETH MEYERSThe Punchiest Punchlines (Biden Edition)“McDonald’s will no longer serve Filet-O-Fish sandwiches after midnight. If you’re someone who’s eating Filet-O-Fish at McDonald’s after midnight, this might be a good time to re-evaluate your life choices.” — JIMMY FALLON“I think Joe Biden just doesn’t get it. Which is great news for him, because guys who just don’t get it is one of the most powerful voting blocs in America.” — TREVOR NOAH, after watching footage of Joe Biden telling jokes about his habit of being physically affectionate with women in professional scenariosThe Bits Worth WatchingJeff Goldblum makes a completely worthless — but lovable — tax adviser.After a Red Sox player was injured by his 2-year-old son, Jimmy Kimmel decided he wanted to hear both sides of the story.What We’re Excited About on Tuesday NightChelsea Handler — who has been speaking candidly of late about her feelings about Robert Mueller — will sit down with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday.Also, Check This OutImageDaenerys Targaryen, played by Emilia Clarke, in “Game of Thrones.”CreditMacall B.

Here’s What’s at Stake.AdvertisementSupported byLetter 101An Australian Election Is Imminent. Here’s What’s at Stake.ImageVoting in Parramatta, Australia, in 2016. Australians will go to the polls again next month.CreditCreditCole Bennetts/Getty ImagesBy Jamie TarabayApril 4, 2019The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.___Australians will go to the polls next month to elect a new government, and because elections take place as soon as 33 days after they’re officially called, the country’s politicians will have to move quickly to solidify votes.Whoever takes the helm will have to contend with a set of challenges that mirror those of other democracies around the world.Here’s a look at some of the key domestic and international issues that we’ll be watching and that Australia’s leaders will be confronting.Election MeddlingIn February, Australia became the latest Western nation whose institutions had most likely been tampered with after the government acknowledged that Parliament’s computer network had been hacked by a foreign government.No country has been named as being behind the cyberattack, but security experts say China, Russia, and possibly Iran and North Korea are among the suspects.Officials said the three major political parties were among those affected, but wouldn’t say to what extent, because they hadn’t seen anything like this breach before. Even as he said a “sophisticated state actor” was behind the attack, Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted there was “no evidence of any electoral interference.”Australian elections are quick, they are compulsory and the majority of voters will cast their ballots on paper. However, during the last federal election, some areas used electronic lists to check voters’ names off electoral rolls. It’s not yet known if those electronic lists will be used in light of the recent hack.ChinaThe Australia that will go to the polls in May is markedly different to the one that voted in 2016, particularly when it comes to China. Then, the Australian economy was on fire, Chinese investment had surged to a new high, and while the government blocked some Chinese bids for infrastructure projects, it was a record-setting year for deals with Chinese companies.For years, the Australian government had been able to successfully navigate its economic ties with its largest trading partner, China, and its strategic relationship with its greatest ally, the United States, without having to compromise on either.But a slew of events have redefined Canberra’s relationship with Beijing. In 2017, a prominent Australian senator, Sam Dastyari, resigned over accusations of lobbying for Beijing and taking money from Chinese-born political donors. The government passed a foreign interference law, requiring lobbyists for other countries to register and disclose their activities — one of many efforts to push the Chinese government’s soft-power campaign out of the shadows.And in August, Australia banned Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, from participating in the building of a fifth-generation telecommunications network.Politicians have been reluctant to explicitly discuss the China challenge up till now, but pressure will continue to build no matter who wins the election.The EnvironmentIt was ostensibly energy policy that led to Malcolm Turnbull becoming the third prime minister in 10 years to lose the job — a dispute about addressing climate change prompted the change.But the public is far less divided. A recent poll found that 59 percent of Australians are concerned about climate change and frustrated at the lack of initiative from Canberra to address it.Several independent candidates are running in key electorates — including the former head of a clean energy corporation who is campaigning for the seat won last time by Josh Frydenberg, the treasurer.Even so, the two main political parties have staked out vastly different positions on climate change. The Labor Party has said that there will be no new coal-powered plants if it wins, but the Coalition has not ruled them out. Labor also supports a 45 percent emissions target by 2030, while the Liberal Party said that it is committed to 26 percent by 2030. Labor has also promised rebates for households installing solar batteries and wants 50 percent of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030.Mr. Morrison says he will spend billions of dollars on a hydroelectricity project to help alleviate rising power bills and offset carbon emissions. He has criticized the opposition’s policies, arguing that higher emissions targets would “crash the economy.”ImmigrationAs President Trump calls for funding to build a wall on the Mexico border, Mr. Morrison continues to boast of his role in stopping boats full of asylum seekers heading to Australia, and now wants to limit the number of skilled migrants who come to the country legally each year.The move to reduce the current cap on immigration by nearly 30,000 people is seen as a step back by many. The country has relied on immigrant labor to fuel its economic boom as its population has grown to 25 million. The move also represents a reversal for Mr. Morrison, who pushed back against cutting the cap before he became prime minister.The Labor Party, on the other hand, wants to increase the annual refugee intake from 16,250 to 27,000 by 2025 and said it would stick to the current migration cap should it win.But the issue of immigration has created a heated debate in Australia, as voters and politicians ask: How much of the opposition to immigration comes from concerns over strained infrastructure in cities, and how much comes from racism, Islamophobia and fear?A senator recently made global headlines when he blamed Muslim immigration for the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.Mr. Morrison has had to deflect criticism of his party as anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim. When asked if the Coalition had a problem with Islamophobia, he said: “As leader, my job is to set the right tone. And the tone I have set, you can see from my experience. My example has been to work with the Muslim community very deeply.”So what’s the most important issue for you this election? Share it with us at nytaustralia@nytimes.com.Now, on to some reader responses and other highlights from The Times this week.____Deceptive Journalism: Readers RespondImageThe One Nation party officials Steve Dickson, left, and James Ashby tried last Tuesday to explain comments recorded by a reporter undercover for Al Jazeera.CreditDave Hunt/EPA, via ShutterstockMany of you weighed in on our examination last week of Al Jazeera’s undercover investigation on the National Rifle Association and whether it was ethical. Thanks to all who wrote in or shared in our Facebook group. Here’s a few of your responses.“I am all for journalists using deception if it is the only way to expose something as serious as the activities of the gun lobby and One Nation. We heard them say to put nothing in a recordable form that can be investigated in any accepted way, including by law enforcement, so if they are being so deceptive, deceptive journalism is the only way to find the truth.” — Helen O’Dea“One assumes that the job of journalists is to uncover the truth. If you ask people (particularly One Nation people) questions, they will lie to you. This method worked a lot better as a means to expose what One Nation really stand for. I like it. Would I like it if some of my political allies were shown up as a bit grubby? Well not as much, but its still a legitimate technique.” — John Brookes“Your ethics guide is right. The last thing you want is to be accused of deception in pursuit of a story as that diminishes the validity of said story.“The issue of what, and who makes the determination, is in the public interest is equally as important. The case of the N.R.A. and One Nation is a clear-cut case of foreign intervention in our democratic process. That is a concern and definitely in the public interest.“But there are cases, no doubt, that are less clear, which begs the question: how does the NYT decide what is in the public interest? Sticky area!” — Ian Baxter____Australia and New ZealandImageCreditPhoto illustration by Joan WongDon’t miss our mammoth three-part investigation into one of the most influential figures alive today: How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World.The reporters visited three continents, including Australia, and interviewed more than 150 people to unveil the story of a dysfunctional family that has toppled governments and destabilized democracies.
