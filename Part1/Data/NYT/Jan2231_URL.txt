By Elizabeth DrewMs. Drew is a journalist based in Washington who covered Watergate.Dec. 27, 2018ImageA billboard asking people to sign a petition calling for the impeachment of President Trump in Times Square in New York last year.CreditCreditJustin Lane/European Pressphoto AgencyAn impeachment process against President Trump now seems inescapable. Unless the president resigns, the pressure by the public on the Democratic leaders to begin an impeachment process next year will only increase. Too many people think in terms of stasis: How things are is how they will remain. They don’t take into account that opinion moves with events.Whether or not there’s already enough evidence to impeach Mr. Trump — I think there is — we will learn what the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has found, even if his investigation is cut short. A significant number of Republican candidates didn’t want to run with Mr. Trump in the midterms, and the results of those elections didn’t exactly strengthen his standing within his party. His political status, weak for some time, is now hurtling downhill.The midterms were followed by new revelations in criminal investigations of once-close advisers as well as new scandals involving Mr. Trump himself. The odor of personal corruption on the president’s part — perhaps affecting his foreign policy — grew stronger. Then the events of the past several days — the president’s precipitous decision to pull American troops out of Syria, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s abrupt resignation, the swoon in the stock market, the pointless shutdown of parts of the government — instilled a new sense of alarm among many Republicans.The word “impeachment” has been thrown around with abandon. The frivolous impeachment of President Bill Clinton helped to define it as a form of political revenge. But it is far more important and serious than that: It has a critical role in the functioning of our democracy.Impeachment was the founders’ method of holding a president accountable between elections. Determined to avoid setting up a king in all but name, they put the decision about whether a president should be allowed to continue to serve in the hands of the representatives of the people who elected him.The founders understood that overturning the results of a presidential election must be approached with care and that they needed to prevent the use of that power as a partisan exercise or by a faction. So they wrote into the Constitution provisions to make it extremely difficult for Congress to remove a president from office, including that after an impeachment vote in the House, the Senate would hold a trial, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction.Lost in all the discussion about possible lawbreaking by Mr. Trump is the fact that impeachment wasn’t intended only for crimes.
For example, in 1974 the House Judiciary Committee charged Richard Nixon with, among other things, abusing power by using the I.R.S. against his political enemies. The committee also held the president accountable for misdeeds by his aides and for failing to honor the oath of office’s pledge that a president must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”The current presidential crisis seems to have only two possible outcomes. If Mr. Trump sees criminal charges coming at him and members of his family, he may feel trapped. This would leave him the choice of resigning or trying to fight congressional removal. But the latter is highly risky.I don’t share the conventional view that if Mr. Trump is impeached by the House, the Republican-dominated Senate would never muster the necessary 67 votes to convict him. Stasis would decree that would be the case, but the current situation, already shifting, will have been left far behind by the time the senators face that question. Republicans who were once Mr. Trump’s firm allies have already openly criticized some of his recent actions, including his support of Saudi Arabia despite the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and his decision on Syria. They also openly deplored Mr. Mattis’s departure. It always seemed to me that Mr. Trump’s turbulent presidency was unsustainable and that key Republicans would eventually decide that he had become too great a burden to the party or too great a danger to the country. That time may have arrived. In the end the Republicans will opt for their own political survival. Almost from the outset some Senate Republicans have speculated on how long his presidency would last. Some surely noticed that his base didn’t prevail in the midterms. But it may well not come to a vote in the Senate. Facing an assortment of unpalatable possibilities, including being indicted after he leaves office, Mr. Trump will be looking for a way out. It’s to be recalled that Mr. Nixon resigned without having been impeached or convicted. The House was clearly going to approve articles of impeachment against him, and he’d been warned by senior Republicans that his support in the Senate had collapsed. Mr. Trump could well exhibit a similar instinct for self-preservation. But like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump will want future legal protection.Mr. Nixon was pardoned by President Gerald Ford, and despite suspicions, no evidence has ever surfaced that the fix was in. While Mr. Trump’s case is more complex than Mr. Nixon’s, the evident dangers of keeping an out-of-control president in office might well impel politicians in both parties, not without controversy, to want to make a deal to get him out of there.RELATEDOpinion | Thomas L.

Mueller III, a former F.B.I director, is known to dislike meandering investigations that languish for years.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “Mueller Disputes Report That Trump Directed Cohen to Lie” (news article, Jan. 19):After President Trump’s astonishing deference to Vladimir Putin on Russian sanctions, election meddling, Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, undermining NATO and more, any reasonable observer must be concerned that Mr. Trump may have been — wittingly or unwittingly — compromised by a hostile foreign state.Robert Mueller is thus in the midst of the most important and delicate counterintelligence investigation in modern American history.Mr. Trump lives and dies by the news cycle. According to many published sources, stories about Russian interference inflame Mr. Trump’s temper. We have already seen him fire lifelong loyal Republicans over “this Russia thing.”Journalists should be more sensitive to these dynamics. They should avoid sensational scoops that could compromise delicate sources or trigger further obstruction. BuzzFeed’s careless “big story” distracted the investigation, or worse.Mr. Mueller’s team had no choice but to take the unusual step of publicly disputing the BuzzFeed article. Right now, figuring out how Russia compromised our elections is the job of Mr. Mueller’s team. Let’s stay out of its way.Christopher ThorpeMillbrae, Calif.To the Editor:Re “Russia Dealings Said to Continue Till Trump Won” (front page, Jan. 21):We shouldn’t be too hard on BuzzFeed. Because of its story, which still may prove true, Rudy Giuliani admitted that, despite President Trump’s public protestations to the contrary, negotiations on a Moscow Trump Tower continued throughout the 2016 election campaign until at least Election Day. (Mr. Giuliani has since claimed that his statements were “hypothetical.”) Mr. Giuliani further admitted that Mr. Trump might have talked to Michael Cohen before Mr. Cohen testified before Congress. When Mr. Cohen untruthfully told Congress that the Moscow deal terminated in January 2016, the president did not tell Congress or the American people that Mr. Cohen had not been truthful. A reasonable prosecutor might well conclude that such conduct corroborated the BuzzFeed story. Without organizations like BuzzFeed, Americans might know a lot less about the dangers to our democracy.Sharon MorrisonWhitefish, Mont.To the Editor:It looks as if Robert Mueller just had a James Comey moment: He entered the public discussion when he should have continued to keep his mouth shut. Why in the world would he say anything about the BuzzFeed article about President Trump directing Michael Cohen to lie to Congress? All he does is show that he and his team are following the click-bait news like so many of the rest of us.If BuzzFeed has it wrong, that will be revealed soon enough. Peter J. HouseSeattleTo the Editor:The buzz in print and on TV from BuzzFeed’s report that President Trump instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress was loud and intense. It is unfortunate but ironic that Mr. Trump, who trades on his followers’ willingness to believe the falsehoods he so frequently utters, should suffer such public relations damage from his opponents’ readiness to accept BuzzFeed’s apparently erroneous report.I’m tempted to think it serves him right.Jamie BaldwinRedding, Conn.To the Editor:Substantiated or not, whether he did it or not, no one, not even most of his staunch supporters, would put it past President Trump to order an associate to lie to Congress. And that subordination of norms and ethical character alone condemns him.Lyndon DoddsSan AntonioTo the Editor:Re “The Man Who Wouldn’t Be President,” by Frank Bruni (column, Jan. 20), questioning whether Donald Trump actually wanted to win the election:So, a man realizes that by failing he’ll come out richer than if he had succeeded. Sounds like Mr. Trump took his game plan from Bialystock and Bloom, those bumbling Broadway producers dreamed up by that brilliant political strategist Mel Brooks.Josh TaneBriarcliff Manor, N.Y.

Whitaker, the acting attorney general, ended a news conference on charges against Huawei by saying he thought the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was nearing an end.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesBy Sharon LaFraniere and Katie BennerJan. 28, 2019WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, announced on Monday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is wrapping up his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow’s operation.“The investigation is, I think, close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible,” Mr. Whitaker said.His impromptu remark, at the end of a news conference about an unrelated case, was a highly unusual confirmation of the state of the special counsel’s investigation. Justice Department policy ordinarily prohibits public comment on open criminal inquiries, and Mr. Mueller has refused to publicly discuss the investigation since he was appointed in May 2017 to oversee it.Mr. Whitaker, who is considered intensely loyal to President Trump, said that he had been “fully briefed on the investigation” and that he looked forward to Mr. Mueller delivering a report.Mr. Whitaker’s comments appeared to take even Justice Department officials by surprise. As soon as he described the special counsel’s work as nearly over, a spokeswoman shut down the news conference, declaring hastily: “That’s all the time for today. Thank you so much.”It was unclear whether Mr. Whitaker had discussed his comments with Mr. Mueller beforehand, or if he was speaking off the cuff. A spokesman for Mr. Mueller, Peter Carr, declined to comment.Prosecutors typically shy away from discussing the progress of investigations to avoid unfairly framing public expectations, partly because new evidence could unexpectedly arise. Mr. Whitaker acknowledged that tradition before giving his assessment of Mr. Mueller’s progress. “I am really not going to talk about an open and ongoing investigation,” he said.Mr. Whitaker’s remarks “may be harmless,” said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. Nonetheless, she said, “There isn’t any advantage in announcing you are close to the end. You might think that you are close, and then your very last witness leads you to five new witnesses.”Mr. Whitaker comment’s came on the heels of the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, on Friday on charges of witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to Congress about efforts by the Trump campaign to learn about how WikiLeaks might damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Trump and His Associates Had More Than 100 Contacts With Russians Before the InaugurationDonald J. Trump and at least 17 of his associates repeatedly had interactions with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition.The new indictment was issued as Mr. Mueller’s team has pushed other criminal cases toward sentencing, including those against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, and Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser.Mr. Manafort’s sentencing on his conviction on financial crimes, which was scheduled for next month, was delayed on Monday, according to a court filing. No new date was set. He was still scheduled to be sentenced in March in Washington on two conspiracy charges.In a possible sign that Mr. Mueller could close up shop before Mr. Stone’s case is resolved, prosecutors from outside the special counsel’s team were listed among those who will represent the government in court. Mr. Stone is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday in Washington.Mr. Whitaker has been temporarily leading the Justice Department since Mr. Trump forced Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general late last year. Mr. Trump’s nominee to replace Mr. Sessions, William P. Barr, is widely expected to be confirmed.Under Justice Department regulations, Mr. Mueller is required to give the attorney general “a confidential report” explaining his prosecutorial decisions when he has finished his investigation. The attorney general, in turn, must send a report to Congress explaining why the work has concluded, though that can simply be a brief summary.At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said that if confirmed, he would want to make as much of the special counsel’s report public as possible. But he added that he needed to learn more before making any decisions.On Monday, two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced legislation that would require the special counsel to report his findings and underlying evidence directly to Congress when the investigation is complete, or if the special counsel is fired.The bill, written by Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, stands little chance of becoming law. Nonetheless, it reflects a strong sentiment in Congress that Mr. Mueller’s findings ought to be aired fully.Even as they eagerly anticipate those results, lawmakers are plunging ahead with their own investigations. On Monday, another congressional panel, the House Intelligence Committee, announced that it had reached an agreement to question Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer. Mr. Cohen, who has been convicted of financial misdeeds, lying to Congress and violating federal election law, will be queried behind closed doors on Feb. 8 about his work for the president.The Senate Intelligence Committee has also subpoenaed Mr. Cohen for a private session, and a third panel, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is weighing whether to subpoena him to testify publicly. Citing concerns about his family’s safety, Mr. Cohen unexpectedly withdrew his offer to testify before the oversight committee next week.He has also changed his legal counsel, an adviser announced on Monday. Mr. Cohen is replacing Guy Petrillo, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, with Michael Monico, a former assistant United States attorney from the Northern District of Illinois, and Barry Spevack, a veteran criminal defense lawyer.Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Mueller’s Real Target in the Roger Stone IndictmentAdvertisementOpinionSupported byMueller’s Real Target in the Roger Stone Indictment It was probably not Stone himself, but rather his electronic devices.By Julian SanchezMr. Sanchez is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.Jan. 26, 2019ImageRoger Stone in Washington in December 2018.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesFor many, Friday’s arrest of Roger Stone, the veteran political trickster and longtime adviser to Donald Trump, was a sign that the special counsel investigation into Russian electoral interference is entering its final phase. Yet there were also several indications that the probe may not be as near its conclusion as many observers assume — and that the true target of Friday’s F.B.I. actions was not Mr. Stone himself, but his electronic devices.Mr. Stone’s early-morning arrest at his Florida home unsurprisingly dominated coverage, but reports also noted that federal agents were “seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stone’s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided.” The F.B.I., in other words, was executing search warrants, not just arrest warrants. Even the timing and manner of Mr. Stone’s arrest — at the absolute earliest moment allowed under federal rules of criminal procedure without persuading a judge to authorize an exceptional nighttime raid — suggests a concern with preventing destruction of evidence: Otherwise it would make little sense to send a dozen agents to arrest a man in his 60s before sunrise.The indictment itself — which charges Mr. Stone with witness tampering, obstruction of justice and false statements to Congress — takes little imagination to translate into a search warrant application, and also hints at what Robert Mueller might be looking for. In describing the lies it alleges Mr. Stone told a House committee, the document places great emphasis on Mr. Stone’s denial that he had any written communications with two associates — associates with whom he had, in fact, regularly exchanged emails and text messages. That’s precisely the sort of behavior one might focus on in seeking to convince a recalcitrant judge that an investigative target could not be trusted to turn over documents in response to a subpoena, requiring the more intrusive step of seizing Mr. Stone’s devices directly.Of course, as the indictment also makes clear, the special counsel has already managed to get its hands on plenty of Mr. Stone’s communications by other means — but one seeming exception jumps out. In a text exchange between Mr. Stone and a “supporter involved with the Trump Campaign,” Mr. Mueller pointedly quotes Mr. Stone’s request to “talk on a secure line — got WhatsApp?” There the direct quotes abruptly end, and the indictment instead paraphrases what Mr. Stone “subsequently told the supporter.” Though it’s not directly relevant to his alleged false statements, the special counsel is taking pains to establish that Mr. Stone made a habit of moving sensitive conversations to encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp — meaning that, unlike ordinary emails, the messages could not be obtained directly from the service provider. The clear implication is that any truly incriminating communications would have been conducted in encrypted form — and thus could be obtained only directly from Mr. Stone’s own phones and laptops. And while Mr. Stone likely has limited value as a cooperating witness — it’s hard to put someone on the stand after charging them with lying to obstruct justice — the charges against him provide leverage in the event his cooperation is needed to unlock those devices by supplying a cryptographic passphrase.Of course, Mr. Mueller is likely interested in his communications with Trump campaign officials, but the detailed charges filed against the Russian hackers alleged to have broken into the Democratic National Committee’s servers also show the special counsel’s keen interest in Mr. Stone’s communications with the hacker “Guccifer 2.0,” an identity said to have been used as a front for the Russian intruders. By Mr. Stone’s own admission, he had a brief exchange with “Guccifer” via private Twitter messages. On Mr. Stone’s account, Guccifer enthusiastically offered his assistance — at the same time we now know Mr. Stone was vigorously pursuing advance knowledge of what other embarrassing material stolen from Mr. Trump’s opponents might soon be released — and Mr. Stone failed to even dignify the offer with a reply. With no easy way of getting hold of “Guccifer’s” cellphone, searching Mr. Stone’s devices might be the only reliable way for the special counsel to discover whether the conversation in fact continued on a more “secure line.”Yet if Mr. Mueller is indeed less interested in Mr. Stone than the potential evidence on his phones and computers, the conventional wisdom that the special counsel probe is wrapping up — and could issue a final report as soon as next month — seems awfully implausible. Digital forensics takes time, and a single device could easily hold many thousands of messages to sift through. And if this really is the first time Mr. Mueller’s office is seeing the most sensitive communications from a key figure like Mr. Stone, it’s likely they’ll come away with new leads to follow and new questions to pose to other witnesses. We may ultimately look back on Mr. Stone’s arrest not as the beginning of the special counsel’s endgame, but the point when the investigation began to really heat up.

Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, appeared in court on Tuesday on charges in the special counsel investigation.CreditCreditPete Marovich for The New York TimesBy Mark Mazzetti and Adam GoldmanJan. 29, 2019WASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to felony charges in the special counsel investigation during a brief federal court appearance in which the often flamboyant Mr. Stone appeared solemn and said little.During the 15-minute proceeding, a lawyer for Mr. Stone, Robert C. Buschel, entered the plea on his client’s behalf to charges of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements. After the hearing, Mr. Stone declined to comment to a throng of reporters following him through the courthouse and outside.In a detailed indictment unsealed last week, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, accused Mr. Stone of lying to investigators for the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own inquiry into the Russian election interference campaign, and of pressuring another witness in that investigation to lie to the committee.The indictment also said that Trump campaign officials dispatched Mr. Stone to make contact with WikiLeaks during the summer of 2016, when the website was releasing a trove of damaging information about Hillary Clinton that had been stolen by Russian intelligence operatives.Mr. Mueller has not accused Mr. Stone of playing a role in the hacking, and Mr. Trump and his allies have pointed out that the indictment does not make a case that the Trump campaign engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to disrupt the election.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, has been charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He was arrested in a pre-dawn F.B.I. raid in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and appeared in court on Friday.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesProsecutors from the United States attorney’s office in Washington will try the case in tandem with Mr. Mueller’s team, Jeannie Rhee, one of the special counsel prosecutors, said during Tuesday’s hearing. The move suggested that Mr. Mueller might be eyeing an eventual shift of the case to the United States attorney’s office as the Russia investigation winds down. On Monday, Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, told reporters that he believed it was close to its conclusion.Mr. Stone, known for outlandish outfits, wore a prim suit with a dark blue, knitted tie, and his refusal to comment after his hearing Tuesday was a reversal of his stance in recent days. On Friday, hours after the F.B.I. conducted a raid on his Florida home, he stood on the steps of a courthouse in Fort Lauderdale and declared he would be “completely vindicated.”“There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,” Mr. Stone said then, before flashing twin V-for-victory hand signs made famous by his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon.Mr. Stone embarked on a media blitz afterward, giving numerous interviews over the weekend about his case and accusing Mr. Mueller’s investigators of hounding him and his associates.He said that the messages cited in the indictment that he exchanged with Randy Credico, a longtime New York radio personality who was also called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, were made in jest and taken “out of context."“I never told Mr. Credico to lie,” he said on Sunday during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”As he exited the courthouse on Tuesday, Mr. Stone looked at reporters and pointed toward the exit, appearing to signal them to an area outside where he could talk. But the mayhem that greeted him outside — dozens of cameramen and protesters holding signs — quickly crowded him into the back seat of a sport-utility vehicle, which drove him away from the courthouse. Mr. Stone never commented.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.

Here’s What We Know About the Mueller CaseAdvertisementSupported byA Conspiracy or Not? Here’s What We Know About the Mueller CaseImagePresident Trump’s longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. was charged on Friday in a case that revealed an effort by Trump campaign officials to learn about WikiLeaks’ cache of stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 election.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesBy Sharon LaFraniere and Michael S. SchmidtJan. 26, 2019WASHINGTON — The indictment unsealed Friday against President Trump’s longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. raised anew the perennial question about the Russia investigation: Will any Trump associate be charged for what Mr. Trump loves to refer to as collusion?Mr. Stone, the indictment said, conveyed information to the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, the group that released thousands of Democratic emails and other documents in the months before the 2016 election. The Russians had stolen that material and delivered it to WikiLeaks as part of its broad effort to interfere in the American presidential election.But the indictment secured by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, does not contend that Mr. Stone’s efforts to connect with WikiLeaks were illegal. Instead, Mr. Stone was charged with lying to Congress about those efforts and trying to pressure an associate not to expose his lies.[Read the indictment against Mr. Stone.]Mr. Trump’s legal team likes to say that “collusion” is not a crime. But that is a purely semantic argument because a “conspiracy” between two or more people or entities to commit an offense is a crime.The question is whether Mr. Mueller’s team will find evidence that the Trump campaign agreed to work with WikiLeaks or the Russian government, or both, in a conspiracy to violate some statute — such as laws that make it illegal to hack private information or that bar foreigners and foreign entities from expending resources to influence American elections.Why was Mr. Stone not charged in a conspiracy with WikiLeaks?The indictment said that senior Trump campaign aides contacted Mr. Stone “to inquire about future releases” by WikiLeaks during the summer of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. Mr. Stone responded, telling the Trump campaign about potential disclosures from WikiLeaks.Given that the Democrats had publicly stated as early as June 2016 that they believed Russian operatives had infiltrated their computers, the Trump campaign’s eagerness to benefit from pilfered documents might seem distasteful. But merely being in touch with WikiLeaks does not rise to the level of a crime, former prosecutors said.Even if Trump campaign aides knew that the Russian government had funneled the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, the campaign would not be criminally culpable, they said. Knowing about someone’s else crime is a far cry from committing one.What, then, would constitute a crime?It is illegal for campaigns to accept foreign contributions, including services, which are considered in-kind donations. WikiLeaks is considered a foreign organization. So hypothetically, if the Trump campaign were actively involved in a scheme with WikiLeaks to bolster its own campaign, that might be a violation of the Federal Election Commission rules against foreign contributions.But at a minimum, that would require evidence that the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks was trying to damage Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, agreed with that objective and engaged in overt acts to further the scheme.“Two or more people have to agree to do something that the law forbids, and at least one of them has to take a step to further the conspiracy — an overt act,” said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official.What might constitute an “overt act”? If Trump campaign officials coordinated with Julian Assange, the organization’s founder, on the timing and content of the document releases in an effort to maximize the damage to the Clinton campaign, that might qualify. But Mr. Mueller has offered no evidence of that.Will charges come later?Maybe. Mr. Rosenberg cautioned against viewing Mr. Stone’s indictment as the final word on whether the Trump campaign did or did not conspire with WikiLeaks. “I wouldn’t take from the fact that they didn’t charge it that they can’t charge it or that they won’t charge it,” he said.The special counsel has mounted two criminal cases claiming illegal schemes to tilt the election results, both against Russians. Legal experts cited those cases as possible templates for what a conspiracy case involving the Trump campaign might look like, assuming the evidence existed to bring one.Thirteen Russians and three Russian companies were accused of conspiring to defraud the United States by illegally influencing the presidential election. That indictment said the Russians mounted an illicit social media campaign aimed at sowing political discord, undercutting Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump. Their activities were illegal because foreigners cannot spend money to influence American elections or engage in political activity in the United States without registering with the Justice Department.In the other case, Mr. Mueller charged 12 Russian military officers with hacking into Democratic computers and releasing tens of thousands of stolen documents, using WikiLeaks and other means. That case alleged a conspiracy to commit computer crimes.If WikiLeaks and Russia conspired, doesn’t that implicate the Trump campaign?As Mr. Trump’s director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo branded WikiLeaks a stateless hostile intelligence unit eager to do the bidding of Russia and other American adversaries.But the special counsel has not, so far, said that WikiLeaks was acting as an agent of the Russian government during the 2016 presidential race, much less claimed that the Trump campaign knew it was dealing with a Russian agent.It is not even entirely clear that WikiLeaks knew the source of its information was Russia. Russian operatives transferred the pilfered documents to the organization using a fake online persona, Guccifer 2.0.Mr. Stone himself defended WikiLeaks last year in a cable news interview. Asked if working with the organization would be treasonous, he replied: “No, actually, I don’t think so because for it to be a treasonous act, Assange would have to be probably a Russian asset and WikiLeaks would have to be a Russian front, and I do not believe that is the case.”Whether prosecutors think so is unclear. Last year, the Justice Department inadvertently revealed that it had secretly charged Mr. Assange, but it remains unclear for what crimes. Mr. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for years for fear of criminal prosecution.Is Mr. Trump in any legal jeopardy on the WikiLeaks front?The president publicly encouraged Russian operatives to infiltrate Mrs. Clinton’s emails during the 2016 campaign, saying they would “probably be rewarded mightily by our press” if they uncovered the messages. That same day, Russian hackers tried to break into servers that housed the emails for Mrs. Clinton’s personal office, according to court documents Mr. Mueller filed last year.But that alone is far from enough to land Mr. Trump in legal hot water.Legal experts said that prosecutors would need evidence that the Russians and Mr. Trump were working together — not merely that he encouraged computer espionage.“It’s can’t just be cause and effect, there has to be some type of agreement — whether explicit or implicit — that shows they were working together and prosecutors would have to have the evidence to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Joyce Vance, a professor of law at the University of Alabama and former United States attorney.Follow Sharon LaFraniere and Michael S.

Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, appeared in court on Tuesday on charges in the special counsel investigation.CreditCreditPete Marovich for The New York TimesBy Maggie HabermanJan. 31, 2019President Trump said on Wednesday that he would not intervene with the Justice Department’s decision-making process about whether to release the report by the special counsel investigating possible collusion with Russian officials in the 2016 campaign.“They’ll have to make their decision within the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office interview with the website The Daily Caller. “They will make the decision as to what they do.”He insisted that he had not spoken with Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, about the closing days of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“I could’ve taken a much different stance. I could’ve gotten involved in this. I could’ve terminated everything. I could’ve ended everything,” the president said.“I’ve chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right if I wanted to to end everything,” he added. “I could’ve just said, ‘That’s enough.’ Many people thought that’s what I should do.”Mr. Trump’s remarks came days after Mr. Whitaker told reporters that he believed the inquiry was nearing its end.“The investigation is, I think, close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible,” Mr. Whitaker said at the end of a news conference about an unrelated case.Since the special counsel was appointed in May 2017, it has been rare for senior Justice Department officials to comment publicly about the Russia inquiry.Under Justice Department rules, Mr. Mueller must explain his prosecutorial decisions in a “confidential report” to the attorney general once his investigation has ended. The attorney general must in turn send a report to Congress indicating why the work has been completed, though that can consist of only a brief summary.But it remains unclear whether the report will ever be publicly released. In his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, raised the possibility that it might not be.For weeks, Mr. Trump’s advisers have signaled that they believed that the special counsel’s investigation was almost over, but Mr. Mueller’s team has never given any indication about its timing.The special counsel is examining whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election. United States intelligence agencies have said that Russians tried to disrupt the election in support of Mr. Trump, but the president has repeatedly cast doubt on the role that Russia played.Last week, Mr. Mueller’s team indicted Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump’s on-and-off political adviser for more than 30 years, and a key architect of the president’s campaign platforms in its early days. The charges included one count of obstruction of justice, one count of witness tampering and five counts of making false statements to Congress.Mr. Stone quit the Trump campaign in 2015, well before the first primary race votes were cast. But he is the most recent figure connected to the campaign to be charged by the special counsel.Several campaign associates have been charged with lying to investigators. None have been charged with collaborating with Russians, a point that Mr. Trump’s team repeatedly stresses.AdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsWhat Is Brexit?

What Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens Next
By BENJAMIN MUELLER
UPDATED March 29, 2019
Peter Nicholls/Reuters
With Parliament still unable to decide on any approach to Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union — its biggest peacetime decision in decades — the government remains in crisis and the nation continues to rush toward the departure date without a plan in place.
On Friday, British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for withdrawing from the European Union for the third time. This means that Britain is moving closer to a departure date of April 12 without a deal -- a scenario that many fear will be economically damaging.
Already companies are jumping ship. Fears of medicine shortages in a no-deal departure are rising.
Many options, from the daringly complete break with no deal to abandoning Brexit altogether, remain on the table, but Parliament already has weighed several alternatives, and voted all of them down.
The European Union agreed recently to postpone the original Brexit deadline, March 29, saying that if Mrs. May could win passage of her deal by then, Brexit would take effect on May 22.
Otherwise, there will be the potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit on April 12, unless both sides agree by then on a much longer delay, to allow a more fundamental reconsideration of their divorce.
What ultimately emerges could determine the shape of Britain and its place in the world for decades. Following is a basic guide to Brexit, what it is, how it developed into the mess it is today and how it could ultimately be resolved.
What is Brexit?
A portmanteau of the words “Britain” and “exit,” Brexit is shorthand for Britain’s split from the European Union, changing its relationship to the bloc on trade, security and migration.
Britain has been debating the pros and cons of membership in a European community of nations almost from the moment the idea was broached. It held its first referendum on membership in 1975, less than three years after it joined.
In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron promised a national referendum on European Union membership with the idea of settling the question once and for all. The options it would offer were Remain and Leave, and Mr. Cameron was convinced that Remain would win handily.
On June 23, 2016, as a refugee crisis made migration a subject of political rage across Europe and amid accusations of lies and fraudulent tactics by the Leave side, Britons voted for a hazily defined Brexit by 52 percent to 48 percent.
Not only did that not settle the debate, but it saved for another day the tangled question of what should come next. Now, that day may finally be arriving.
How did Britain vote?
England and Wales voted for Brexit, overcoming support to remain in the European Union in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. See a detailed map of the vote.
Why is it such a big deal?
Europe is Britain’s most important export market and its biggest source of foreign investment, and being in the bloc has helped London cement its position as a global financial center. Every day, it seems, a major business announces or threatens plans to leave Britain after it quits the European Union, including Airbus, which employs 14,000 people and supports more than 100,000 other jobs.
The government expects the country’s economy to grow anywhere from 4 to 9 percent less than it would inside the bloc over the next 15 years, depending on how it leaves.
Mrs. May has promised that Brexit will end free movement, the right of people from elsewhere in Europe to move to Britain and vice versa. That is a triumph for some working-class people who see immigration as a threat to their jobs, but dispiriting for young Britons hoping to study or work abroad.
What’s holding it up?
Undoing 46 years of economic integration in one stroke was never going to be easy, and the Brexit process has been bedeviled by the same divisions that led to the referendum in the first place. Both Britain’s main parties, the governing Conservatives and the Labour opposition, are divided over what to do, leaving Parliament so factionalized that there may be no coherent plan most lawmakers would back.
Mrs. May spent 18 months negotiating a divorce deal with the European Union, shedding one cabinet minister after another in the process. Her plan would keep customs and trade arrangements with the bloc until at least the end of 2020, but ultimately envisions cutting most of those ties. It does not detail what would replace them in Britain’s future relationship with the European Union.
When she presented the plan to Parliament in January, it was rejected by a historic margin of 230 votes. When she tried again in March, she fared less badly, but the pact was still soundly defeated, 391 to 242.
We keep hearing about the Irish border. What’s that about?
The single greatest hangup is the question of Britain’s only land border with the European Union -- the invisible line between Ireland, another member state of the bloc, and Northern Ireland, which remains part of the United Kingdom.
Mrs. May and her Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, want to prevent checkpoints from going up at the border; such barriers are generally seen as incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement, which brought respite from decades of violence in Northern Ireland.
But the method she agreed for guaranteeing that — called “the backstop” — has alienated much of Parliament.
The backstop would keep the whole United Kingdom in a temporary trading relationship with Europe until a final deal avoiding a hard border could be agreed on, something that hard-line Brexiteers fear would never happen.
And it would bind Northern Ireland to even more European rules, to the dismay of those who reject any regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom like the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, whose 10 lawmakers give Mrs. May her parliamentary majority.

Why is Brexit in the news?
With the widely feared prospect of a no-deal Brexit coming closer, Mrs. May made a last-ditch bid this week to win support for her deal.
She said this week that if Parliament accepted it on her third try, she would step down, setting off a frenzy of speculation about a successor and jockeying for position among the contenders in her Conservative Party.
At the same time, Parliament took an extraordinary step of its own, holding a series of votes over the prime minister’s objections to try to agree on another approach. The effort fizzled; lawmakers rejected all eight options they considered.
Some of the steps Parliament weighed lost only narrowly, with many lawmakers abstaining, making it unclear what would have happened if everyone had voted.
Just about the only clear decision Britain has made on Brexit since the 2016 referendum was to give formal notice in 2017 to quit, under Article 50 of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty, a legal process setting it on a two-year path to departure. That set March 29, 2019, as the formal divorce date, now pushed back to April 12.
Mrs. May has yet to find a way to overcome seemingly impossible parliamentary arithmetic and get lawmakers to back her agreement with European leaders.
The fantasy that Brexit would be easy has crumbled, and lawmakers who made lofty promises to their constituents are having to face hard reality.
What are the alternatives?
Mrs. May could tack to the center by committing to a permanent trading relationship with Europe — a customs union — that would do away with tariffs and quotas. That way, she would solve the Irish border dilemma and possibly win some votes from opposition Labour lawmakers.
That would be a softer Brexit than the one she negotiated, with Britain, remaining closely tied to the European Union’s tariffs and product standards.
But that would enrage the right-wing lawmakers in her party and risk splitting the Conservatives, which she wants to avoid at all costs. So she has instead tried to win over the hard-liners who want a harder Brexit, with fewer ties to the bloc.
Of the options considered this week by Parliament, the one it came closest to endorsing was a soft Brexit approach, remaining in the European Union’s customs union. It lost, 272 to 264, but more than 100 lawmakers abstained, so it is anyone’s guess how the vote would have gone if every lawmaker had taken part.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has worked hard not to commit his party to a distinct course on Brexit. But under pressure from many of his members, he has expressed a willingness to back a second referendum under certain circumstances.
But a referendum could take many forms, and there is no agreement on that, either.
One of the options Parliament considered this week was a popular vote to confirm or reject Mrs. May’s deal, and it lost, 295 to 268. Once again, more than enough lawmakers abstained to sway the outcome.
Many Brexit opponents want a different referendum, a rerun of the 2016 contest, asking voters if they want any Brexit at all. Polls indicate that public opinion has shifted in favor of remaining in the European Union, but so far, Parliament has not considered such a measure.
Still other pro-Europe voters want Parliament to kill Brexit on its own, or at least delay it for years, by revoking Article 50.
Exiting without a deal in place also remains a real possibility, one that the hard-line pro-Brexit forces in the Conservative Party insist would be preferable to a long delay.
What comes next?
Mrs. May’s third defeat appears to leave the increasingly weakened prime minister with two unpalatable options in the short run: Britain can leave the bloc on April 12 without an agreement in place, or she can ask European leaders for what could be a long postponement.
The only thing a parliamentary majority has been able to agree on is that it does not want to crash out of the European Union without a deal. But a long delay would enrage pro-Brexit lawmakers who see a further postponement as a first step toward watering down Brexit, or even killing it entirely.
No one knows how things will turn out. Some ardent Brexiteers, who would accept a no-deal withdrawal, have come around to supporting Mrs. May’s deal, believing that it might be their only chance to avoid a soft Brexit or remaining in the bloc, and others might follow.
The hard-liners fear that if nothing is approved by the new April deadline, the government would agree to a much longer extension to avoid a no-deal exit — which could give backers of a second referendum time to build support for what currently seems a long-shot option. That could end in Britons reversing their decision to leave the European Union altogether.
One thing is certain: It is a mess.

Parliament is set to debate the prime minister’s proposed next steps as well as alternative plans put forward by other lawmakers.CreditCreditDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesBy Benjamin MuellerJan. 28, 2019LONDON — On Tuesday, the British Parliament is to vote on a number of amendments to a motion outlining Prime Minister Theresa May’s Plan B for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. The casual observer will find this an opaque and arcane process, and can be forgiven for wondering why it took so long for lawmakers to start discussing different ideas.Here is a guide to the amendment process, and why it could be a critical moment for Brexit.Who Gets to Offer Amendments?At the beginning, at least, the amendment process is similar to that in the United States Congress. Bills are brought before the legislative body — by the government in Britain, by majority parties in the United States — and various lawmakers have the right to offer amendments.What Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.They provide a chance for lawmakers outside Mrs. May’s government — those in opposition parties, like Labour, and “backbenchers” in her own Conservative Party — to include their two cents. In this case, Mrs. May published a motion that Parliament will vote on Jan. 29; the motion may or may not have been amended in ways that can have a large impact on the final shape of Brexit.The amendments are not legally binding, for the most part, but Mrs. May will be under political pressure to follow any proposals that win the backing of a majority of lawmakers.So far, over a dozen amendments have been proposed.ImageJohn Bercow, the speaker of the British House of Commons, decides which amendments will get a vote.CreditJessica Taylor/UK Parliament, via Associated PressThat Sounds MessyThere is one important check on the process. While any lawmaker can offer an amendment, only one person in Parliament has the power to decide which of them get a vote: the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.Behind his famous braying of “Order, order!” and his insults of unnecessarily chatty lawmakers, the humdrum process of picking amendments is a big part of Mr. Bercow’s influence. To Mrs. May’s chagrin, he has been a champion of Parliament’s right to intervene.Until the vote on Tuesday, it will not be clear which amendments Mr. Bercow will allow.Even after he chooses, the lawmakers who wrote the amendments can pull them back at the last minute if they think they are not likely to pass. And Mrs. May can simply agree to take the changes if they look certain to win a majority.What Do They Say?The most hyped amendment, offered by Yvette Cooper of the Labour Party and the Conservative Nick Boles, is designed to make it more difficult for Britain to leave the bloc without a deal. If Parliament has not agreed to a deal by the end of February, the amendment says, Parliament should get a chance to vote on delaying Brexit, possibly for a few months or even until the end of the year.That would cheer a broad coalition of lawmakers who are aghast at the likely economic fallout of a no-deal exit, along with those who want to buy time for a second public vote on whether Brexit should happen at all.An amendment offered by a Conservative lawmaker, Graham Brady, would give Parliament’s backing to a harder-line Brexit. It is designed to force Mrs. May to scrap the “backstop” plan that at least temporarily binds Britain and, to a greater extent, Northern Ireland to European trading rules. (That plan is meant to avoid customs checks on the historically contentious border between Ireland, a member state of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.)What those warring amendments have in common is that they give clear signals about what Parliament does not want — a no-deal exit, in one case, or temporary ties to the European Union, in the other — without charting a course for what Mrs. May should negotiate instead.And there are many more. An amendment offered by a Conservative lawmaker, Dominic Grieve, would set aside six days before March 29, the Brexit deadline, for Parliament to debate a wide array of Brexit plans. Labour’s official amendment would let Parliament weigh in on the party’s preferred Brexit deal, which includes stronger and more lasting ties to the European Union’s single market, and says lawmakers should get to vote on whether to hold a second public vote on Brexit.ImagePrime Minister Theresa May will be under political pressure to follow any proposals that win the backing of a majority of lawmakers.CreditMark Duffy/UK Parliament, via ReutersWhat Does This Mean for Brexit?Mrs. May’s Conservative Party is split on the question of how thoroughly Britain should cut ties with the European Union. Labour is divided about whether Brexit should even happen.That has left Parliament in paralysis and Mrs. May unable to force through her Plan B. That logjam has put lawmakers in the rare position of being able to use amendments to rally unconventional, cross-party coalitions behind their own ideas.So it is possible, though by no means likely, that some new approach will emerge from all the competing proposals that enough factions can agree upon to get a Brexit deal over the finish line in Parliament. But at least one big question remains: If Parliament decides to send Mrs. May back to Brussels to tear up a deal that was the product of 18 months of negotiations and try to extract major concessions from the European Union, how will European leaders respond?So far, they have rejected any suggestion for changing the backstop unless Mrs. May eases her “red lines” on Brexit, particularly her refusal to have Britain remain in a customs union with the bloc. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, reiterated that stance in a recent phone call with the prime minister.At the very least, however, by Tuesday night Parliament should have a better idea of the support for some of the plans, whether hard, soft or, in the case of Mrs. May’s Plan B, somewhere in between.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: A Complicated Process May Alter Britain’s Fate.

The hearing was held in private.Outside the court in Edinburgh on Thursday, Mr. Salmond said to reporters: “I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality, and I’ll defend myself to the utmost in court.”Police Scotland began investigating Mr. Salmond, 64, after the Scottish government looked into complaints by two women who said he had sexually harassed them several years ago, an accusation he denies. The outcome of the government’s inquiry was not made public.Mr. Salmond was charged this week with two counts of attempted rape, nine counts of sexual assault, two counts of indecent assault and one count of breach of the peace. Prosecutors declined to give any details about the accusations that led to the charges.He has previously challenged the Scottish government’s process for investigating the complaints against him.“I have made many mistakes in my life, political and personal, but I have not sexually harassed anyone and I certainly have not been engaged in criminality,” he said in a BBC interview last year.Mr. Salmond won a legal victory in his dispute with the Scottish government over its investigation. The government admitted that it had violated its guidelines in assigning an investigating officer to the case who had previously been involved in the complaints process.A government lawyer said the investigating officer had some contact with the complainants before being assigned to the case, which could have created an appearance of potential bias. But the legal dispute did not lead to any public findings about the substance of the accusations.Mr. Salmond resigned as first minister and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party in 2014, after a referendum in which a majority of Scottish voters rejected proposals for independence from Britain.But he has remained vocal about the possibility of a second independence referendum, urging his successor and onetime protégée, Nicola Sturgeon, to call for another vote. The two, who were once allies, have fallen out over the sexual harassment investigation.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Leader Of Scotland Is Arrested.

By Penn BullockJan. 28, 2019(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Britain’s Parliament is set to hash out Brexit, the U.S. and the Taliban agree in principle to a peace framework, and France is debating the conduct of its police officers. Here’s the latest: ImagePro- and anti-Brexit protesters mingled outside Parliament in London on Monday.CreditHannah McKay/ReutersBritain prepares for more crucial Brexit votesThe British Parliament is expected to vote today on a number of amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan that could end up shaping how the country departs from the E.U.How it works: Various lawmakers, including those in opposition parties, have proposed more than a dozen changes to the wording of Mrs. May’s exit plan. Only the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, can decide which will be voted on. The voting is for the most part not binding, but Mrs. May will be under political pressure to adopt popular measures.What are the amendments? There is a broad range. The most hyped could delay Britain’s departure from the bloc for a few months or even until the end of the year if there is no deal. That would blunt Mrs. May’s best cudgel: the clock. What does it all mean? At the very least, the competing proposals should give Parliament a better idea of the kind of Brexit that would get wide support and perhaps even work.Tesco: Contending with competition from discount retailers and bracing for a possible Brexit shock, the largest grocer in Britain by market share said it was planning to cut thousands of jobs.ImageAmerican soldiers looking for improvised explosive devices in Tieranon, Afghanistan, in 2013.CreditBryan Denton for The New York TimesThe U.S. and Taliban agree to a potential peace frameworkOfficials from both parties agreed in principle to the outlines of a preliminary peace deal, the chief U.S. negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, told our reporter in Kabul. The agreement is the biggest step yet toward ending the 17-year Afghan conflict.Terms: U.S. negotiators said the deal would include a Taliban guarantee that Afghan territory would not be used for terrorist activity. The withdrawal of American troops would be contingent on larger concessions from the Taliban, including a cease-fire and direct talks with the Afghan government — concessions the insurgent group has rejected in the past.Behind the scenes: President Trump is eager to leave Afghanistan, but Defense Department officials, convinced he does not grasp the complexities of the war, are warning that a full withdrawal could lead to a terrorist attack on the U.S. within two years. And Afghan officials are increasingly suspicious that Mr. Trump will make a deal with the Taliban behind their backs. ImageJérôme Rodrigues, one of the leaders of the Yellow Vest movement, after being wounded in the eye during clashes with riot police officers in Paris on Saturday.CreditZakaria Abdelkafi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEyes and hands are lost as France cracks down on protestersDismay and rage are rising in France about the police response to months of protests by the Yellow Vest movement. Protesters’ grievous wounds have been making headlines for weeks, and critics say the government has become downright repressive.Developments: On Saturday, Jérôme Rodrigues, a well-known figure in the Yellow Vests, suffered an eye injury, apparently from a rubber projectile and a so-called dispersal grenade, as he was streaming live video on Facebook of a protest in Paris. “He will be handicapped for life,” his lawyer said. Context: Yellow Vest protests have mixed peaceful demonstration with violent looting, fire-setting and attacks on the police. But in Western Europe, only France, Northern Ireland and Spain use projectile guns loaded with rubber balls that can seriously maim. President Emmanuel Macron’s government has ignored calls to stop using them, arguing that the police response is justified by the level of chaos. In numbers: Since the revolt began in November, 11 people have died and 1,200 law enforcement officers have been injured. Among protesters there have been 1,900 injuries, 109 of them serious — including 18 who were blinded in one eye and four who lost a hand. An internal police group has opened 101 inquiries into use of force. ImageRight, a fake abortion clinic run by an abortion opponent in Dublin, with a real women’s health center next door.CreditMary Turner for The New York TimesBacklash builds against abortion rights in IrelandIn May, Ireland voted decisively in a historic referendum to end one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans and instead allow unrestricted abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy. But women seeking abortions still face major roadblocks in the strongly Catholic country.Newly emboldened anti-abortion activists have been massing outside clinics and even creating fake ones, emulating a tactic used by American activists in which women are lured inside and harangued about their choice. Doctors and hospitals worried about the stigma have been slow signing up to provide abortion services.Looking ahead: Abortion rights groups fear they can already see the sprouts of a sustained movement to overturn legal abortion, including the establishment this month of an anti-abortion party.Here’s what else is happeningRussia investigation: In a highly unusual statement, Matthew Whitaker, the acting U.S. attorney general, said that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was nearing the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow.

Pope Francis: The pope tried to tamp down expectations for a global meeting at the Vatican next month on child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, saying it was mainly intended to educate bishops and other church leaders. Huawei: The U.S. Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against the Chinese telecom firm Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, outlining a decade-long attempt by the company to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran. The U.S. also said it would seek to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at its request.Venezuela: The Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, cutting off the main source of cash for the government of the embattled president, Nicolás Maduro. Carlos Ghosn: American securities regulators are now also scrutinizing Nissan Motor, whose former chairman is accused by the Japanese authorities of financial misconduct.

Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, has been charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He was arrested in a pre-dawn F.B.I. raid in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and appeared in court on Friday.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesBy Mark Mazzetti, Eileen Sullivan and Maggie HabermanJan. 25, 2019WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians.A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment. The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscow’s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race.The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts — even a reference to “The Godfather: Part II” — Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. Mr. Mueller did not say that Mr. Stone’s interactions with WikiLeaks were illegal, nor that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.[Read the indictment.]F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn. Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest. Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents.How Stone is Connected to WikiLeaks and President Trump

By The New York TimesF.B.I. agents were also seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stone’s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided.Mr. Stone appeared briefly on Friday morning in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, his ankles and waist shackled in front of a packed courtroom. A man known for his dapper wardrobe was dressed simply in a navy blue cotton polo shirt, bluejeans and his trademark round, black-rimmed glasses.[Read more about Roger Stone, a self-described dirty trickster.]Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges. “There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,” he said.“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon. In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges.[Transcript: Read Mr. Stone’s statement responding to his arrest.] The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trump’s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them.According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks’ possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton. On July 22 that year, WikiLeaks released its first batch of Democratic emails. After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.ImageA portion of the indictment.“A senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,” the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges. “The charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president,” she told CNN. Asked whether he directed a campaign aide to contact Mr. Stone about the WikiLeaks emails, she repeated that the charges did not involve Mr. Trump.A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back. He has spent decades plying the political dark arts — including scandal-mongering — to help influence American election campaigns, and has long maintained that he had no connection to Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow’s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid. His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump — like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime.The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operatives’ plans before they hacked the Democrats.In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said he has been falsely accused and “will plead not guilty.” He also called the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, “politically motivated.”CreditCreditCristobal Herrera/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking. Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks.Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Mueller’s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks’ actions, but also that he took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy.In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trump’s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Stone wrote that more WikiLeaks disclosures were forthcoming, “a load every week going forward,” according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon appears to be the official described in the court document as “the high-ranking Trump Campaign official,” based on previous disclosures about the email exchange.Tuesday, October 4, 2016FROM: Steve Bannon TO: Roger StoneEMAIL: What was that this morning???Tuesday, October 4, 2016 FROM: Roger StoneTO: Steve BannonEMAIL: Fear.

Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign.The special counsel’s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks’ document releases in the months before the election.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment documented numerous lies to lawmakers about his efforts to set up a back channel to WikiLeaks, and about his efforts to pressure other witnesses to lie.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: The Story of Roger Stone and WikiLeaksThe special counsel’s indictment of the longtime Trump adviser establishes a direct connection between WikiLeaks and the president’s campaign.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/24:25-24:25transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: The Story of Roger Stone and WikiLeaksHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Theo Balcomb, Paige Cowett, Jonathan Wolfe and Alexandra Leigh Young, and edited by Lisa TobinThe special counsel’s indictment of the longtime Trump adviser establishes a direct connection between WikiLeaks and the president’s campaign.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro.

Roger Stone is a trickster. Roger Stone is a shady character, O.K.? I know Roger Stone, and you know, he worked for Nixon. He famously tattooed his hero on his back. And who among us can say that? The questionable consultant’s resume is filled with work for Republican stars — Nixon, Reagan, Bush senior.mark mazzettiHe is someone who very proudly talks about how he tries to plant stories with the press, someone who tries to dig up any kind of personal dirt about a candidate in order to help the other side.archived recording (roger stone)I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against bull-bull-[BLEEP]-ing-ing and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. I’m sure it’s driving the Democrats crazy, but there’s nothing illegal about it.mark mazzettiSo this is someone who — well, for many people who hate politics, they would hate someone like Roger Stone.archived recording (roger stone)The truth is, Jimmy Carter’s middle name was not Hussein. A very substantial number of people wonder, because of the policies of this administration, about whether the president is a Muslim. This is not going to hurt Trump, and it’s not going to hurt Carson.archived recordingThey may wonder, but should a presidential candidate like Trump be saying that, or at least condoning it with his silence?archived recording (roger stone)I don’t think he commented either way.mark mazzettiHe goes on television in strange outfits, he gives interviews from his pool and clearly, in many cases, doesn’t take himself too seriously.michael barbaroSo he’s kind of a sideshow.mark mazzettiExcept he’s someone who Donald Trump has taken seriously for a long time.archived recording (roger stone)He’s a regular guy. You can talk to him like a regular person. There’s nothing formal or stilted about him, and he’s funny. He’s got a great self-deprecating wit. He’s just fun to be with.mark mazzettiHe’s been this sort of informal adviser to Trump over decades, and someone who, long, long before anyone took seriously the idea of Donald Trump being the president of the United States, Roger Stone was pushing this idea.archived recording (roger stone)It was not until 1987, really, late ‘87, that I began thinking about him as a presidential candidate.mark mazzettiAlthough it has often been a contentious relationship.archived recording (roger stone)Yeah, I think we have a complicated relationship. But first of all, recognize, I’m a Trump loyalist. Even when he’s wrong, I’ll be there.mark mazzettiThey’ve been at odds at times. He’s someone who didn’t last very long on the Trump campaign. He started out as an official campaign adviser, but was fired from the campaign pretty quickly.archived recordingAnd more turmoil for Trump — a top longtime associate both from his business world and in the political realm, Roger Stone is out tonight. Dispute about whether he resigned or was fired. Trump’s campaign says Stone was fired because he was using the campaign to seek publicity for himself.archived recording (roger stone)I have no interest in going back. Although I strongly support Trump, we have managerial differences. And meanwhile, I’m just making the very best case for him in public that I can, because I do think he has what it takes.michael barbaroAnd insofar as he was involved in the campaign, what exactly was his role as an informal adviser? What did that amount to?mark mazzettiHe was the classic late-night phone call person to listen to what Trump was thinking. He was the confidant of then-candidate Trump, talking to him by phone, being a sort of back channel of advice outside official campaign communications. You didn’t always know that Roger Stone was there, because he did have this behind-the-scenes role. But it was pretty apparent to people close to Trump that Roger Stone had this outsized influence over Trump.archived recordingIt seems to me there’s more than meets the eye here with Roger Stone parting company from the Trump campaign, coming on my program and others and giving the big Trump pitch.archived recording (roger stone)You media types are so conspiratorial. [LAUGHTER]archived recordingNo, no, the Stone-Trump types I think are the conspiratorial.archived recording (roger stone)I’m like —mark mazzettiSo he was behind the scenes until he wasn’t. In August of 2016, a few months before the election, Roger Stone sent a very cryptic tweet about Podesta.archived recordingRoger Stone tweeted that it would soon be, quote, “Podesta’s time in the barrel.”mark mazzettiAnd he said it will soon be his time in the barrel. Now Podesta was John Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And no one really knew what that meant until a few months later in October. A few weeks before the election, he sent out another tweet. I think it said, “On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton is done. #WikiLeaks.”archived recordingRoger Stone writes, “Thursday, October 6, Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing. I stand by my prediction. #HandcuffsForHillary.”mark mazzettiAnd then —archived recordingWe need to talk about these hacked emails.mark mazzettiThe Podesta emails spill out a few days later.archived recordingWikiLeaks released more than 2,000 emails. They claim they came from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, and other staffers. The leak revealed transcripts from some of Clinton’s paid Wall Street speeches. This is the first time that we’re actually getting a look at these Wall Street speeches. What you see is that her own words really hit on her own perceived weaknesses, particularly around relatability and trust. You see why she really wasn’t in a hurry to release these, as it really highlights a lot of concerns that voters have about her.mark mazzettiAnd so this is again Roger Stone creating this image that he had a direct channel to WikiLeaks and knew what the information was going to be before it became public.michael barbaroRight. And if I remember correctly, one of those WikiLeaks dumps of emails was right around the time of the “Access Hollywood” tape being published.archived recording (john podesta)October 7, the “Access Hollywood” tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails into the public. One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.michael barbaroWhich was interesting timing.mark mazzettiWithin hours. And of course, that’s very fortuitous timing if you’re candidate Trump. Very quickly, a lot of the media started focusing on the Podesta emails rather than this explosive story about the “Access Hollywood” tape.michael barbaroSo at this point, justifiably, everyone is starting to wonder, does Roger Stone, this informal adviser to the president who is in touch with the campaign, does he have inside knowledge of what’s going on at WikiLeaks? Is he coordinating with this organization?mark mazzettiYes, and remember, Roger Stone has built a career on creating an image that he does have great access.archived recording (roger stone)I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation.mark mazzettiHe does have insight that others don’t.archived recording (roger stone)I think that Assange is going to be very influential in this election, because he’s going to be educating the American people about the Clintons.mark mazzettiOnce the Russia investigation heats up, though, he has to reverse course.archived recording (roger stone)I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure time of the WikiLeaks disclosures. Assange himself has said so. In fact, Assange has said in his own tweets and in interviews that Roger Stone never predicted anything that I hadn’t already said in public.mark mazzettiHe has to paint himself as someone who didn’t have that knowledge, who didn’t have any insight, because that was something that could potentially put him in real legal jeopardy.michael barbaroSo what do we learn from this indictment last week about what was really going on here?mark mazzettiSo what we learned on Friday is that Roger Stone in fact did have insights into what WikiLeaks was doing. He made extensive efforts to find out what Julian Assange was planning. And we find out that he was directed by people inside the campaign to go find out what WikiLeaks was doing. So we really, for the first time, have a sense that there was a link between WikiLeaks’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton. And that link was Roger Stone. And something else that should not be lost in all this is that all of this was happening months after it was first revealed that the Russian government was behind this operation to hack the Democratic servers and put the information out for WikiLeaks.michael barbaroAnd that’s significant because it’s one thing to be coordinating with WikiLeaks when no one quite knows how it got those internal Clinton emails. It’s another to be coordinating with WikiLeaks once it’s understood that the emails it’s disseminating were stolen by Russia. It seems to elevate this above wanting negative information about your opponent out in the world.mark mazzettiThat’s right. All of this was done while it was well known that the Russians were behind this operation.michael barbaroSo do we know who on the campaign was talking to Roger Stone and encouraging him to keep communicating with WikiLeaks and find out when their leaks would occur?mark mazzettiThat’s where it becomes really interesting. The Times reported a few months ago that Steve Bannon, who was the campaign chairman at the end, was in contact with Roger Stone about this. In early October, Stone writes Steve Bannon that WikiLeaks would release, quote, “a load every week going forward.” He separately writes to a supporter involved in the Trump campaign, quote, “spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.”michael barbaroFriend in London presumably meaning Julian Assange?mark mazzettiRight. But the Mueller indictment has a very tantalizing detail.michael barbaroWhat’s that?mark mazzettiThe indictment said that a senior campaign official, quote, was directed by someone to contact Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases. There’s a very odd use of the passive voice that you would not expect in an indictment written by lawyers with Ivy League educations. The indictment does not say who it was that directed the senior campaign official. Of course, it’s led to speculation that that person could only be Donald Trump. We don’t know.michael barbaroEverything you’re describing here about Roger Stone’s communications with the campaign and Roger Stone’s communications with WikiLeaks — it sounds quite nefarious, but I wonder if it is illegal. Is his communication with WikiLeaks what Roger Stone was indicted for?mark mazzettiNo. The charge is Stone lying to Congress about his interactions with WikiLeaks, trying to tamper with witness testimony and an overall charge of obstruction of justice. As for the witness tampering charge, that centers around Stone’s interactions with someone named Randy Credico, who is a longtime New York radio personality, on-again-off-again friend of Stone, and someone who did in fact seem to have direct connections to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. And what the indictment details is that Roger Stone had several communications with Credico, trying to make sure that Credico told the same story to the House that Roger Stone had told, and even suggesting that he should pull a, quote, “Frank Pentangeli” before the committee.archived recordingDid you serve on the capital regime, Peter Clemenza, under Vito Corleone, also known as “the godfather“?mark mazzettiAnd that is a reference to a character in “The Godfather 2” who is called before Congress to testify about the mob and all of a sudden gets amnesia.archived recordingI ask you again, sir, here and now, under oath, were you at any time a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone? I don’t know nothing about that! Oh. I was in the olive oil business with his father, but that was a long time ago. That’s all.michael barbaroAnd why isn’t Mueller going after Stone for anything other than the lying, for the actions he lied about?mark mazzettiIt’s hard to make a conspiracy case. The fact is that the emails appear to have been stolen before Roger Stone knew about them, so he didn’t seem to have participated in the theft. And he seemed to maybe be trafficking in information that was becoming public or was about to be public. And this is what his defenders and the president’s defenders have pointed out, that these are all crimes that happened after the fact. He is not being charged with something that’s at the bottom of this whole thing — collusion, conspiracy, et cetera. And this is what, of course, President Trump has fallen back on for some time.archived recordingThis is why this thing is so weird, strange. The crime is conspiracy to hack. Collusion is not a crime. It doesn’t exist. Now, conspiracy to defraud the government — you’re right. Conspiracy to hack, that is the crime. We don’t know whether — Now, did Donald Trump engage in a conspiracy to hack with the Russians? They’ve been going at it — the counterintelligence investigation came to the conclusion — no evidence.michael barbaroMark, it feels like time and time again, when it comes to the Mueller investigation, he and his prosecutors are charging people around the president with lying or tampering with a witness or doing something deceptive around their interactions with his own investigation, but not with actually colluding with Russia or coordinating with Russia or being involved in a conspiracy that involves Russia, which, of course, is what this investigation is really about. What do you make of that?mark mazzettiIf you want to look at it as a best-case scenario for President Trump, it’s that there’s no original crime here. There’s no collusion, there’s no conspiracy. They’ve been charged because they were just lying to Congress.archived recordingToday’s surprise guilty plea by Michael Cohen — Cohen said in federal court that he lied to Congress, he says, to support Mr. Trump’s timeline of a Moscow real estate deal.mark mazzettiLying to the F.B.I. Withholding evidence.archived recordingTonight, former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos admitting he lied to the F.B.I. about his contacts with someone the F.B.I. suspected of being a Russian operative to cover for President Trump.mark mazzettiBut the worst-case scenario is that they are lying to protect something big. They were so concerned about what’s at the bottom of this story that they had to lie to keep investigators from getting there. That’s been one of the enduring mysteries of this entire story. Was there a grand conspiracy, or does this all add up to small, individual acts, individual contacts with Russians, individual business deals gone bad that individual people were trying to lie to cover up their own role? The fact that we don’t know where Mueller is going and Mueller only reveals his strategy in individual indictments means that we’re still left with these kinds of questions.michael barbaroAnd in this latest indictment, we’ve learned that Roger Stone, who has not been taken very seriously all this time, now seems to represent something quite important in all of this.mark mazzettiYes. In many ways, Roger Stone was this kind of cartoonish figure. If this were a whodunit, he’d be the obvious suspect that a reader would have long ago dismissed because he’s too obvious. And yet, here’s Roger Stone being charged with very serious crimes. And for the first time, we see Mueller show his hand that there really was this direct link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. But I think the bigger point is the question of how directly the Trump campaign officials were working with the original source of the information, and that is the Russian government. WikiLeaks was a pass-through here. The Russian government, Russian hackers gave it to WikiLeaks to distribute. The real question at the end of the day is not the communications necessarily with WikiLeaks, but whether there was foreknowledge about what Russia was doing and any direct communication with the Russians about their campaign to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s political future.michael barbaroMark, thank you very much.mark mazzettiThank you.michael barbaroWe’ll be right back.archived recording (president trump)Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government. [APPLAUSE]michael barbaroOn Friday afternoon, just hours after the F.B.I. raid of Roger Stone’s home, President Trump walked into the Rose Garden of the White House and announced victoriously that he was temporarily ending the shutdown with no agreement from the Democrats to fund his border wall.archived recording (president trump)I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers and their amazing families —michael barbaroThe announcement came a day after two bills to reopen the government — one sponsored by Republicans, the other by Democrats — failed to pass in the Senate, and as frustration over the shutdown began to boil over in highly public and disruptive ways.archived recordingThey’re both clowns. Both sides should sit down and make it happen, including our president, including Pelosi. It’s ridiculous. It’s not fair. It’s not T.S.A.‘s fault that they’re not getting paid and stuff. It’s the government’s fault. So the government should get it together.michael barbaroBy Friday, so many air traffic controllers had called in sick that the Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights across the Northeast. Hundreds of workers at the IRS refused to show up for work, and the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, had released a public message to his employees.archived recording (christopher wray)Hi, everyone. We’re now five weeks and two missed paychecks into this mess, and I wanted to touch base with all of you again. Making some people stay home when they don’t want to and making others show up without pay — it’s mind-boggling, it’s short-sighted and it’s unfair. It takes a lot to get me angry, but I’m about as angry as I’ve been in a long, long time.michael barbaroUnity among congressional Republicans, which had held for a month, began to collapse, with Republican senators, including majority leader Mitch McConnell, telling Vice President Mike Pence that the president’s shutdown strategy was not working and needed to end immediately. In his speech, the president, who has made the $5.7 billion in funding for his wall a non-negotiable condition for ending the shutdown, and who repeatedly rejected Democratic proposals to reopen the government while negotiations continue, ultimately did just that, restoring government to normal function for the next three weeks and promising to quickly pay back federal workers who have missed paychecks since the shutdown began. But —archived recording (president trump)If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.michael barbaroDemocrats and Republicans will enter formal negotiations this week to see if they can find a compromise on border security funding and on what constitutes a wall, a definition that is evolving for the president himself.archived recording (president trump)We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea. We never did. We never proposed that. We never wanted that, because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They’re already there. They’ve been there for millions of years.michael barbaroThat change in language and the decision to reopen the government with no funding for the wall drew condemnation from conservatives like Ann Coulter, who many believe helped push the president into a shutdown in the first place. “Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush,” Coulter wrote on Twitter. “As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp to ever serve as president of the United States.” That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone’s.Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a “Godfather” character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign. Within months, however, the two had a public dispute and Mr. Stone left the team. But they have remained close, speaking often by telephone.On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend’s house in the morning darkness.“Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!” he wrote on Twitter. “NO COLLUSION!”Charlie Savage and Michael S.

But there are several difficulties with the current briefs for impeachment, which suffice for now to keep a Pence presidency out of reach.The first is the gulf between the democracy-subverting powers that the briefs ascribe to Trump and the actual extent of his influence. In Appelbaum’s essay, the president is charged with nothing less than having “trampled” on “the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.” But many of his examples feature Trump failing to actually trample anything. He “did his best” to enact a Muslim travel ban (the actual ban was limited and upheld by the Supreme Court), he has “called for” the firing of political enemies (with little discernible result), he has made “efforts” to impede the Mueller investigation (which continues apace), and so on down the list of outrages that exist primarily on his Twitter feed.Much of the case for “trampling,” then, is a case against Trump’s rhetoric. And one can acknowledge that rhetoric’s evils while doubting that the ranting of a president so hemmed in, unpopular and weak is meaningfully threatening the Constitution.Especially because of the second problem with the case for impeachment, which might be summed up in a line from a poem that Trump often quoted in 2016: You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. Meaning, in this case, that little about his rhetorical excess, his penchant for lies and insults or the seaminess of his courtiers was hidden from voters on the campaign trail in 2016, in an election that by the Constitution’s standards Trump legitimately won.The electorate’s foreknowledge of a politician’s sleaziness doesn't preclude impeachment. But it means that there is, at least, a quantum of sleaze that the president's supporters voted to accept. And the closer we get to a new election — including another primary campaign — the stronger the case for asking voters to retract that endorsement, instead of pre-empting their judgment from on high.The rebuttal here is that the danger of keeping Trump in office is too great — a point with which I sympathize, because I fear Trump’s incapacity in an unlooked-for crisis. But I’m more doubtful about the policy dangers that are supposedly evident right now.Appelbaum, for instance, analogizes Trump’s race-baiting to Andrew Johnson’s efforts to impede Reconstruction in the late-1860s South. But when he was impeached, Johnson was literally using his veto to abet the possible restoration of white supremacy. Whereas Trump is conspicuously losing a fight over some modest border fencing, and his last race-inflected policy move was … a criminal justice reform supported by many African-Americans. The president may be a bigot, but the policy stakes do not remotely resemble 1868.Then there are the geopolitical risks of Trump’s alleged Russian loyalties. After the Stone arrest, Appelbaum’s Atlantic colleague David Frum deemed these too severe to wait even for Robert Mueller’s verdict: “But now — now! — the country is in danger.”But in the absence of Mueller-stamped evidence, what we have to prove that peril is Trump’s actual foreign policy, which is erratic but frequently quite unfriendly to Moscow — with the administration’s effort to subvert the Russian-aligned Maduro regime in Venezuela just this week’s example.Which makes it entirely reasonable to wait to see whether Mueller vindicates the various uncorroborated scoops about a conspiracy hatched in Prague or the Ecuadorean Embassy, rather than trying to impeach Trump for, say, his private griping about NATO.At the end of my invoke-the-25th-Amendment column I wrote, “There will be time to return again to world-weariness and cynicism as this agony drags on.” That was month four of this presidency; as we approach month 25 I suppose I have become that world-weary cynic.But like all cynics I prefer to call it realism. If you want Trump gone, the existing case for impeachment will not do it. You must either prove him — not Stone or some other hanger-on, but him — guilty of conspiracy, or accept that he will depart only when he is beaten at the polls.RelatedOpinion | David LeonhardtThe People vs. Donald J.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSunday ReviewSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperSunday Review|Stone-Cold LoserAdvertisementOpinionSupported byStone-Cold LoserBy Maureen DowdOpinion ColumnistJan. 26, 2019ImageRoger Stone posed for a portrait in his Upper East Side apartment in 2015.CreditCreditJesse Dittmar for The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Roger Stone has always lived in a dog-eat-dog world.So it was apt that he was charged with skulduggery in part for threatening to kidnap a therapy dog, a fluffy, sweet-faced Coton de Tuléar, belonging to Randy Credico, a New York radio host.Robert Mueller believes that Credico, a pal of Julian Assange, served as an intermediary with WikiLeaks for Stone. Mueller’s indictment charges that Stone called Credico “a rat” and “a stoolie” because he believed that the radio host was not going to back up what the special counsel says is Stone’s false story about contacts with WikiLeaks, which disseminated Russia’s hacked emails from the D.N.C. and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.Stone emailed Credico that he would “take that dog away from you,” the indictment says, later adding: “I am so ready. Let’s get it on. Prepare to die (expletive).”As the owner of two Yorkies, Stone clearly knows how scary it is when a beloved dog is in harm’s way. When he emerged from court on Friday, he immediately complained that F.B.I. agents had “terrorized” his dogs when they came to arrest him at dawn at his home in Fort Lauderdale.The last thing Stone posted on Instagram before his arrest was a video of a terrier, with a high-pitched voice-over, protesting, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong.”Always bespoke and natty, living by the mantra that it’s better to be infamous than never famous, Stone looked strangely unadorned as he came out of court to meet the press in a navy polo shirt and bluejeans.As the master of darkness who had been captured in darkness stepped into the bright light of Fort Lauderdale, he was his usual flamboyant, unapologetically meretricious self. He proclaimed his innocence, flashed the Nixon victory sign and reiterated the old saw from his mentor, Roy Cohn, that any attention is good attention.But it fell flat. Being Roger Stone had finally caught up with him.ImageMr. Stone after an appearance in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Friday.CreditJoe Skipper/ReutersHe has always said Florida suited him because “it was a sunny place for shady people,” borrowing a Somerset Maugham line. But now the cat’s cradle of lies and dirty tricks had tripped up the putative dognapper. And it went down on the very same day that Paul Manafort — his former associate in a seamy lobbying firm with rancid dictators as clients, and then later his pal in the seamy campaign of Donald Trump — was also in federal court on charges related to the Mueller probe. Manafort’s hair is now almost completely white.One of Stone’s rules — along with soaking his martini olives in vermouth and never wearing a double-breasted suit with a button-down collar — is “Deny, deny, deny.” But his arrest for lying, obstructing and witness tampering raised the inevitable question about his on-and-off friend in the White House, the man who is the last jigsaw-puzzle piece in the investigation of Trumpworld’s alleged coordination with Russia: Is being Donald Trump finally about to catch up with Donald Trump?Stone, who famously has Nixon’s face tattooed on his back, is the agent provocateur who is the through line from the Nixon impeachment articles to the articles about Trump’s possible impeachment.As Manafort said in the 2017 documentary “Get Me Roger Stone,” Trump and Stone “see the world in a very similar way.” And that way is theatrical and cynical. Do whatever you have to do to get what you want; playing by the rules is for suckers.In 1999, when I went on a trip to Miami to watch Trump test the presidential waters, Stone orchestrated Trump’s Castro-bashing speech to Cuban-Americans. The bodybuilding, swinging strategist, christened “the state-of-the-art sleazeball” by The New Republic in the 80s, said he was “a jockey looking for a horse.”Stone, who was mixed up in Watergate at the tender age of 19, “made the transition from the Stone Age of dirty tricks to today,” as David Axelrod puts it.He watched Nixon rally the silent majority with a law-and-order message and racial dog whistling. He helped Ronald Reagan create Reagan Democrats.For decades, believing “past is prologue,” Stone urged Trump to be the successor to those pols, revving up angry, white working-class voters who felt belittled or scared of “the other.” It would be so easy to divide and stoke resentment, as Stone and Trump proved when they inflamed the birther controversy against Barack Obama.“Hate is a stronger motivator than love,” Stone told the documentarians. “Human nature has never changed.”The tribal tensions in America made Stone’s favorite tricks easier than ever; he didn’t have to operate in the shadows. He wore a T-shirt with Bill Clinton and the word “Rape” at 2016 campaign rallies. As Stone boasted in the documentary, his “slash-and-burn” tactics “are now in vogue.”Trump has had periods of estrangement with Stone. In 2008, in an interview with The New Yorker, he called the strategist “a stone-cold loser,” a state Trump himself has been relegated to this past week, courtesy of Nancy Pelosi.Stone will not go gently. When he is asked about the tattoo of Nixon, he says he got it to remind himself, “A man is not finished when he is defeated; he is only finished when he quits.”At the moment, though, dogged by Mueller, Stone and Manafort are the dog’s breakfast. The pair has given practicing the dark arts a bad name.Correction: Jan. 27, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated the conclusion of impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon.

Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said on Sunday that he was “prepared to fight for my life” and prove his innocence in the case brought against him by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Stone, who was charged on Friday with obstruction of justice, witness tampering and making false statements, said on ABC’s “This Week” that text message exchanges that were cited in his indictment were being misrepresented.“It has to be seen in context,” Mr. Stone said of his exchanges with Randy Credico, a former associate and political gadfly. “It is a humorous exchange. They’re taking things out of context to present them in a light that mischaracterizes their significance. I never told Mr. Credico to lie.”Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico in 2017 to “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The reference was to a character in “The Godfather: Part II” who ultimately avoids implicating another person in his own testimony before Congress.“If you testify you’re a fool,” Mr. Stone said in one message, according to the indictment, adding that he could “never get away with” invoking his Fifth Amendment right but that Mr. Credico could. “I guarantee you you are the one who gets indicted for perjury if you’re stupid enough to testify.”Mr. Stone’s legal team has said that other text exchanges reveal that he and Mr. Credico often had jocular back and forths, before and after the ones in question, that undercut the notion that Mr. Credico could have felt threatened.Mr. Stone said he had forgotten about some exchanges with Mr. Credico when he told House investigators that they did not exist, a statement that was part of the indictment against him.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, has been charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He was arrested in a pre-dawn F.B.I. raid in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and appeared in court on Friday.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty Images“I did forget on some occasions that I had text messages and emails,” Mr. Stone said. “I am human and I did make some errors, but they’re errors that would be inconsequential in the scope of this investigation.”Mr. Stone also said that he never spoke with Mr. Trump about WikiLeaks, and that they did not discuss a pardon or the investigation into collusion with Russian officials.According to the indictment, a top official from the Trump campaign dispatched him to get information from the group about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails that were damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.In a tweet over the weekend, Mr. Trump appeared to put some distance between himself and Mr. Stone, saying that his adviser did not work for the campaign for most of 2016.On Sunday, Mr. Stone did not rule out the possibility of speaking with Mr. Mueller’s investigators.“If there’s wrongdoing by other people in the campaign that I know about, which I know of none, but if there is I would certainly testify honestly,” he said.“I’d also testify honestly about any other matter, including any communications with the president,” he continued. “It’s true that we spoke on the phone, but those communications are political in nature, they’re benign, and there is — there is certainly no conspiracy with Russia,” he said.Mr. Stone also acknowledged that it was unusual for a defendant who has been arrested to promptly go on a media tour. But Mr. Stone, who has never shied from attention, said he wanted to highlight what he called the “extraordinary” tactics and aggression that the F.B.I. used in its predawn raid on his Florida home.“I think the American people need to hear about it,” said Mr. Stone, who noted that he is 66, owns no firearms and has an expired passport.“I was not a flight risk,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Stone Says Text Messages Cited In Charges Were Misrepresented.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|House of Pain for President TrumpAdvertisementOpinionSupported byHouse of Pain for President TrumpThe new Democratic majority in Congress maps out its investigations of the Trump administration.By The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Jan. 30, 2019ImageCreditCreditAndrea D'AquinoWith the political madness of recent weeks — the shutdown and the smackdowns, the incitements and the indictments — it’s easy to forget there is much actual governing to be done by the new Congress: bills to introduce, nominees to consider and, for House Democrats in particular, oversight of the executive branch to conduct. Major oversight. Attempting to hold this administration to account will be among the new Democratic majority’s most vital, and most fraught, duties — especially after two years of cowed Republicans letting the president operate unchecked. A White House has perhaps never more vividly demonstrated the need for some countervailing force to check its corruption and incompetence, its disdain for the Constitution and its assault on democratic norms.But precisely because there are so many legitimate avenues of inquiry, Democrats must proceed with caution to avoid looking as though they’re piling on in a punitive or grossly partisan manner. While many Democrats and not a few anti-Trump Republicans would doubtless be delighted to see the president subjected to daily investigative torture, House Democrats cannot afford to alienate the independents and swing voters needed to send him packing in 2020. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that a plurality of independents already expect the new House majority to go overboard with its oversight, and even some Democratic lawmakers have expressed unease. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the new Budget Committee chairman, recently joked that Congress would “have to build an air traffic control tower to keep track of all the subpoenas flying from here to the White House.”Eager to fuel this perception, Team Trump has been smearing Democrats as engaged in a campaign of “presidential harassment.” It’s the president’s signature move: attack anyone or anything that displeases him — the news media, the courts, the electoral process, insufficiently obsequious Republicans, his own Department of Justice, science — to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of his base. Democrats insist they understand the risks. Conference leaders and key committee members have been preparing to take the oversight reins since the opening months of Mr. Trump’s tenure. They have held weekly strategy meetings to chart an investigative course focused less on the personal sins of the president than on the harm wrought by his administration’s atrocious policies and operational fecklessness.To avert an investigative free-for-all, Democrats decided early on that they needed to prioritize their inquiries within a basic narrative framework: How is misbehavior X endangering the health and safety of our democracy or of the American people?Issues ranking high on Democrats’ inquiry list include the administration’s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico; its decisions not to defend the pre-existing conditions provision of Obamacare and to undermine the program by starving it of funds; its policy of separating migrant families at the southern border; and its rollback of environmental protections.Other prime lines of inquiry are whether former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stood to benefit personally from decisions he made in office, whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross lied to Congress about his efforts to add a question about citizenship to the new census — and pretty much every decision made so far by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Such potential maladministration may not be as buzzy as, say, exploring whether Mr. Trump paid hush money to former mistresses or underpaid his taxes by a few hundred million dollars. But it does concretely influence the health and well-being of the public.This is not to say Mr. Trump will get a pass on his personal behavior, simply that Democrats will try to keep the focus on the bigger picture. For instance, Mr. Trump’s continued refusal to release his tax returns is part of his family’s sketchy financial dealings, which raise serious questions about everything from emoluments violations to inappropriate dealings with foreign interests. The crucial question isn’t whether the president has violated the law but whether he has been selling out the nation for personal gain.That said, Democrats say they plan to leave the Russia digging largely to Robert Mueller. They are aware that interfering with the special counsel’s investigation in any way could damage both their efforts and his.With a House Democratic caucus this big — and this fired up — it can be tough to keep members on message. But Democratic leaders have been working since early 2017 to put processes in place to maximize order and unity. The heads of committees coordinate their inquiries to present a united front and to avoid stepping on one another’s toes. Leadership has been aggressively pushing the message that the most effective way for rank-and-file members to pursue possible misdeeds by the administration is to work with senior members of the appropriate committees.Inevitably, individual members will go rogue now and again. Representative Al Green has signed onto the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer’s impeachment crusade, despite party leadership’s commitment to steer clear of the “I” word for now. And freshman Representative Rashida Tlaib’s vulgar call to impeach the president set off self-righteous outrage among Republicans and hand-wringing among some of her Democratic colleagues. Democrats are looking to stay disciplined enough with their oversight mission to convey a sense of order amid the chaos. Just this week, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, publicly praised the chairman, Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat, for ushering in “a new era of bipartisanship” with his restrained use of subpoenas and his commitment to “an unprecedented level of transparency.” Likewise, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, praised the pledge of the committee chairman, Elijah Cummings, to handle subpoenas in a collaborative manner.It’s a promising start.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: House of Pain for President Trump.

Mueller III, “politically motivated.”CreditCreditCristobal Herrera/EPA, via ShutterstockBy Eileen Sullivan and Sharon LaFraniereJan. 25, 2019阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版WASHINGTON — In Friday’s indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, the special counsel for the first time revealed evidence of efforts by senior Trump campaign officials to learn how emails and other information that had been hacked by Russia and given to WikiLeaks could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The evidence appeared to contradict Mr. Stone’s assertions that he was acting on his own in his attempts to communicate with WikiLeaks. Senior campaign officials asked Mr. Stone to look into WikiLeaks’ plans, and he kept the campaign abreast of what he found out, the indictment said.The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, disclosed new details about his investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign:The campaign sought to learn how WikiLeaks’ releases might damage Mrs. ClintonThe public has long known that Mr. Stone and his associates had tried to connect with WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. Senior campaign officials dispatched Mr. Stone on that mission, the indictment revealed.In June or July 2016, Mr. Stone told senior campaign aides that he knew that WikiLeaks had documents “whose release would be damaging to the Clinton campaign,” the indictment said. After WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee on July 22, 2016, “a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases” and other information that WikiLeaks had that could hurt Mr. Trump’s opponent in the race, Mrs. Clinton.The Trump campaign officials were interested in learning about the stolen emails and other documents, despite the fact, as the indictment noted, that the Democratic National Committee had publicly blamed the Russian government more than a month earlier for hacking its computers.Someone ‘directed’ a senior Trump campaign aide to contact Mr. StoneThis is the most tantalizing new detail in the indictment. Prosecutors left open the possibility that Mr. Trump himself might have wanted to find out how WikiLeaks could hurt Mrs. Clinton’s chances of winning the White House. The indictment provided no details about either the senior campaign official or the unnamed person.ImageA portion of the indictment.Everyone Who’s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel.Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, sought to distance his client from the indictment and any suggestion that he might have sought to coordinate with WikiLeaks. “The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else,” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. “Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress.”It was obvious during the summer of 2016 that Mr. Trump was interested in what WikiLeaks was up to. A day after WikiLeaks released the Democratic committee’s emails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the documents showed Democrats were trying to “destroy” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was running against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Trump directed his Twitter followers to the WikiLeaks disclosures, writing: “On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED.”And a few days later, during a campaign rally, Mr. Trump invited Russia to search for emails Mrs. Clinton had deleted from a private account when she was secretary of state.Mr. Stone is not charged with conspiracyCampaign officials sought information from WikiLeaks, the indictment said, but it did not allege that those interactions were illegal or that Mr. Stone or anyone else tied to the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.This is a point that lawyers for the White House and Mr. Stone emphasized in response to Mr. Stone’s arrest and the allegations in the indictment. The lawyers said Mr. Stone was not charged with “collusion” — the president’s shorthand for conspiring with the Russians.Mr. Mueller’s team has obtained indictments against Russians for conspiring to defraud the United States through an illegal social media campaign and conspiring to hack Democratic computers to steal emails and other documents. Investigators had been trying to determine whether Mr. Stone or any of Mr. Trump’s other associates were part of any illegal scheme orchestrated by the Russians or WikiLeaks to influence the election, according to two people briefed on the inquiry.To charge a defendant with such a conspiracy, prosecutors would need to show much more than what they allege in Mr. Stone’s indictment. They would have to show the defendant agreed with one or more people to commit a crime and knew the objective of the criminal scheme and took action to further it, said John Marston, a former assistant United States attorney who is now a partner at the law firm Foley Hoag.Prosecutors would not have to prove that the defendant knew every aspect of the conspiracy, Mr. Marston said. “But the government really needs something to show more than that the person was just associating with other bad actors, or merely aware of what the bad actors were doing,” he said.Mr. Stone is the latest Trump associate charged with lyingThe special counsel has charged six other Trump associates on allegations of lying to Congress or federal authorities. Among them were Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser; Michael D. Cohen, the president’s longtime lawyer and fixer; and Rick Gates, the former Trump deputy campaign manager.In May 2017, Mr. Stone falsely told the House Intelligence Committee that he never discussed his WikiLeaks communications with anyone in the Trump campaign, according to the indictment. He also lied when he told the committee that he had no documents of interest to the House investigators, when in fact he had dozens of relevant emails and text messages, prosecutors said.He also falsely denied that he had asked intermediaries to pass along requests to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, for documents that he believed would hurt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to the indictment.He was also charged with trying to prevent an associate from contradicting his lies in his own testimony to the House committee. “Stonewall it. Plead the fifth,” he texted the associate.Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.Pete Buttigieg’s notion of “intergenerational justice” — the subject of one of my newsletters last week — sent me on a data hunt. I dug into the numbers on income, wealth and other issues to see how millennials, baby boomers, my own Generation X and others are faring.The results tell a clear story, and it’s the story I tell in my column today: The fleecing of millennials. If you don’t have time to read the full column right now, check out the first two charts.Is Nancy Pelosi tired of winning yet?President Trump’s disconnection from reality is sometimes a big political advantage for him. Without any apparent interest in the facts, he is often able to persuade his supporters to believe whatever story is most favorable to himself. Other times, however, this disconnection from reality ends up hurting Trump.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The now-paused government shutdown is a good case study. Trump never had a good plan for ending the shutdown. He evidently figured he could bluff his way out of a political trap. But Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, knew better. She knew that the politics favored the Democrats, not Trump. She understood that the shutdown was hurting him and that he would ultimately need to fold. On Friday, fold he did. It was one more reminder that Pelosi is the most effective speaker of modern times.In New York magazine, Sarah Jones notes that Pelosi wasn’t the only protagonist in the story. So were the federal workers — especially air traffic controllers, flight attendants and T.S.A. and I.R.S. employees — who began missing work in large enough numbers to create problems for the rest of the country. “Workers bore the cost of the shutdown, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that they began to revolt. By withholding their labor, they redirected the pain the Trump administration had inflicted upon them,” Jones writes. The Mueller report, a previewOver the weekend, Jennifer Taub of Vermont Law School put together an excellent summary of the findings that Robert Mueller’s investigation has produced. “Pay attention to documents already filed,” Taub tweeted. “Through them, we’ve seen much of the Mueller Report. And it is spectacular.” Taub’s list:George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, lied to the F.B.I. about his extensive contacts with a London-based professor who said he was close with Russian officials and had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos then informed higher-ranking campaign officials of these contacts.Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, lied to the F.B.I. about phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He had coordinated those calls with at least one other member of the Trump transition team.Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney, lied to Congress about a planned Trump business deal in Moscow. Paul Manafort, shortly before becoming Trump’s campaign chairman, shared campaign polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian with apparent ties to Russian military intelligence. Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, lied to Congress about his attempts to communicate with WikiLeaks, which is closely linked to 12 Russian intelligence officials who hacked Democrats’ emails.During the 2016 campaign and after, Trump repeatedly lied about his own Russian contacts.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

Trump was closing in on the Republican presidential nomination.“Failure of memory is not akin to a false statement,” Mr. Manafort’s lawyers said.If the federal judge in Washington who is overseeing the case, Amy Berman Jackson, decides that Mr. Manafort intentionally misled the prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with them, she would presumably be less likely to show leniency on March 5, when she is to sentence him on two conspiracy charges.But as a practical matter, Mr. Manafort, 69, stood little chance of receiving less than 10 years for those crimes even before prosecutors accused him of breaching his plea agreement by lying to them about his dealings with Mr. Kilimnik and other matters. He is also awaiting sentencing for eight other felonies.Judge Jackson has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the prosecutors’ accusations.The defense team’s 10-page filing was heavily redacted, but information inadvertently revealed in a previous court document made it possible to understand some of the lawyers’ references.They suggested that prosecutors had concluded that Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, had lied about the polling data transfer after they compared his statements to those of Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s longtime deputy both in private business and during the campaign. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Manafort instructed Mr. Gates to transfer the information to Mr. Kilimnik, a longtime business associate of both men.“The O.S.C. relies on Mr. Gates’s testimony in an effort to contradict Mr. Manafort,” the defense lawyers wrote, referring to the Office of Special Counsel. Why they contend that the prosecutors were wrong to do so is redacted.The prosecutors have also accused Mr. Manafort of lying about how $125,000 donated to a pro-Trump political action committee was used to cover some of Mr. Manafort’s debts for his legal defense. Investigators were apparently trying to determine whether the payment, made in 2017, constituted a kickback to Mr. Manafort from associates who ran the PAC.But others familiar with the payment said that money was drawn from a commission owed to a PAC official who wanted to help Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort’s lawyers wrote that he did not lie to the prosecutors about the payment, he simply “had difficulty remembering the details of what occurred.”A lawyer for Laurence Gay, who was once the managing director of the PAC, Rebuilding America Now, said in a statement that the money came from a different set of funds.“In 2017 and at the request of Paul Manafort, Laurie asked that funds be forwarded to an entity designated by Mr. Manafort to assist with his legal expenses,” said the lawyer, Anthony J. Iacullo, in response to a request for comment from Mr. Gay. “This was done with funds independent from those belonging to the PAC.” He did not identify the source of funds.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, had originally pledged to give “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump.CreditCreditStephanie Keith for The New York TimesBy Maggie HabermanJan. 23, 2019WASHINGTON — Michael D. Cohen, the former personal lawyer and fixer for President Trump, indefinitely postponed his congressional testimony set for next month, his lawyer said on Wednesday, depriving House Democrats of one of their first big spectacles in their plans to aggressively investigate the Trump administration.Mr. Cohen’s lawyer Lanny J. Davis cited verbal attacks from Mr. Trump, who had begun suggesting after Mr. Cohen agreed to testify that one of his relatives be investigated for unspecified crimes.Democrats called the president’s attacks “textbook mob tactics” of coercion. “The most upsetting thing about all of this is the fact that Mr. Cohen was intimidated,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the House Oversight Committee who had invited Mr. Cohen to testify, said in an interview. “And not only was he intimidated, but he believes his family also has been intimidated and threatened.”Mr. Trump denied the charge, telling reporters at the White House that Mr. Cohen, who was sentenced last month to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, was “threatened by the truth.”Mr. Cohen’s decision to back out of the hearing was a final retreat from what had initially promised to be a blockbuster hearing. He has said he does not want to be the “villain” of the Trump presidency and had originally pledged to give “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, though lawmakers had warned that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would most likely keep him from discussing matters related to Russia.Mr. Cohen’s deferral also put House Democrats in an awkward position. They must decide whether to force Mr. Cohen to testify despite his concerns about security or walk away altogether from a hearing that they held out as the first marquee moment in their plan to showcase their aggressive oversight of Mr. Trump and his administration.Mr. Cummings said he would decide soon whether to subpoena Mr. Cohen to compel his testimony or if he will allow him to testify behind closed doors. Mr. Cohen is due to report to prison on March 6.Privately, Mr. Trump’s aides had predicted that Mr. Cohen would back out of his appearance on Capitol Hill as Republicans prepared to raise questions about his character, including asking questions about his work before he joined the Trump Organization and his own antagonism toward reporters while he worked for Mr. Trump.The president has repeatedly suggested on Twitter that Mr. Cohen’s family members be scrutinized. In a recent interview with Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host and one of Mr. Trump’s preferred interviewers, he called for Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law to be investigated without citing details.Mr. Trump has referenced the Eastern European background of Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, to imply that Mr. Shusterman has ties to organized crime. No evidence has emerged to back up that suggestion. Mr. Shusterman was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty in 1993, a year before Mr. Cohen married his daughter, to cashing $5.5 million in checks to evade federal reporting requirements. It is not clear that Mr. Trump is aware of that case.A retiree, Mr. Shusterman emigrated to the United States in the early 1970s after facing anti-Jewish persecution in Soviet-controlled Ukraine, Mr. Cohen has told friends.VideoMichael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about plans to build a tower for Mr. Trump in Russia. The admission is the latest twist in the onetime Trump loyalist’s deteriorating relationship with the president.CreditCreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesMr. Trump has also suggested the men have significant financial ties, which Mr. Cohen has denied. The president’s interview with Ms. Pirro prompted a rare statement from House Democrats cautioning that any effort to discourage or influence witness testimony before Congress could be construed as a crime.The president’s allies in Congress dismissed the notion that his attacks constituted a threat to Mr. Cohen. “Everyone knows it wasn’t witness intimidation — c’mon,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said in a brief interview. “If he comes, we’ll be ready. If he doesn’t, he doesn’t.”Mr. Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and another close ally of the president, indicated in a letter this week seeking documents from Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Guy Petrillo, that his client would face aggressive questioning from House Republicans.Mr. Trump’s allies have acknowledged privately for months that Mr. Cohen’s willingness to reveal the details of his work for Mr. Trump to prosecutors and the public stands as one of the most significant threats to the Trump presidency. In pleading guilty last year to helping arrange hush payments during the campaign to women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen implicated the president, and prosecutors later said Mr. Trump directed the payments. The president has acknowledged that the money for the payments came from him after initially denying that he knew about them.Mr. Cohen was also central to the Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow, trying to secure permits for the plan during the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing the plan as part of his investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia’s election interference.Late last year, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress by testifying to congressional investigators that work on the project ended by January 2016. Prosecutors have said that negotiations continued until at least June of that year, and Mr. Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged this weekend that they went on through the election, though he later sought to distance himself from that assertion.The project has gained renewed attention in recent days — and Mr. Trump and his lawyer began attacking Mr. Cohen again — after a disputed report last week by BuzzFeed News said that Mr. Mueller had evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the project. In a rare statement, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller called the article “inaccurate.”Mr. Cohen has spent more than 70 hours in interviews with investigators for the Southern District of New York who prosecuted the campaign finance violations and for Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s 2016 election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign.Once one of Mr. Trump’s loyal aides, Mr. Cohen fell out of favor with the president after pleading guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. The president, who had urged Mr. Cohen to stay “strong” when federal agents raided his apartment, hotel room and office in April, switched gears and branded Mr. Cohen a convicted liar, weak and even a “rat.”Mr. Davis compared Mr. Trump’s attacks on his client to a scene from the second “Godfather” movie and said that Mr. Trump was aware that Mr. Cohen’s “vulnerability” is his concern for his family.The statements by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, who have accused Mr. Cohen of lying to get a reduced sentence, would most likely amount to sufficient evidence of witness tampering, according to legal experts, though they cautioned that prosecutors would bring such a case only if they viewed the tampering as part of a larger pattern of obstructive behavior. And a longstanding Justice Department view has held that a sitting president cannot be indicted.For prosecutors to gain a conviction, they need to show only an attempt to influence testimony, not that the witness was actually deterred from speaking, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior Justice Department and F.B.I. official.“Even if Cohen said the comments did not intimidate him, and that he would testify, those comments could still constitute witness tampering,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “The statute criminalizes the conduct of those who attempt to intimidate witnesses, not just those who succeed.”Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

Stone Jr., a former political adviser to President Trump, has often tried to write himself into history.CreditCreditJesse Dittmar for The New York TimesBy Annie Karni and Maggie HabermanJan. 25, 2019WASHINGTON — For two years, Roger J. Stone Jr. has seemed like the most obvious suspect in an old-fashioned mystery, the self-described dirty trickster taunting the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to come at him while selling T-shirts proclaiming his innocence.Mr. Stone has tried to write himself into history since he worked on the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon, whose face is tattooed between his shoulder blades, and his critics say he often overstates his own role in the dark arts of politics. But Mr. Stone set his sights on becoming a celebrity, and when F.B.I. agents burst into his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home on Friday morning to take him into custody, he found himself where he has always wanted to be — center stage.Emerging from the courthouse after his arraignment, Mr. Stone, dressed in a plain navy blue cotton polo shirt and bluejeans, threw up his arms in a Nixon-esque victory salute and shouted what has been the mantra of his colorful career.“I have always said, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about,” Mr. Stone said, announcing that he would plead not guilty and accusing the F.B.I. SWAT team that burst into his house of terrorizing his wife and two Yorkies.[Read more about Mr. Stone’s arrest and the charges against him.]Court papers suggested that Mr. Stone’s claims that he was somehow connected to the timing of WikiLeaks’ release of emails that damaged Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign may have been more than just puffery or swagger.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, has been charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He was arrested in a pre-dawn F.B.I. raid in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and appeared in court on Friday.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesIn an interview after he was released from custody, Mr. Stone said he believed that “these charges are politically motivated,” and called them trumped up to compensate for the special counsel’s inability to prove collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.“Roger has been so skillful over the years at feeding the legend that Mueller believed him, or at least conveniently wanted to,” Matt Labash, a conservative who wrote a definitive profile of Mr. Stone for The Weekly Standard in 2007, said on Friday.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Stone played up his role as a conduit to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, suggesting they had spoken and that he had advance knowledge of the website’s publication of hacked emails from John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. He also exchanged messages on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by Russian intelligence agents to scheme and steal emails and direct them to WikiLeaks.“It will soon” be “the Podesta’s time in the barrel,” Mr. Stone tweeted in August 2016, ahead of WikiLeaks’ publication of Mr. Podesta’s emails. The tweet was taken as a reference to Mr. Podesta; Mr. Stone has insisted he was referring to the Podesta brothers, including Tony Podesta, a prominent lobbyist.Mr. Stone has since been suspended from Twitter, and also at times changed his story, claiming that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the hacking of the Democrats, and retracting his claim that he had personally communicated with Mr. Assange. He has described it as merely an attempt to promote himself.Mr. Stone’s tactics of claiming credit for scandal-mongering and then vanishing from the scene of the crime go back decades.ImageMr. Trump and Mr. Stone in 1999. Their relationship, over the years, has proved to be fraught but durable.CreditDaniel Hulshizer/Associated PressIn 2007, he resigned as a political aide to a top New York Republican lawmaker after being accused of leaving a threatening voice mail message for Bernard Spitzer, the father of Gov. Eliot Spitzer.In the profanity-laced message, he allegedly told the elder Mr. Spitzer, who had Parkinson’s disease, that he would be “compelled by the Senate sergeant-at-arms” to testify about “shady campaign loans” made to his son during a failed campaign for attorney general in 1994, and that he would be “arrested and brought to Albany” if he resisted.Mr. Stone denied the charges, claiming as an alibi that he was at the Broadway show “Frost/Nixon” the night of the alleged call. But Mr. Stone was undaunted when it turned out that the play was dark that Monday. “My wife already reminded me I actually saw the play on a Wednesday,” he said. “I still recommend the play to the governor.”But his war with the Spitzer family was not over. In 2008, after Mr. Spitzer resigned from office after he was caught on a federal wiretap arranging to meet high-priced prostitutes, Mr. Stone claimed credit for spreading the rumor that the governor wore his black dress socks during his sexual encounters with prostitutes, an indelible image that has stuck to Mr. Spitzer.Mr. Stone began burnishing his legend as a 19-year-old political wunderkind willing to break the rules.Using a pseudonym, he made political contributions from the Young Socialist Alliance to the Republican challenging Mr. Nixon for the party’s nomination in 1972, Pete McCloskey. He then presented the campaign donation to a newspaper as proof that Mr. Nixon’s opponent was a puppet of the left. He also hired an operative to try to infiltrate the campaign of George McGovern, the Democratic nominee. That prank cost him a job with Senator Bob Dole.ImagePaul Manafort, left, Mr. Stone, and Lee Atwater in Washington in 1985. Mr. Stone’s high jinks did not stop him from at one point becoming part of the Washington establishment.CreditHarry Naltchayan/The Washington Post, via Getty ImagesBut he was hardly recognized for his efforts. The Nixon Foundation, pointing out his age at the time, said on Friday that any characterization of him as a Nixon campaign aide or adviser was “a gross misstatement.”Mr. Stone’s willingness to toe the line between playfulness and villainy was not something he outgrew.He wrote online columns and had his own website. A man who took pride in his natty clothes like custom suits with wide pinstripes and broad lapels, Mr. Stone published an annual “best dressed” column in The Daily Caller, the conservative website. Before he was suspended from Twitter, Mr. Stone used the site to play out long-running gags. For instance, he pretended that his friend and associate Randy Credico was dead and tweeted about it frequently, even having mass cards printed about his passing. Mr. Credico is referenced in the indictment of Mr. Stone, but not by name.His texts with Mr. Credico showed him urging his friend to “do a Frank Pentangeli,” a reference to a character in “The Godfather: Part II.” In the movie, the character lies to a congressional committee to avoid damaging the head of the mafia family, Michael Corleone.But in his dealings with President Trump’s campaign, Mr. Stone’s appetite for pushing the limits of the law finally crossed a line, prosecutors said.“Roger has a long track record of self-destructive behavior, and he is more often than not his own worst enemy,” said Morgan Pehme, the journalist and filmmaker who helped write and direct the Netflix documentary “Get Me Roger Stone,” which was released last year. “This indictment seems to reflect that trend in his life.”Mr. Stone’s high jinks did not prevent him from at one point becoming part of the Washington establishment. Alongside Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman convicted of financial fraud, he created the powerhouse consulting firm Black, Manafort and Stone in the 1980s. The firm, a product of Reagan-era Washington, helped create the “swamp” culture of selling influence, representing, among other clients, dictators and foreign political parties that were accused of ties to drug trafficking.One of their early clients was Mr. Trump, who had been introduced to Mr. Stone by Roy Cohn, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and mentor, who also counted Mr. Stone as one of his protégés.Their relationship, over the years, has proved to be fraught but durable, marked by repeated falling-outs and reconciliations. In 2011, Mr. Stone was involved in Mr. Trump’s deliberations over running against President Barack Obama. He gave interviews saying that Mr. Trump had billions to spend on a campaign, and laid out a message that was close to Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan of 2016. But when Mr. Stone got too much attention, Mr. Trump told reporters that his adviser was not speaking for him.Mr. Trump eventually opted out of a race in 2012, choosing instead to continue on with his reality show, “The Apprentice.” When Mr. Trump briefly explored a potential run for governor in New York in 2013, Mr. Stone advised against it. Mr. Stone was one of the few early aides involved in the 2015 race until he quit a few months into the campaign; Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Stone was fired.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has at times become enraged at what he sees as excessive news media attention surrounding Mr. Stone. People close to the president have long maintained that he is leery of his old adviser, only interested in keeping Mr. Stone near enough that he would not feel cast aside. Yet time and again, Mr. Trump — who refers to him as “Rog” — would turn to his old friend.Ultimately, the question from the indictment is what the campaign — and Mr. Trump — may have known about Mr. Stone’s correspondence.In Mr. Pehme’s documentary, Mr. Manafort was filmed at length discussing how intertwined Mr. Stone is with the president. “It’s hard to define what’s Roger and what’s Donald,” Mr. Manafort says in the film. “They both see the world in a very similar way.”Speaking outside federal court, appearing unbowed, and even to be taking pleasure in the spectacle, Mr. Stone said he would not testify against the president. “I am one of his oldest friends,” he said. “I am a fervent supporter of the president.”Correction: Jan. 27, 2019Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article misidentified the organization that disputed characterizations of Mr. Stone as a Nixon campaign aide or adviser. It was the Nixon Foundation, not the Nixon Library.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Trickster’ Who Is Right Where He Wants to Be.

What Was He Hiding?Could the Trump campaign really not have known that in dealing with WikiLeaks it was dealing with Russia?By The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Jan. 25, 2019ImageCreditCreditIllustration by Alex Merto; Photograph by Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesIn his indictment of the Trump torpedo Roger Stone, the special counsel Robert Mueller noted that on June 14, 2016, the Democratic National Committee announced “that it had been hacked by Russian government actors.” According to the indictment, unsealed Friday, Mr. Stone participated in and helped conceal an effort by the Trump campaign to cooperate with WikiLeaks in publicizing thousands of emails stolen from the Clinton campaign, which was done to devastating political effect. Mr. Stone stands accused of obstructing an official proceeding, making multiple false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness.Around June and July of 2016, the indictment says, Mr. Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” that WikiLeaks possessed stolen emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s chances of being president. It released the first batch on July 22, roiling the Democratic National Convention, which began three days later. Maybe Mr. Trump and his associates had no idea who stole the emails and did not connect this bonanza with “Russian government actors.”Mr. Trump and his associates might have thought that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was just being a mischievous scamp, not passing along communications stolen by Russian intelligence, most of which came from the hacker Guccifer 2.0, an online persona created by Russian military intelligence officers. Mr. Stone said in 2017 that he had carried out “completely innocuous” private Twitter exchanges with Guccifer 2.0 during the presidential campaign. But then why did Mr. Trump say, five days after the first WikiLeaks release, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”And might not the Trump circle have suspected that WikiLeaks was working with Russia after Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and the campaign chairman Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, with Russians who were peddling dirt on Mrs. Clinton?And if Mr. Trump’s first F.B.I. intelligence briefing on Aug. 17, 2016, included a warning about Russian espionage, as NBC News reported in 2017, why didn’t Mr. Trump or anyone else in the campaign tell the agents about the meeting or the suspicious release of emails?After the first WikiLeaks release, the indictment says, “a senior Trump Campaign official was directed” — presumably by someone even more senior — to contact Mr. Stone about what dirt the group had on the Clinton campaign. If the Trump campaign had not known that it was getting dirt from Russia, why did George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser whom Mr. Trump called “an excellent guy,” plead guilty to lying about his contact with a professor who said he had dirt from Russia on Mrs. Clinton? (Mr. Papadopoulos’s lawyer said his client had taken his cues from Mr. Trump, and that “the president of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could.”) Why did the former national security adviser Michael Flynn plead guilty to falsely telling the F.B.I. that he had not talked to the Russian ambassador about easing economic sanctions? And why did Mr. Trump craft a false story about the Trump Tower meeting, and falsely claim again and again that he had no business dealings with Russia even when his associates were negotiating with aides to President Vladimir Putin about a project in Moscow that could have earned him hundreds of millions of dollars?Mr. Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon told the author Michael Wolff that he thought the Trump Tower meeting was “treasonous.” Yet he had no problem cooperating with WikiLeaks, according to the indictment. He is apparently the “high-ranking Trump Campaign official” who asked Mr. Stone on Oct. 4, 2016, about future WikiLeaks releases. Three days later, after the first stolen emails from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were released, one of Mr. Bannon’s associates texted Mr. Stone, “well done.”No one should jump to conclusions in this case. As president, Mr. Trump may have held himself to be above the law, but he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. For their part, the American people are entitled to some answers.RelatedOpinion | Gail CollinsIf Trump Were Tony Soprano…Jan. 25, 2019Indicting Roger Stone, Mueller Shows Link Between Trump Campaign and WikiLeaksJan. 25, 2019Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Roger Stone Lied.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexMediaSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperMedia|The Tabloid Myths of Jennifer Aniston and Donald TrumpAdvertisementSupported byThe Tabloid Myths of Jennifer Aniston and Donald TrumpImageThe numerous tabloid reports that Jennifer Aniston is back together with Brad Pitt and pregnant are “completely false,” her publicist said.CreditCreditValerie Macon/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Jim RutenbergJan. 27, 2019阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版In a depressing news cycle, the cover of In Touch Weekly’s Jan. 21 issue was a beautiful sight.It was a blast from a less complicated past, with its vintage photograph of a beaming Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt staring out at readers from above the bold headline: “We’re Having a Girl!”For some who saw it in the racks, me included, the cover of this supermarket tabloid provided a double dose of joy. Not only was the It Couple of the late 1990s and early aughts back together — they were about to be parents.But wait a minute.The story rang a bell, and when I looked into it, I found that In Touch had devoted its cover to a similar piece of news back in October, with a story headlined “Brad & Jen Baby Announcement! ‘Our Dream Finally Came True!’” That one included the persuasive-seeming detail that the father-to-be was “designing the nursery in their new home.”And what about that other time Ms. Aniston was pregnant? In July, the In Touch cover promised, “Bombshell Pregnancy News!” — and that was just the icing atop the wedding cake of the headline “Brad & Jen: Just Married! Inside the Backyard Ceremony.”Before that, in May, OK! magazine, which shares an owner with In Touch, American Media Inc., ran a cover photo of a happy Ms. Aniston and Mr. Pitt with the headline: “Yes, I’m Pregnant — With Brad’s Baby!”Going by the tabloid reports, I found that Ms. Aniston should have given birth to some two dozen babies in the last few years. According to OK! alone, she has acquired up to 15 kids since 2013, having been pregnant nine times — twice with twins! — while also adopting a third set of twins.ImageFalse. False. False. The denials have not stopped In Touch magazine from going with a story that sells.The website Gossip Cop has debunked some of the above-mentioned reports. And when I called Ms. Aniston’s publicist, Stephen Huvane, he confirmed that she was not pregnant. He also said that Ms. Aniston has no children and — it pains me to reveal — she is not back together with Mr. Pitt, who was her husband from 2000 to 2005.The publicist sounded more than a little weary of dealing with the tabloids.“Every week I get these emails, ‘We’re working on a story that Jennifer is pregnant,’” Mr. Huvane said. “I will say, ‘This is a complete fabrication. There’s no truth to this or this is all ridiculous and completely false.’ And they still go with the story.”It’s no mystery why In Touch and OK! keep printing these false stories. At a time when gossip magazines are suffering right along with more serious publications and digital outlets, they no longer have the reporting ranks they once relied on to dig up real celebrity scoops.And these days they are careful to go with stories that sell. What’s strange, though, is that some of us keep coming back for more, despite their abysmal track record.Whether the subject is celebrities or politics, readers can be easy marks for comforting tales. Tabloid publishers know this. So do online trolls and click-hungry websites.“Algorithmic behavior existed long before there was an algorithm,” said Janice Min, the former top editor of The Hollywood Reporter and before that, Us Weekly, which she established as a place for real celebrity exclusives.ImageMr. Pitt and Ms. Aniston in 2004. They officially separated the next year.CreditFrank Trapper/Corbis, via Getty ImagesAnd one thing that fires up the algorithm is the idea that Ms. Aniston is going to have a baby.“Whether politics or celebrity, narratives are what matter to people — the details often don’t,” said Ms. Min, who is now overseeing content and news at Quibi, the mobile video start-up from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg.And the gossip industry provides a rich, if anachronistic, narrative indeed: The approachable-seeming Ms. Aniston gets the better of a glamorous rival — Angelina Jolie — and finds contentment through being reunited with the supposed love of her life. And baby makes three (or 18).Never mind that Ms. Aniston herself finds that view of a woman’s happiness to be offensive. “We don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete,” she wrote in 2016 HuffPost essay that debunked the endless false tabloid reports about her love life and supposed pregnancies.“With Jennifer Aniston, you have to start with the fundamental thing that people like her, and they’re pulling for her,” said Larry Hackett, the former editor of People magazine. “They would like to see her have the baby, because they’re operating under this archaic, old-fashioned notion that without a baby she must be unhappy.”Mr. Hackett sagely noted that the mix of reality and fantasy contained in the Aniston story line isn’t all that different from the contrived, highly edited versions of reality presented by “unscripted” shows like “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” still going strong in its 15th season. More important for the purposes of this column, it’s not all that different from a onetime stalwart of the genre, “The Apprentice.”As Patrick Radden Keefe wrote in a recent article on “The Apprentice” for The New Yorker, Donald J. Trump’s star had dimmed in the years before it aired. By papering over his business organizations’ bankruptcies, not to mention the fraud accusations against Trump University, the NBC prime-time hit “mythologized him anew, turning him into an icon of American success.”ImageAn advertisement for “The Apprentice” on Trump Tower in New York in 2004. As a recent article in The New Yorker put it, the NBC show with Donald Trump “mythologized him anew, turning him into an icon of American success.”CreditBebeto Matthews/Associated PressMr. Trump ran his campaign and at times runs his White House with a reliance on the same mix of fantasy and truthiness typical of supermarket tabloids and reality TV. Just as a large group of people can’t get enough of the tales about Ms. Aniston, a large constituency seems eager to believe a reality-show narrative about the 45th president.On “The Apprentice,” he was a straight-shooting, street-smart businessman. To rally-goers during his campaign, he was the outsider who sought to smash a calcified ruling elite. As president, he has been the man willing to fight off resistance from “the deep state” to do what’s right, even if it means shutting down the government.In this scenario, the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III plays the role filled by Ms. Jolie in the Aniston saga — the foil who thrives on thwarting our protagonist.Just as I have found myself tempted to believe the Pregnant Jen story line, the president’s fans seem more than willing to embrace this version of reality — a story line that has been fleshed out by The National Enquirer, his unignorable Twitter feed, his Fox News cheering section (Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, the gang at “Fox & Friends”), his radio boosters (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin), and his longtime adviser Roger Stone, who fed a new “deep state” theory to Infowars a week before his arrest on Friday.The desire to believe helps explain polls like the one from Quinnipiac late last year reporting that 83 percent of Republicans view Mr. Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt,” despite the string of indictments, convictions and guilty pleas that preceded the charges against Mr. Stone.Driving the belief in political conspiracy theories and celebrity pregnancies alike is “a desire to have the truth fit” the heart’s desires, said Renée Ann Cramer, a professor of law, politics and society at Drake University in Iowa. “They want it to be true,” she said.Ms. Cramer is well positioned to connect the dots between the coverage of Ms. Aniston and Mr. Trump. In addition to her public policy expertise, she is the author of “Pregnant With the Stars: Watching and Wanting the Celebrity Baby Bump.”An attractive narrative emits a powerful force, whether it’s about politics or things less serious, and we’re all susceptible to its allure. Here’s hoping the truth will prove more powerful than what people want to believe when Mr. Mueller issues his report.Follow Jim Rutenberg on Twitter: @jimrutenberg.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|If Trump Were Tony Soprano…AdvertisementOpinionSupported byIf Trump Were Tony Soprano…The gang that couldn’t conspire straight.By Gail CollinsOpinion ColumnistJan. 25, 2019ImageRoger Stone arriving in 2017 for a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.CreditCreditAl Drago for The New York TimesReading about the indictment of Donald Trump’s longtime pal Roger Stone, you can’t help thinking that we’ve got a president whose circle of associates closely resembles the guys Tony Soprano used to hang around with outside the pork shop in New Jersey.Stone is a proud, self-proclaimed political dirty trickster. According to the Mueller indictment, he is also a witness tamperer who once threatened to kidnap the therapy dog of an associate who had been subpoenaed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.That’s not necessarily the most important part of the charges, but I knew you’d want to hear about it first. The witness is Randy Credico, a former radio personality who Stone said served as an intermediary between him and the WikiLeaks folk who released all those stolen Clinton campaign emails.The indictment says Stone accused Credico of being “a rat. A stoolie” and warned that he would “rip you to shreds” and “take that dog away from you.”ImageRandy Credico heading to court in September with his therapy dog and his lawyer.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesCredico has a little white emotional support dog named Bianca. Doesn’t this sound like something Paulie Walnuts would have done around “Sopranos” Season 4?Moving on. The biggest news in the Mueller indictment was its charge that somebody told “a senior Trump campaign official” to contact Stone about any “damaging information” that WikiLeaks might have about the Clinton campaign. And that Stone reported back about stuff that just might be coming out in the near future.Who do you think that Somebody could be? A person with receding hair and a taste for ultralong ties who recently kept the government shut for more than a month for no good reason whatsoever? Your guess is as good as mine.And which senior campaign official do you think Somebody told to contact Stone? The former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, since convicted of financial fraud? Former campaign adviser Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.? Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, formerly in prison for lying to the F.B.I.?How about lawyer Michael Cohen, now sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress? If Trump and the gang were a Sopranos remake, Cohen would be “Big Pussy” Bonpensiero, who turned on Tony after being busted himself.Really, there’s so much talent there, it could have been anybody.Stone and Trump go way back. They were introduced about 40 years ago by their good mutual friend Roy Cohn, the guy who gave us the McCarthy witch hunts. Trump still burbles about how great Cohn was. And he enthused to a documentary interviewer that Stone is “a quality guy” who “always wanted me to run for president.”Can’t get a better recommendation than that. Stone has a talent for identifying presidential talent — he’s got a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back. He was partners with Paul Manafort in a Washington lobbying firm that specialized in representing the most terrible dictators on the planet. If you had a million dollars, a need for support from the United States government and a small problem with torture, rape and terrorism, these were the guys to see.(A third partner, Charlie Black, said that when reporters called him to ask if Stone was the connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, he replied, “With all due respect, Roger couldn’t find Russia on a map.” As always, when we’re considering possible crimes committed during the 2016 campaign, the best defense of Trump and his associates is that they were too dumb to be capable of plotting.)“I’m proud of the job I did at Black Manafort and Stone because I made a lot of money,” Stone told those documentarians, getting right to the point.Stone’s political career almost came to a crashing end in 1996 when he ran into a scandal that forced him to resign from the Bob Dole campaign. (The candidate was touchy about headlines like “Top Dole Aide Caught in Group Sex Ring.”) Stone blamed the story on a lying, disgruntled former employee. Later, he admitted that it was true, and explained that he needed to deny it because “my grandparents were still alive.”But no matter, he would go on triumphantly to organize a wild protest that stopped the recount of votes after the Gore-Bush election in Florida. Or maybe not. Stone bragged that he was the guy who staged one of the most spectacular assaults on the democratic process in recent history, but there was competition for the title.And then on to Donald Trump. He and Stone had worked on his political career for ages. (Although Stone doesn’t take credit for Trump’s Obama birther campaign, he’s said that he didn’t discourage the idea.) The two men parted company in 2015 — Stone claimed he’d quit because he was dismayed by Trump’s “provocative media fights.”But then next thing you know we’re in 2016, and they’re pals again. Those Clinton campaign emails are stolen and released. According to Stone’s indictment: A “high-ranking Trump campaign official sent a text message to Stone that read ‘well done.’”That would be a memorable moment. Not often when “well done” comes up in connection with the Trump crew.RelatedOpinion | The Editorial BoardRoger Stone Lied.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s Paper6 Takeaways From the Mitch McConnell ProfileAdvertisementSupported by6 Takeaways From the Mitch McConnell ProfileImagePresident Trump and McConnell after a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill.CreditCreditOlivier Douliery/Getty ImagesBy The New York Times MagazineJan. 24, 2019Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky and current Senate majority leader, has had a complex relationship with President Trump. McConnell has been “the principal enabler of the Trump agenda,” as McConnell’s longtime adviser J. Scott Jennings describes him, and much of his enduring legacy has been established during Trump’s presidency. But McConnell, a man of institutions and establishments, has also found himself in the position of supporting a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground, and is now trying to navigate a prolonged shutdown of Trump’s making. “I’m perplexed,” he said earlier this month, “as to how this ends.”For the profile of McConnell in this week’s Times Magazine, Charles Homans interviewed McConnell for several hours over the course of two months, and also spoke to several dozen of his past and present staff members, Republican and Democratic senators, and Trump and Obama White House officials and cabinet members. Here are some key takeaways:McConnell takes credit for the Trump win in the 2016 election.When the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell blocked President Obama from filling his seat — a decision that McConnell describes as “the most consequential thing I’ve ever done.” He takes credit for Trump’s election on the grounds that some exit polling shows that voters were heavily motivated by the Supreme Court vacancy that McConnell kept open.McConnell’s other decisions during the campaign, intentionally or otherwise, may have helped Trump.After the C.I.A. alerted congressional leaders of both parties — McConnell, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, the House speaker Paul Ryan and the House minority leader Nancy Pelosi — to evidence of Russian meddling in the election in August 2016, several weeks passed before the leaders issued a statement. Denis McDonough, President Obama’s chief of staff at the time, blames the delay on McConnell, who he says had concerns with the wording of the statement. McDonough says that even Ryan, who broadly agreed with McConnell, nevertheless complained to him about the holdup. “At the time,” McDonough said, “the speaker evinced to me considerable frustration.”McConnell also chose not to distance Republican Senate candidates from Trump after the Access Hollywood video, in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women, was published by the Washington Post. “He said, ‘Do you see any evidence that it would make any difference for candidates to distance themselves?’” Josh Holmes, a campaign strategist close to McConnell who spoke to him at the time, recalled. After speaking with Republican candidates, McConnell decided that a broader denouncement of Trump was likely to hurt them, and instead made a statement speaking only for himself.McConnell was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to fill the judiciary with conservative judges.Though his public endorsement of Trump in May 2016 was noticeably lukewarm, McConnell urged him to work with the Federalist Society, the conservative legal organization, in planning his appointments to the 106 seats on the federal judiciary — including Scalia’s Supreme Court seat — that McConnell had held open during the Obama years. By August he had begun discussing the project with Donald F. McGahn II, Trump’s campaign lawyer and, later, White House counsel. After the election, McConnell told his chief of staff, “We are going to move judges like they are on a conveyor belt.”Paul Ryan, the former House speaker, says that he and McConnell had agreed upon a plan for if Trump fired Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor.Ryan, who left office this month, said he and McConnell had planned for a scenario in which Trump decided to fire Mueller. Ryan declined to describe what the plan was, but said: “Did we discuss it? Yes, we discussed it. Yes, we were prepared if that actually would have happened.” He added: “I can answer that with a question: Has the guy been fired? No, he’s continuing on.” (McConnell declined to comment on the plan.)James Mattis, the defense secretary until December, sent foreign leaders to see McConnell for reassurance.Among McConnell’s allies in the Trump administration was James Mattis, the defense secretary, who quit in December, expressing concerns that his views on the United States’s alliances—which McConnell shared—differed from Trump’s. Speaking shortly before leaving office, Mattis declined to discuss directly his differences with Trump, but said that “when foreign ministers of defense or foreign leaders visited and they asked who they should talk with, I always spoke about Leader McConnell, because he could reassure them.”Despite their working together for the past two years, McConnell rejects the idea that his own legacy is tied to Trump’s.“I think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office,” McConnell said, but which he meant his decision to block Obama’s appointment to Scalia’s seat. As for the rest of Trump’s domestic agenda, “he’s done what I thought ought to be done”: appointing judges, scaling back regulations, signing the sweeping tax bill House and Senate Republicans were able to pass in late 2017. “If Marco Rubio had been president, we’d have done it. If Jeb Bush had been president, we’d have done it. I say that not to take anything away from President Trump, but he took good advice on all three of those areas that are traditional Republican positions.”Related CoverageMitch McConnell Got Everything He Wanted.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with a new indictment in Robert Mueller’s investigation, the increasingly urgent talks as the government shutdown continues and the leadership crisis in Venezuela. And it’s Friday, so there’s a new news quiz.Roger Stone is charged in the special counsel inquiryMr. Stone, a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, was arrested today and charged by Robert Mueller’s office with seven counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements and witness tampering.The indictment is the first public move in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates.A self-described dirty trickster who began his career as a campaign aide for Richard Nixon, Mr. Stone has long maintained his innocence.Catch up: Here’s a look at everyone who has been charged in investigations related to the 2016 election.Background: During the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone presented himself to Trump campaign officials as a conduit of information from WikiLeaks, which was releasing damaging Democratic emails.

Here’s how every senator voted.What’s next: House Democrats are preparing to outline more than $5 billion in border security measures, a far larger sum than they initially supported. Mr. Trump mentioned “other alternatives” to break the impasse, presumably an emergency declaration that could allow him to shift funds from the military or the Army Corps of Engineers.News analysis: The president prides himself on being a master negotiator, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi “is a different kind of opponent, and one who so far has flummoxed him,” one of our congressional correspondents writes.The eroding good will of civil servantsAs the shutdown continues, scientists, engineers and other highly skilled employees are starting to question the appeal of government work.“We didn’t get Ph.D.s just to sit around,” said a chemist at NASA, which has rarely struggled to attract top talent. Most of the space agency’s employees have been furloughed during the nearly six-week shutdown.Yesterday: Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, expressed confusion about why furloughed workers were visiting food banks and said they should take out loans. He’s one of several administration officials who have been criticized as sounding out-of-touch about the shutdown’s toll. For you: Aviation unions have raised concerns about the shutdown’s effect on air safety, but the president of the air traffic controllers’ union said, “The flying public is safe.” Here’s what else to know about air travel.A wall that’s out of sync with a region’s politicsPresident Trump has been determined not to disappoint supporters by giving ground on his campaign promise of a border wall.But the Southwest’s growing diversity and the president’s demeaning rhetoric about migrants are pulling parts of the region from the once-firm grip of Republicans. From California to Texas, all nine House members whose districts touch the border say a wall is the wrong solution for border security.Closer look: Two Times journalists are traveling the length of the 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico. Read their latest dispatch.Yesterday: The Trump administration said it would start preventing some asylum seekers from entering the U.S. from Mexico. The policy was first announced last month.ImageA defaced mural of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in the capital, Caracas, on Thursday.CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesSetback for the opposition in VenezuelaThe government of President Nicolás Maduro struck back on Thursday, winning the support of the country’s military as well as that of Russia, which warned the U.S. not to intervene. The opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, had declared himself the country’s legitimate president a day earlier.Forces loyal to Mr. Maduro killed at least 20 people and wounded many more during this week’s protests, the United Nations human rights office said today, citing sources in the country.News analysis: President Trump, who has aligned himself with autocratic leaders around the world, has drawn a red line with Mr. Maduro. Mr. Trump’s stance represents a departure from his “America First” policy of staying out of other nations’ internal affairs, our correspondents write.Explainer: We answered some common questions about the crisis, including the roles played by socialism, Western imperialism, or both.The Daily: Today’s episode discusses the power struggle in Venezuela.If you have 6 minutes, this is worth itThe $238 million penthouse that’s turning headsImageCreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe sale of an under-construction apartment overlooking Central Park has drawn attention even in Manhattan, which is no stranger to multimillion-dollar real estate deals.

His Team Fears a Primary Fight.AdvertisementSupported byA Bruised Trump Faces Uncertain 2020 Prospects. His Team Fears a Primary Fight.ImagePresident Trump at a campaign rally in Belgrade, Mont., in November. He captured the presidency with a largely improvisational candidacy, guided by his own instincts for personal combat and cultural division.CreditCreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesBy Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Maggie HabermanJan. 26, 2019President Trump’s defeat in his border-wall standoff with Congress has clouded his already perilous path to a second term in 2020, undercutting Mr. Trump’s cherished image as a forceful leader and deft negotiator, and emboldening alike his Democratic challengers and Republican dissenters who hope to block his re-election.The longest government shutdown in history inflicted severe political damage on the president, dragging down his poll numbers even among Republicans and stirring concern among party leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years of divided government. Mr. Trump, close associates acknowledge, appears without a plan for mounting a strong campaign in 2020, or for persuading the majority of Americans who view him negatively to give him another chance.Compounding the harm to Mr. Trump on Friday was the indictment of Roger Stone, his political adviser for several decades, on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment was taken by some Republicans as the surest sign yet that Mr. Mueller’s investigation is likely to grow more painful to Mr. Trump and his associates before it wraps up.Mr. Trump still commands the loyalty of a passionate electoral base that has rallied to him in trying moments, and advisers believe he will have room to right himself while Democratic presidential candidates are mired in a long nomination fight. Yet they are also growing anxious that he could face a draining primary of his own next year.Several prominent Trump antagonists are actively urging other Republicans to take on the president, and a popular governor, Larry Hogan of Maryland, has indicated he is newly open to their entreaties.In a sign of the White House’s determination to project party unity, a top Trump campaign official, Bill Stepien, traveled to the Republican National Committee meeting in New Mexico this week to orchestrate an ornamental resolution of support for the president. It passed unanimously on Friday afternoon, hailing Mr. Trump for his “effective presidency” even as his shutdown strategy collapsed.David Winston, a Republican pollster, said the burden was now on Mr. Trump to restore his stature as a leader by forging some kind of border-security deal with Democrats, and to deliver a stronger message on the economy.“Leadership means results,” Mr. Winston said. “When you have a shutdown, people look at it, basically, as: the political system has failed.”ImageMr. Trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base, which makes up perhaps a third of the electorate.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesMr. Winston said polling data suggested the border wall had been a problematic fight to pick. “Immigration is an important issue,’’ he said, “but people are waking up every day trying to figure out how they’re going to pay a set of bills in front of them.”For now, Mr. Trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base, comprising perhaps a third of the electorate, despite private G.O.P. polling suggesting that his agenda on immigration has failed to move the country in his favor, Republicans who work closely with the president said.But Mr. Trump emerged from the shutdown with nothing to show for it, having angered swing voters with his intransigence, while disappointing hard-line supporters by failing to secure any funding for a border wall.[Read about President Trump’s retreat on the shutdown.]Conservatives still believe that Mr. Trump cannot afford to abandon his crusade for a barrier. Not long before Mr. Trump agreed to reopen the government, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a White House ally who leads the hard-line Freedom Caucus, argued that the wall fight was vital to the president’s re-election hopes.“It’s not lost on any of us that a central component of what he said when he ran in 2016 has to be addressed in a meaningful way,” he said in a recent interview.Privately, some of Mr. Trump’s 2016 aides have said they are pessimistic about his path to 270 electoral votes after his party’s midterm defeats in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. An Associated Press poll on Wednesday showed that Mr. Trump’s overall approval rating had fallen to 34 percent, with his support among Republicans dipping below 80 percent — a startling turn for a president who strives for total control of the G.O.P., and has usually achieved it.The Mueller investigation looms as another destabilizing force for the president. David Kochel, a Republican strategist based in Iowa who is opposed to Mr. Trump, said the special counsel’s eventual report could determine whether Mr. Trump is vulnerable in a primary.“That will be a focusing mechanism for the party,” Mr. Kochel said.While core Republican voters remain loyal to him and he is not currently facing a contest for the nomination, Mr. Trump’s low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some G.O.P. officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year.“I think it’s healthy and appropriate for the party to consider in 2020 whether this is really the path it wants to continue taking,” said David F. Holt, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, where a Democrat won a stunning House upset last year thanks in part to the suburban antipathy toward Mr. Trump.ImageGov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a popular centrist Republican who won re-election in November, has been courted to possibly run against Mr. Trump.CreditPatrick Semansky/Associated PressThe 2020 election is nearly two years away and Mr. Trump has ample time to build a political operation, marshal support from financial backers and make his case to the American people. Mr. Trump captured the presidency with a largely improvisational candidacy, guided by his own instincts for personal combat and cultural division, and lacking the strategic discipline of most presidential campaigns.But even among his own political lieutenants, there is a general recognition that Mr. Trump currently lacks anything resembling a positive message.Mr. Trump is especially fixated on two well-known Democrats, speaking frequently about Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president whom Mr. Trump regards as his most dangerous potential opponent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Some of his advisers are more preoccupied with two other would-be challengers, who would offer a starker generational contrast with the 72-year-old president: Senator Kamala Harris of California and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate.In this volatile moment, however, Mr. Trump and his aides have been just as focused on heading off competition from fellow Republicans. In addition to helping direct a resolution of support from the R.N.C. — Mr. Trump tweeted approvingly Saturday morning, suggesting re-election “should be easy’’ — Mr. Stepien, the former White House political director, has been leading an effort to ensure there is no insurrection at next year’s convention in Charlotte, N.C.Now a top aide on Mr. Trump’s campaign, Mr. Stepien and his deputies have been consulting party leaders about shutting off avenues to a challenge and ensuring that states cannot put forward “favorite son” candidates to contest the president’s renomination.Mr. Trump has also dedicated a team of aides to guaranteeing that only political loyalists are elected to serve as delegates to the convention. To that end, Mr. Stepien dispatched some of his staff members this month to see that their preferred candidate remained in charge of the Maine Republican Party.The fruits of some of those efforts were on display at the R.N.C. meeting outside Albuquerque, where enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was undimmed, at least publicly. The party leaders ignored Mr. Stone’s arrest, which took place just hours before they gathered, and Ronna McDaniel, the party chair, did not deviate from her prepared remarks, lashing the media for promoting “manufactured scandals.”Jeff Kent, the party committeeman from Washington State, offered perhaps the most ferocious tribute to the president, brandishing his red “Make America Great Again” hat as he addressed officials.“To the press in the back of the room,” said Mr. Kent, his voice rising, “please go tell the world we will always proudly wear this hat and we will always proudly support our great president, Donald A. Trump.” (The president’s middle initial is “J.”)ImageWhile core Republican voters remain loyal to Mr. Trump, his low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some G.O.P. officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York TimesOther Republicans view Mr. Trump’s political stumbles as an opportunity to lure a challenger into the race, with Mr. Hogan emerging as a new subject of their efforts. At a December conference hosted by the Niskanen Center, a right-of-center think tank, Mr. Hogan spoke briefly with William Kristol, an implacable Trump critic in the conservative press, who argued that the president is weaker than widely understood, people briefed on the conversation said.Mr. Hogan, 62, is set to meet more formally in the coming weeks with Mr. Kristol and Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist helping marshal opposition to Mr. Trump. Mr. Kristol and Ms. Longwell have been meeting with Republican donors and potential challengers, sharing focus-group and polling data about the president’s vulnerability with what they call “Reluctant Trump Voters,” according to a copy of their presentation reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Hogan is planning a trip to Iowa in his capacity as an officer of the National Governors Association. But his advisers also recently reached out to Mr. Kochel, the Iowa-based strategist, to ask that he put together a dinner with similarly minded Republicans while Mr. Hogan is there, according to an associate of Mr. Kochel briefed on the exchange.Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, said Mr. Hogan had “made it clear that the door is open to a potential candidacy, but no decision has been made.”In addition to Mr. Hogan, William F. Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, is weighing a challenge to Mr. Trump as a small-government moderate, people who have spoken with him said. Mr. Weld, 73, who was the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential nominee in 2016, has discussed either opposing Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries or seeking the Libertarian presidential nomination.Mr. Weld declined to comment on his deliberations, and Mr. Hogan declined through an aide to be interviewed.Other Republicans known to be entertaining campaigns against Mr. Trump include John R. Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, who ran in 2016; Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska; and Jeff Flake, the former senator from Arizona. But Mr. Sasse is said to have grown uneasy about the idea, and Mr. Kasich and Mr. Flake are pursuing opportunities in television.Bruce Berke, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire aligned with Mr. Kasich, said he currently saw Mr. Trump as unassailable in a G.O.P. primary.“A primary challenge in 2020, as of today, would be futile for anyone,” Mr. Berke said.Still, Republican donors will want to know just how damaged the president may be by the end of this year before they truly commit to a challenge.Asked if he would be willing to raise money for a primary opponent to Mr. Trump, Stanley Druckenmiller, a New York-based investor who has given millions to Republican candidates, said, “If I thought such a candidate would be a good president and had a realistic chance of securing the nomination, yes, of course.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Standoff Adds to Trump’s Vulnerability for 2020.

Prikhodko, a former deputy prime minister who was also onboard and is now deputy chief of the Russian government’s administrative apparatus. Mr. Deripaska has been under sanctions imposed by the United States along with other Russian magnates close to the Kremlin.Mr. Navalny said on his website Monday that leaked audio recordings showed that Mr. Deripaska, who had a business relationship with President Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, orchestrated the arrest of Ms. Vashukevich. She was first detained in Thailand last year and then seized by Russian police officers last Thursday at the airport in Moscow.Mr. Deripaska’s ties to Mr. Manafort, who has pleaded guilty to charges bought by the team of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have made the oligarch a bit character in various tangled story lines around the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential election.The surprise release on Tuesday of the detained Belarusian escort followed media reports that Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Ms. Vashukevich’s home country, had intervened on her behalf.Mr. Deripaska has stayed silent, saying only that he skipped this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an event he usually attends, to go fishing on Lake Baikal in Russia. Some interpreted that comment as a dig at Ms. Vashukevich, whose pseudonym, Rybka, means “little fish” in Russian.While in Thailand, Ms. Vashukevich claimed that she had audio recordings that could link Russia with Mr. Trump’s election, but no such recordings have come to light, and many doubt they exist.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Escort Linked to Oligarch Is Released.

Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Stephanie GoodmanJan. 27, 2019“Black Panther” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” were the big winners Sunday night at a SAG Awards ceremony that spread the bounty among several films and television shows.Chadwick Boseman, speaking for the “Black Panther” cast, which took the SAG equivalent of best picture, said that he was often asked if he expected the Marvel superhero film to be such a blockbuster. (It has earned $1.3 billion globally.) He said the Nina Simone song “To be Young, Gifted and Black” came to mind as he thought about the lack of diversity in most Hollywood films. “We know what it’s like to be told there’s not a screen for you to be featured on,” he continued. But “Black Panther,” he said, meant that “we could be full human beings in the roles that we were playing, that we could create a world that could exemplify a world we wanted to see.”“Mrs. Maisel” swept the comedy honors, including outstanding comedy series ensemble, and best comedy actress and actor for Rachel Brosnahan, who plays the title character, and Tony Shalhoub, who plays her father. “This Is Us,” the NBC melodrama, took best drama series ensemble.There were few overtly political moments Sunday evening, which more often focused on guild issues. Patricia Arquette, named best actress in a mini-series for “Escape at Dannemora,” thanked Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s 2016 election interference, as she left the stage. But she drew much more applause from fellow union members when she called out production companies that didn’t pay performers overtime.The SAG lifetime achievement award went to Alan Alda, 82, the veteran actor probably best known for the 1972-83 series “M*A*S*H.” In July, he revealed that he had been living with Parkinson’s disease for more than three years but that he had been leading a full life despite the movement disorder.After being introduced by Tom Hanks, who noted that the actor’s real name is Alphonso D’Abruzzo, Alda took the stage to a lengthy standing ovation from an audience that included his “M*A*S*H” co-star Mike Farrell. “It may never have been more urgent to see the world through another person’s eyes,” he said onstage, his hands trembling. “And when the culture is divided so sharply, actors can help, at least a little, just by doing what we do.”Here is the complete list of winners:MoviesOutstanding cast:

Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.ImageCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times1. President Trump agreed to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over border security, backing down after a monthlong standoff with Democrats over funding for his border wall.The decision paved the way for Congress to pass spending bills as soon as Friday. The stopgap measure will restore normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and begin paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work for free for 35 days.The plan includes no money for the wall and was essentially the same approach Mr. Trump rejected at the end of December. But he cautioned that the cease-fire might be only temporary.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. “If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.”Airport delays this morning added to the urgency of a solution. La Guardia Airport in New York was closed to arriving flights, and a shortage of air traffic controllers triggered significant delays across the Northeast._____ImageCreditLynne Sladky/Associated Press2. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, revealed the most direct link yet between the parallel efforts of the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid.In a seven-count indictment against Roger Stone, above, an informal adviser to President Trump, the special counsel disclosed evidence that a top campaign official had instructed Mr. Stone to get information from WikiLeaks about thousands of hacked Democratic emails. That effort began well after it was widely reported that Russian intelligence operatives were behind the hack.The indictment makes no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might hurt the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.Who is Roger Stone, anyway? Here’s what we know about him and his colorful career._____ImageCreditMeridith Kohut for The New York Times3. Venezuela’s opposition leader made his first public appearance since he declared himself president, and told supporters to keep pressure on the authorities “if they dare to kidnap me.”The rally was peaceful and there was no indication Juan Guaidó would be arrested, as many feared.At the same time, President Nicolás Maduro took a more conciliatory approach than before and called for dialogue. The request appeared to signal that the standoff between the government and Mr. Guaidó may be shifting.Opposition talks with the military may be a factor. Venezuela’s top brass swore allegiance to Mr. Maduro, but an opposition lawmaker said her colleagues were holding discreet talks with military leaders in hopes that they could build enough support to get large factions to switch sides._____ImageCreditBridget Bennett for The New York Times4. Jennifer Glover was assaulted by her fellow guards at a nuclear site in Nevada, she said.And instead of responding to her complaints, the government contractor she worked for eventually fired her.The encounter followed months of sexual harassment that she said began soon after she was hired. Even after reporting the abuse, she continued to face harassment and intimidation. She was reprimanded for calling out sick — to avoid her attackers, she said — and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluations.“Work went from being so exciting to being a nightmare,” she said._____ImageCreditPatrick Sison/Associated Press5. Mark Zuckerberg once vowed to keep WhatsApp and Instagram independent. Now he’s changing course to keep their users inside Facebook’s ecosystem.Facebook’s chief executive has mandated that the social network’s three messaging services — the third is Facebook Messenger — be knitted together. The three services will continue operating as stand-alone apps, but their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified.The changes also raise questions of data privacy because of how user information may be shared among the services. Today, WhatsApp allows people to sign up with only a phone number. By contrast, Facebook and Facebook Messenger ask for users’ real names.Separately, Amazon’s new facial recognition technology had more difficulty identifying the gender of female and darker-skinned faces than similar services from IBM and Microsoft._____ImageCreditChristof Stache/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images6. Can paid parental leave be too much of a good thing?The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is cutting its unusually generous paid leave in half — to six months — because yearlong leaves were impairing its work, it said. It is also adding a $20,000 stipend for new parents to spend on child care costs.The Gates Foundation’s experience highlights the challenges of devising effective family policies, especially in the U.S. — the only industrialized country not to offer paid leave.On top of questions about whether leave should be mandatory and who should pay for it, there has been little agreement on the right length of time. International evidence points to some answers: Around six months seems to be the magic number. And paid leave is not enough: Financial assistance for child care has a bigger effect on women’s ability to keep working._____ImageCreditBruce Omori/EPA, via Shutterstock7. It was nothing but a box of paperwork.In 1979, a Navy man credited with starting the quirky Hawaiian Iron Man Triathlon was reassigned to the mainland. He was looking for someone to run the third edition of the race — and handed off some papers to a couple who said they would do it.They went on to make the Ironman into an iconic test of endurance and one of the world’s premier sports brands. A Chinese conglomerate paid $650 million for it in 2015. Above, bikes awaiting their riders at the 2018 Ironman World Championship Triathlon.And because of that box, all these years later, the fight over who rightfully owns the race endures.Separately, have you noticed the N.B.A.’s scoring explosion this season? It has to do with the league’s emphasis on pace and 3-pointers, combined with an edict to make defenders back off._____ImageCreditIdris Solomon for The New York Times8. Roy Wood Jr. is best known as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.”But he has made a niche for himself as one of the country’s foremost comic voices on social issues — especially those affecting African-Americans.He almost didn’t make it this far: He grew up among gang members in Birmingham, Ala., and was arrested in his junior year of college for stolen credit cards. His probation officer encouraged him to keep doing comedy. Tonight, his first Comedy Central special premieres.In the special, Mr. Wood jokes that the national anthem controversy is especially absurd because the tune is based on a British song: “Now, you’re running around telling stolen people in a stolen land that they should stand for a stolen song?”And no matter how much time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you._____ImageCreditTamara Kenyon for The New York Times9. Ninety-nine percent of the U.S. population lives under light-polluted skies.After one math teacher from Washington, D.C., visited the country’s first International Dark Sky Reserve, 1,400 square miles in Idaho, he wondered how to make sure people know places like it existed.“A lot of people who live in an urban setting and who look like me will never get to see the beauty of our world in its natural state,” he told our graphic journalist.“There is no lock on the door. Nobody is trying to keep people of color out. But not having the opportunity to know about it, that’s a lock.”_____ImageCreditFrank Augstein/Associated Press10.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|It’ll Be a While Before Anyone Underestimates Nancy Pelosi AgainAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThe conversationIt’ll Be a While Before Anyone Underestimates Nancy Pelosi AgainA long while.By Gail Collins and Bret StephensMs. Collins and Mr. Stephens are Opinion columnists. They converse every other week.Jan. 29, 2019ImageHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the first day of the new Congress.CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesBret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I know you must be girding for the crushing defeat the Patriots will sustain this weekend.Gail Collins: My husband is from Boston and we have learned, from being a Patriots household in New York, what it means to be truly ostracized. There are probably more Republicans in our Upper West Side neighborhood than there are Patriots fans.I’m not normally a sports person. But Donald Trump has educated me in their big plus: Whenever things are terrible in the rest of the world, you can just talk with your friends, or neighbors or relatives, about who the best quarterback is. Or how the Mets will do this year. It’s a very unifying concept.Bret: And speaking of crushing defeats, that’s a fairly good description of what Trump has just sustained in his shutdown showdown with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. As a purely political matter, do you think he can recover?Gail: I’m almost finished writing a book on the history of older women in America, and it is really a treat to watch Nancy Pelosi wiping the floor with Donald Trump. I’d be happy to see any reasonably progressive, reasonably sane politician doing the job, but this particular saga really tickles me.Bret: This is a good moment to admit that I was totally mistaken about Pelosi. I thought her election as speaker would play into Trump’s hands, because he would lampoon her as the quintessential left-coast liberal elitist. Instead, she wasted no time cutting his, er, fingers off.Gail: Have you noticed that he’s terrible even at the things he was supposed to be good at during his cheesy reality show period, like making deals and firing people?He’s toast. Do you agree?Bret: Anyone who survives a half-dozen bankruptcies and goes on to win the presidency should never be written off.Gail: Sigh. Good point.Bret: Trump is a master of inventing new dramas to make us forget the old ones. And if unemployment and growth figures remain good a year from now, he’ll still have a powerful argument for a second term.That said, Trump’s hopes of being re-elected depend on his appeal to his base, and his base support is eroding. A poll from earlier this month has him down a net of 10 points with Republicans, down 13 with white evangelicals and down 18 with suburban men. If I were looking at those numbers as the head of the Republican National Committee, I’d be thinking that Trump would be wise to declare that he won’t run for re-election. Whether he would do that is, of course, another question entirely.Gail: Well, you’re presuming he has a life outside of this.Bret: Depends on his legal jeopardy, I guess.Gail: If the jeopardy level is high enough, he’d need to run again just because you can’t indict a sitting president. I for one do not want to imagine a 2020 campaign in which the base believes he’s a martyr who has to be saved from imprisonment.Bret: Maybe Bob Mueller can offer him immunity if he promises not to run. O.K., now I’m dreaming.Gail: We’re both trapped in an anti-Trumpian vortex where we agree about so much, but I know that deep down you’re a serious conservative, particularly on economic issues. So I want to ask about … oh God, Davos.Bret: God is of no use in Davos, Gail. Go on.Gail: Davos, as you may have heard, is an annual gathering in Switzerland where the economic and political elite come to have dinners and chat and pontificate. This year there were two things that interested me. One was that Anthony Scaramucci was there. This is the guy who lasted 11 days as White House communications director, appeared as a contestant on “Celebrity Big Brother” and then vanished from the series to reappear at Davos.I truly believe that reality TV is a thermometer of our cultural mind-set. Maybe the Mooch connection is proof that Davos is indeed a magnet for the best and the brightest.Bret: My long-held view of Davos is that nothing good that happens there is real, and nothing real that happens there is good. The Mooch’s presence this year proves both those points. Go on.Gail: One big topic was what happens to working people when automation takes over the world. Don’t care so much what the Davosians thought as I do about your opinion. You wrote a really powerful column the other day about socialism ruining Venezuela. But I don’t see how capitalism survives a techno-boom where automation puts half the population out of work. Thoughts?Bret: I’m not too worried. Capitalism survived the transition from horse-and-buggy to the Model T. It survived the transition from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing economy to a service-based one. And it survived the creative destruction of countless other forms of employment. Where, for instance, are the typesetters these days?Gail: Well, they’re not creating hot new social media sites.Bret: Now the question everyone is asking is what will happen to all those truck and cab and Uber drivers — a total of three million professional drivers — once driverless cars become ubiquitous. There’s no doubt the transition will be painful for some of them, and policymakers need to be sensitive on that point. But if history is any guide, things will work out. Many of those drivers will find work in industries that currently don’t exist. Just ask yourself, where was the mobile apps economy at the turn of the century? Where was the internet economy in 1990, or the personal computing industry in 1975?Gail: I still don’t see the truck drivers working on mobile apps. And if you’re worried about the left’s solutions, I don’t see a whole lot of candidates running around talking about the state taking over the means of production.Bret: Just wait an election cycle or two.Gail: But if we’re moving to an economy in which trucks are automated, robots do all the warehouse work and some kind of artificial intelligence is taking orders at the restaurant, we’ll need a government that can create a whole lot of useful public service employment to make up the difference.Bret: Heaven forfend.Gail: And underwrite free college education for everybody who needs it.Bret: No!Gail: And assure lower-middle-class people decent housing.Bret: My soul is dying.Gail: All of which would have to be paid for by large taxes on the very rich.Bret: Now it’s dead.Gail: That’s one area where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez makes a lot of sense.Bret: And buried.Gail: I love it when we have a real argument.Bret: You know, I was going to change the topic to Roger Stone, where we’d be nodding our heads in unison. But let’s explore our disagreements a bit more.Gail: Yeah, I suspect we are in accord about Roger Stone, career political con man and threatener of small, fluffy service dogs. So back to good government …Bret: I’m all for universities figuring out ways to become more affordable for those who need and deserve it, but making college free for everybody makes it bad for everybody. We would wreck a university system that’s still the envy of the world.Gail: Ahem. I believe I said free college for everybody who needs it. And happy to have vigorous government oversight. Employing talented Americans tossed out of their old jobs by robot accountants.But continue with your verbal shudder …Bret: As for affordable housing, I’d sooner trust the invisible hand of the market than the heavy hand of the state. Large taxes on the very rich won’t raise the kind of income you need, and sooner rather than later those taxes will land on the decidedly less rich. And A.O.C. should start mastering her facts rather than getting into Twitter wars with fact checkers.Gail: Hehehe. Knew I’d get you with A.O.C. That’s what people love about her.The weather is lousy, Bret, but I’m seeing a little bit of sunshine. The government’s running, for the moment. Nancy Pelosi knocked down Donald Trump’s wall plans. Roger Stone is indicted and the Mueller investigation is chugging right along. Now let’s raise some taxes and build some bridges.Bret: I was with you until you mentioned taxes. Purely theoretical question for you (and our readers) for our next conversation: If Congress would agree to cut the top marginal rate to 33 percent in exchange for a pledge by Trump not to run again, would you take it? I’m sure we’ll be hearing from readers on the comments page.Gail: Can’t wait to take this up.Bret: In the meantime, go Rams.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Gail Collins is an Op-Ed columnist, a former member of the editorial board and was the first woman to serve as Times editorial page editor, from 2001 to 2007.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Why Trump Still Likes RudyAdvertisementOpinionSupported byWhy Trump Still Likes RudyHard to imagine the attraction, but …By Gail CollinsOpinion ColumnistJan. 23, 2019ImageRudy Giuliani, a little off balance, at the White House in May.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThere are a lot of theories about why Rudy Giuliani is still Donald Trump’s lawyer. Maybe his crazed, contradictory rantings are a canny plot to confuse the public about what’s actually going on with the president’s Russia-connection scandal.Or maybe the fact that Giuliani works for free is more attractive than the fact that he does a dreadful job.Or maybe it’s just that he is the one person who makes Trump look good.Sure, both of them contradict themselves every five minutes. But Trump never tries to argue that he can’t be wrong because he’s such a great lawyer.Both men have been married three times, with a messy history when it comes to adultery, but Trump seems to have calmed down with age. Giuliani is 74, and he’s involved in divorce proceedings with his last wife, Judith Nathan, who claims very vigorously that he’s been running around.“For a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse, he has become a different man,” Nathan told New York magazine.People wondered whether the “nurse” thing was a reference to the fact that Rudy likes to drink. He also smokes — Nathan claimed that her almost-ex had spent about $12,000 over five months in cigars alone.Trump doesn’t use alcohol or tobacco. See, he’s looking better. Sort of.Other presidents who’ve gotten in trouble have hired private lawyers, but has there ever been anything quite like this? On Sunday Giuliani quoted his own client as saying that discussions with the Russians over a Trump Moscow hotel were “going on from the day I announced to the day I won.” Take it easy, Mueller investigators. Rudy seems to be doing your job for you.Then — retraction time! On Monday Giuliani said everything he told reporters on Sunday was “hypothetical.” And anyway, nothing matters as long as you can’t be convicted for it. (“My client didn’t do it, and even if he did it, it’s not a crime.”) The man is certainly a master of the low bar. “Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying $130,000 to the other one is not a crime,” he said during Trump’s shut-up-the-squeezes period.We pause here to briefly note that the Stormy Daniels payoff was delivered by Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Does this president have great taste in lawyers or what?Watch Giuliani on TV and you see a man being devoured by egomania. Lawyers are supposed to serve as a screen between their clients and the outside world. If said client is being accused of a crime, their mission is to make the whole matter sound as boring as humanly possible.It’s no problem for us that Trump picked an attorney who’s so wildly hungry for attention that he can’t follow the rules. Really, it’s great that we’re getting to hear so much unfiltered information. The depressing part is that this is just one more piece of evidence that Donald Trump surrounds himself with people who have both terrible judgment and terrible aptitude for the jobs they’re supposed to be doing.Whatever shred of credibility Giuliani still retains is connected to his role as mayor on Sept. 11, when the whole world saw him walking through the dust of the World Trade Center collapse. He needed to get uptown since the city’s emergency management center had been destroyed by the attack. That’s because Giuliani had it located in the W.T.C. — a place that had been targeted for bombing by terrorists in the past — despite vigorous objections from his security advisers. He just sort of wanted it close to City Hall.Later, the mayor would take dignitaries to the disaster site, sometimes shielded from the deadly asbestos floating through the air by a face mask. And, it appeared, totally ignoring the fact that most of the workmen had no protection whatsoever.Giuliani had already begun to evolve from competent city official to hapless big-time political candidate before the attack occurred. He tried to run for Senate against Hillary Clinton in what was undoubtedly one of the most disaster-ridden campaigns in history. That was the time he held a news conference to announce he was leaving his wife, without mentioning the matter to the spouse in question.His unharnessed libido has been part of his story ever since. Last summer, after Giuliani bragged to a reporter about his new girlfriend, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was forced to declare that she was “not today or tomorrow or at any point ever going to comment on Rudy Giuliani’s love life.”And the beat goes on. During his parade of super-strange comments over the last week, he volunteered that he’s afraid “it will be on my gravestone: ‘Rudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump.’”“Somehow I don’t think that will be it,” he added. “But if it is, so what do I care? I’ll be dead.”Once again we ask ourselves: What kind of a lawyer says stuff like that? What we have here is not a skilled strategist trying to find the best way to defend his client, but just another member of the nation’s ever-growing pack of celebrities who can’t shut up.Another one of them, of course, got himself elected president. At least Rudy doesn’t tweet as much.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Gail Collins is an Op-Ed columnist, a former member of the editorial board and was the first woman to serve as Times editorial page editor, from 2001 to 2007.

SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexSubscribeLog InLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|Three Impeachment OptionsAdvertisementOpinionSupported byThree Impeachment OptionsAnd why I think two of them are misplaced.By David LeonhardtOpinion ColumnistJan. 23, 2019ImageA protester holds a sign during the third annual Women’s March in Washington on Saturday.CreditCreditDamon Winter/The New York TimesThis article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.“The talk of impeachment, all-but-taboo in Big Media’s coverage of Trump, [has] moved from the margins into the mainstream — across the journalism spectrum,” wrote Margaret Sullivan, The Washington Post’s media critic, in her latest column. The topic was even part of this week’s episode of “Fox News Sunday,” as Sullivan pointed out.Her column focused on three recent articles about impeachment: a cover story in The Atlantic, by Yoni Appelbaum, called, “Impeach Trump Now”; my column from earlier this month, making the case for Trump’s removal as soon as possible; and Michael Tomasky’s recent Times Op-Ed, arguing that the best outcome would be Trump’s defeat in 2020.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]Together, those pieces lay out what are the three basic options for House Democrats:1. Wait, and beat him. That’s the case Tomasky makes. “While impeachment is clearly a valid exercise of power, so is another method of removal, also prescribed by the Constitution: an election,” he writes. Beating Trump in 2020, Tomasky explains, would have more legitimacy among his supporters and also “do more long-term damage to the Republican Party.”2. Impeachment now. The House of Representatives, Appelbaum writes, “must immediately open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, and bring the debate out of the court of public opinion and into Congress, where it belongs.” He argues that impeachment will increase the chances that Republicans eventually abandon Trump, by focusing attention on his misdeeds.3. Wait, because it increases the chances of removal. This third option — the one I prefer and that Democratic leaders seem to be pursuing — falls in between the two others.I’m not comfortable with Tomasky’s idea of waiting until 2020 (although I agree with him about the benefits of doing so), because I think it ignores all the potential damage Trump could do over the next two years as president.And I’m not persuaded by Appelbaum’s case that the start of impeachment hearings will sway Republicans. Given the current political polarization, I think impeachment is more likely to unite Republicans behind Trump. The process will inevitably focus the public on the actions of House Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. Faced with a choice between Team Trump and Team Pelosi, Republican voters and senators would choose the president.Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, and Joshua Matz also make this argument in a forthcoming epilogue to the paperback edition of “To End a Presidency,” their book about impeachment:“The president wins — and everyone else loses — when the main framework for evaluating his conduct is whether it will trigger impeachment. By battling on that terrain, [Trump] preemptively sets aside most standards by which a democracy should judge its leader. He also invigorates his base by turning every dispute into a referendum on his continued tenure in office.”I think that House Democrats should instead hold a series of hearings to uncover and highlight Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional behavior, especially his corruption, shady business practices and violation of campaign-finance law. Hearings like those — combined, at some point, with more findings from Robert Mueller — seem like they would have the best chance of cutting into Trump’s support from Republican voters and ultimately members of Congress. If that happens, impeachment would have a better chance at success.But I encourage you to read both the Appelbaum and Tomasky pieces. Each does a nice job of laying out its case. Another Merrick Garland decisionYesterday’s Supreme Court order against transgender troops in the military joins the list of cases likely decided by Senate Republicans’ refusal to let President Barack Obama fill a court vacancy in 2016. They ignored Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, and instead held the seat open. President Trump filled it in 2017 with Neil Gorsuch.Yesterday’s order was another 5-4 vote, with all the Republican-appointed justices in the majority and all the Democrat-appointed justices in the minority. The order allows the Trump administration’s ban on transgender troops to go into effect temporarily, while lower courts consider challenges to the policy.Every time one of these 5-4 votes occurs — along partisan lines — it’s worth remembering that the Garland stonewall likely determined the outcome.Russell BakerI grew up reading Russell Baker, both his columns on the Times Op-Ed page and his memoir, “Growing Up.” He was one of the giants of 20th century journalism and probably the wittiest of those giants.

Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said he has been falsely accused and “will plead not guilty.” He also called the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, “politically motivated.”CreditCreditCristobal Herrera/EPA, via ShutterstockJan. 25, 2019Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, was arrested by the F.B.I. early Friday morning at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.His indictment comes as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.[Read more about the arrest and the charges.]Mr. Stone appeared outside a federal courthouse hours later. The following is a transcript, as prepared by The New York Times, of his remarks and those of his lawyer, Bruce Rogow._____________[Crowd shouting expletives] MR. ROGOW: Whoa, whoa. Mr. Stone is going to speak. He speaks for himself. You know that Roger Stone has always spoken for himself. He’s never been shy about telling his story. He is innocent. We’re going to defend this case, and we’re going to win this case.But let me start out by saying that the spectacle this morning was completely unnecessary. Everyone knows where Roger Stone is; he’s not in hiding. The spectacle this morning with the SWAT team breaking into his house, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs, completely unnecessary. A telephone call would have done the job, and Mr. Stone would have appeared.But let me let Roger speak for himself. There’s nothing to hide. He has nothing to hide, and he’s spoken before and he’ll speak to you now. Roger?[SPECTATOR: We stand with you, Roger!]MR. STONE: Thank you.[Crowd booing] MR. STONE: Thank you very much. As I have always said, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. After a two-year inquisition, the charges today relate in no way to Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal act in connection with the 2016 campaign.I am falsely accused of making false statements during my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. That is incorrect.[Crowd: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!]Any error I made in my testimony would be both immaterial and without intent. I find it disturbing that the special counsel’s office released a press release prior to informing my attorneys that I would be charged today.[Crowd: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!]This morning at the crack of dawn, 29 F.B.I. agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with their lights flashing, when they could simply have contacted my attorneys and I would have been more than willing to surrender voluntarily.They terrorized my wife, my dogs. I was taken to the F.B.I. facility, although I must say the F.B.I. agents were extraordinarily courteous. I will plead not guilty to these charges. I will defeat them in court. I believe this is a politically motivated investigation.I am troubled by the political motivations of the prosecutors, and as I have said previously, there is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself. I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.REPORTER: [Inaudible] you in any way cooperate with the special counsel’s office?MR. STONE: Since I was not contacted prior to the charges today, my lawyers have not talked to the special prosecutors. I don’t want to address that question, but I have made it clear I will not testify against the president. Because I would have to bear false witness against him.[Crowd shouting]REPORTER: But will you work with the prosecutors?MR. STONE: I will be appearing for an arraignment in D.C. next week, and I’ll address those questions at that time.REPORTER: Roger, the president said that you had done [inaudible]. What do you think he meant by that?MR. STONE: Well, I intend to tell the truth. I have told the truth throughout this entire proceeding, and I will prove that in a court of law.REPORTER: How strong is your allegiance to President Trump?REPORTER: Are you going to ask the president for a pardon?MR. STONE: I am one of his oldest friends. I am a fervent supporter of the president. I think he is doing a great job of making America great again.REPORTER: Roger, did anyone tell you to contact, in the Trump campaign, to contact WikiLeaks?MR. STONE: Uh, no. I have addressed that before. That is incorrect.[Crowd shouting]REPORTER: If you were convicted, do you think the president would pardon you?MR. STONE: Pardon me?REPORTER: If you were convicted, do you think the president would pardon you?MR. STONE: The only person I have advocated a pardon for is Marcus Garvey.REPORTER: Did you in any way work with the Russians to help President Trump?MR. STONE: No. Categorically not, no. Absolutely not.[SPECTATOR: We got you, Roger! We got your back, Roger!]REPORTER: And the special prosecutor here is gathering evidence, he has this indictment. Would you in any way ––MR. STONE: With all due respect, I haven’t even had a chance to read the indictment.REPORTER: You haven’t even read the indictment ––MR. STONE: Correct. My attorneys have. I have not had that opportunity.REPORTER: So will you, will you help the prosecutor to answer his questions?MR. STONE: I will address those questions next week in Washington, D.C. Thank you.[REPORTER: Roger, if you did nothing wrong, what are you doing here?]Related CoverageRoger Stone’s Dirty Tricks Put Him Where He’s Always Wanted to Be: Center StageJan. 25, 2019ImageIndicting Roger Stone, Mueller Shows Link Between Trump Campaign and WikiLeaksJan. 25, 2019ImageHere’s What We Learned From Roger Stone’s IndictmentJan. 25, 2019ImageAdvertisementOpen in the appSite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingslistings & moreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountnewshome pageworldU.S.politicsNew Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshottoday's papercorrectionsopiniontoday's opinionop-ed columnistseditorialsop-ed Contributorsletterssunday reviewvideo: opinionartstoday's artsart & designbooksdancemoviesmusicPop Culturetelevisiontheaterwatchingvideo: artslivingautomobilescrosswordfoodCookingeducationstylehealthjobsmagazinereal estatet magazinetravelweddingsmoreReader CenterWirecutterLive EventsThe Learning Networktools & servicesN.Y.C. events guidemultimediaphotographyvideoNewslettersNYT storetimes journeysmanage my accountSubscribehome deliverydigital subscriptionsCrosswordCookingemail newsletterscorporate subscriptionseducation ratemobile applicationsreplica editionSite Information Navigation© 2019 The New York Times CompanyContact UsWork with usAdvertiseYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpHelpSubscriptionsThe Story of Roger Stone and WikiLeaks - The New York Times

This is The Daily. Today: The special counsel’s indictment of Roger Stone contains details as over-the-top as Stone himself, including encouraging an associate to use a tactic straight from “The Godfather” films. But the indictment itself is quite serious in finally making a link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. It’s Monday, January 28. [POUNDING ON DOOR]archived recordingF.B.I.! Open the door!archived recording (roger stone)Twenty-nine F.B.I. agents showed up at my home, pounded on the door. [POUNDING ON DOOR]archived recordingF.B.I.!archived recording (roger stone)I opened the door to pointed automatic weapons. I was handcuffed. There were —archived recordingWe have some major breaking news in the Mueller investigation. Roger Stone — you see him right there — President Trump’s longtime political adviser, former campaign aide, has been arrested in Florida. Charged with seven federal felonies, obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of making false statements and one count of witness tampering.archived recording (sarah huckabee sanders)This has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the White House, and beyond that, I’m not going to get into the back and forth.archived recordingHave you spoken to the president?archived recording (roger stone)There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself. I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.michael barbaroSo, Mark Mazzetti, what do we need to know about who Roger Stone is?mark mazzettiRoger Stone is a legendary Republican operative who, from the earliest days of his career, has plied the dark arts of scandal-mongering and dirty tricks in aid of political campaigns.archived recordingAre you telling me that that was a lie? Roger Stone is a trickster. Roger Stone is a shady character, O.K.? I know Roger Stone, and you know, he worked for Nixon. He famously tattooed his hero on his back. And who among us can say that? The questionable consultant’s resume is filled with work for Republican stars — Nixon, Reagan, Bush senior.mark mazzettiHe is someone who very proudly talks about how he tries to plant stories with the press, someone who tries to dig up any kind of personal dirt about a candidate in order to help the other side.archived recording (roger stone)I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against bull-bull-[BLEEP]-ing-ing and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. I’m sure it’s driving the Democrats crazy, but there’s nothing illegal about it.mark mazzettiSo this is someone who — well, for many people who hate politics, they would hate someone like Roger Stone.archived recording (roger stone)The truth is, Jimmy Carter’s middle name was not Hussein. A very substantial number of people wonder, because of the policies of this administration, about whether the president is a Muslim. This is not going to hurt Trump, and it’s not going to hurt Carson.archived recordingThey may wonder, but should a presidential candidate like Trump be saying that, or at least condoning it with his silence?archived recording (roger stone)I don’t think he commented either way.mark mazzettiHe goes on television in strange outfits, he gives interviews from his pool and clearly, in many cases, doesn’t take himself too seriously.michael barbaroSo he’s kind of a sideshow.mark mazzettiExcept he’s someone who Donald Trump has taken seriously for a long time.archived recording (roger stone)He’s a regular guy. You can talk to him like a regular person. There’s nothing formal or stilted about him, and he’s funny. He’s got a great self-deprecating wit. He’s just fun to be with.mark mazzettiHe’s been this sort of informal adviser to Trump over decades, and someone who, long, long before anyone took seriously the idea of Donald Trump being the president of the United States, Roger Stone was pushing this idea.archived recording (roger stone)It was not until 1987, really, late ‘87, that I began thinking about him as a presidential candidate.mark mazzettiAlthough it has often been a contentious relationship.archived recording (roger stone)Yeah, I think we have a complicated relationship. But first of all, recognize, I’m a Trump loyalist. Even when he’s wrong, I’ll be there.mark mazzettiThey’ve been at odds at times. He’s someone who didn’t last very long on the Trump campaign. He started out as an official campaign adviser, but was fired from the campaign pretty quickly.archived recordingAnd more turmoil for Trump — a top longtime associate both from his business world and in the political realm, Roger Stone is out tonight. Dispute about whether he resigned or was fired. Trump’s campaign says Stone was fired because he was using the campaign to seek publicity for himself.archived recording (roger stone)I have no interest in going back. Although I strongly support Trump, we have managerial differences. And meanwhile, I’m just making the very best case for him in public that I can, because I do think he has what it takes.michael barbaroAnd insofar as he was involved in the campaign, what exactly was his role as an informal adviser? What did that amount to?mark mazzettiHe was the classic late-night phone call person to listen to what Trump was thinking. He was the confidant of then-candidate Trump, talking to him by phone, being a sort of back channel of advice outside official campaign communications. You didn’t always know that Roger Stone was there, because he did have this behind-the-scenes role. But it was pretty apparent to people close to Trump that Roger Stone had this outsized influence over Trump.archived recordingIt seems to me there’s more than meets the eye here with Roger Stone parting company from the Trump campaign, coming on my program and others and giving the big Trump pitch.archived recording (roger stone)You media types are so conspiratorial. [LAUGHTER]archived recordingNo, no, the Stone-Trump types I think are the conspiratorial.archived recording (roger stone)I’m like —mark mazzettiSo he was behind the scenes until he wasn’t. In August of 2016, a few months before the election, Roger Stone sent a very cryptic tweet about Podesta.archived recordingRoger Stone tweeted that it would soon be, quote, “Podesta’s time in the barrel.”mark mazzettiAnd he said it will soon be his time in the barrel. Now Podesta was John Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And no one really knew what that meant until a few months later in October. A few weeks before the election, he sent out another tweet. I think it said, “On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton is done. #WikiLeaks.”archived recordingRoger Stone writes, “Thursday, October 6, Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing. I stand by my prediction. #HandcuffsForHillary.”mark mazzettiAnd then —archived recordingWe need to talk about these hacked emails.mark mazzettiThe Podesta emails spill out a few days later.archived recordingWikiLeaks released more than 2,000 emails. They claim they came from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, and other staffers. The leak revealed transcripts from some of Clinton’s paid Wall Street speeches. This is the first time that we’re actually getting a look at these Wall Street speeches. What you see is that her own words really hit on her own perceived weaknesses, particularly around relatability and trust. You see why she really wasn’t in a hurry to release these, as it really highlights a lot of concerns that voters have about her.mark mazzettiAnd so this is again Roger Stone creating this image that he had a direct channel to WikiLeaks and knew what the information was going to be before it became public.michael barbaroRight. And if I remember correctly, one of those WikiLeaks dumps of emails was right around the time of the “Access Hollywood” tape being published.archived recording (john podesta)October 7, the “Access Hollywood” tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails into the public. One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.michael barbaroWhich was interesting timing.mark mazzettiWithin hours. And of course, that’s very fortuitous timing if you’re candidate Trump. Very quickly, a lot of the media started focusing on the Podesta emails rather than this explosive story about the “Access Hollywood” tape.michael barbaroSo at this point, justifiably, everyone is starting to wonder, does Roger Stone, this informal adviser to the president who is in touch with the campaign, does he have inside knowledge of what’s going on at WikiLeaks? Is he coordinating with this organization?mark mazzettiYes, and remember, Roger Stone has built a career on creating an image that he does have great access.archived recording (roger stone)I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation.mark mazzettiHe does have insight that others don’t.archived recording (roger stone)I think that Assange is going to be very influential in this election, because he’s going to be educating the American people about the Clintons.mark mazzettiOnce the Russia investigation heats up, though, he has to reverse course.archived recording (roger stone)I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure time of the WikiLeaks disclosures. Assange himself has said so. In fact, Assange has said in his own tweets and in interviews that Roger Stone never predicted anything that I hadn’t already said in public.mark mazzettiHe has to paint himself as someone who didn’t have that knowledge, who didn’t have any insight, because that was something that could potentially put him in real legal jeopardy.michael barbaroSo what do we learn from this indictment last week about what was really going on here?mark mazzettiSo what we learned on Friday is that Roger Stone in fact did have insights into what WikiLeaks was doing. He made extensive efforts to find out what Julian Assange was planning. And we find out that he was directed by people inside the campaign to go find out what WikiLeaks was doing. So we really, for the first time, have a sense that there was a link between WikiLeaks’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign’s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton. And that link was Roger Stone. And something else that should not be lost in all this is that all of this was happening months after it was first revealed that the Russian government was behind this operation to hack the Democratic servers and put the information out for WikiLeaks.michael barbaroAnd that’s significant because it’s one thing to be coordinating with WikiLeaks when no one quite knows how it got those internal Clinton emails. It’s another to be coordinating with WikiLeaks once it’s understood that the emails it’s disseminating were stolen by Russia. It seems to elevate this above wanting negative information about your opponent out in the world.mark mazzettiThat’s right. All of this was done while it was well known that the Russians were behind this operation.michael barbaroSo do we know who on the campaign was talking to Roger Stone and encouraging him to keep communicating with WikiLeaks and find out when their leaks would occur?mark mazzettiThat’s where it becomes really interesting. The Times reported a few months ago that Steve Bannon, who was the campaign chairman at the end, was in contact with Roger Stone about this. In early October, Stone writes Steve Bannon that WikiLeaks would release, quote, “a load every week going forward.” He separately writes to a supporter involved in the Trump campaign, quote, “spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.”michael barbaroFriend in London presumably meaning Julian Assange?mark mazzettiRight. But the Mueller indictment has a very tantalizing detail.michael barbaroWhat’s that?mark mazzettiThe indictment said that a senior campaign official, quote, was directed by someone to contact Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases. There’s a very odd use of the passive voice that you would not expect in an indictment written by lawyers with Ivy League educations. The indictment does not say who it was that directed the senior campaign official. Of course, it’s led to speculation that that person could only be Donald Trump. We don’t know.michael barbaroEverything you’re describing here about Roger Stone’s communications with the campaign and Roger Stone’s communications with WikiLeaks — it sounds quite nefarious, but I wonder if it is illegal. Is his communication with WikiLeaks what Roger Stone was indicted for?mark mazzettiNo. The charge is Stone lying to Congress about his interactions with WikiLeaks, trying to tamper with witness testimony and an overall charge of obstruction of justice. As for the witness tampering charge, that centers around Stone’s interactions with someone named Randy Credico, who is a longtime New York radio personality, on-again-off-again friend of Stone, and someone who did in fact seem to have direct connections to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. And what the indictment details is that Roger Stone had several communications with Credico, trying to make sure that Credico told the same story to the House that Roger Stone had told, and even suggesting that he should pull a, quote, “Frank Pentangeli” before the committee.archived recordingDid you serve on the capital regime, Peter Clemenza, under Vito Corleone, also known as “the godfather“?mark mazzettiAnd that is a reference to a character in “The Godfather 2” who is called before Congress to testify about the mob and all of a sudden gets amnesia.archived recordingI ask you again, sir, here and now, under oath, were you at any time a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone? I don’t know nothing about that! Oh. I was in the olive oil business with his father, but that was a long time ago. That’s all.michael barbaroAnd why isn’t Mueller going after Stone for anything other than the lying, for the actions he lied about?mark mazzettiIt’s hard to make a conspiracy case. The fact is that the emails appear to have been stolen before Roger Stone knew about them, so he didn’t seem to have participated in the theft. And he seemed to maybe be trafficking in information that was becoming public or was about to be public. And this is what his defenders and the president’s defenders have pointed out, that these are all crimes that happened after the fact. He is not being charged with something that’s at the bottom of this whole thing — collusion, conspiracy, et cetera. And this is what, of course, President Trump has fallen back on for some time.archived recordingThis is why this thing is so weird, strange. The crime is conspiracy to hack. Collusion is not a crime. It doesn’t exist. Now, conspiracy to defraud the government — you’re right. Conspiracy to hack, that is the crime. We don’t know whether — Now, did Donald Trump engage in a conspiracy to hack with the Russians? They’ve been going at it — the counterintelligence investigation came to the conclusion — no evidence.michael barbaroMark, it feels like time and time again, when it comes to the Mueller investigation, he and his prosecutors are charging people around the president with lying or tampering with a witness or doing something deceptive around their interactions with his own investigation, but not with actually colluding with Russia or coordinating with Russia or being involved in a conspiracy that involves Russia, which, of course, is what this investigation is really about. What do you make of that?mark mazzettiIf you want to look at it as a best-case scenario for President Trump, it’s that there’s no original crime here. There’s no collusion, there’s no conspiracy. They’ve been charged because they were just lying to Congress.archived recordingToday’s surprise guilty plea by Michael Cohen — Cohen said in federal court that he lied to Congress, he says, to support Mr. Trump’s timeline of a Moscow real estate deal.mark mazzettiLying to the F.B.I. Withholding evidence.archived recordingTonight, former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos admitting he lied to the F.B.I. about his contacts with someone the F.B.I. suspected of being a Russian operative to cover for President Trump.mark mazzettiBut the worst-case scenario is that they are lying to protect something big. They were so concerned about what’s at the bottom of this story that they had to lie to keep investigators from getting there. That’s been one of the enduring mysteries of this entire story. Was there a grand conspiracy, or does this all add up to small, individual acts, individual contacts with Russians, individual business deals gone bad that individual people were trying to lie to cover up their own role? The fact that we don’t know where Mueller is going and Mueller only reveals his strategy in individual indictments means that we’re still left with these kinds of questions.michael barbaroAnd in this latest indictment, we’ve learned that Roger Stone, who has not been taken very seriously all this time, now seems to represent something quite important in all of this.mark mazzettiYes. In many ways, Roger Stone was this kind of cartoonish figure. If this were a whodunit, he’d be the obvious suspect that a reader would have long ago dismissed because he’s too obvious. And yet, here’s Roger Stone being charged with very serious crimes. And for the first time, we see Mueller show his hand that there really was this direct link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. But I think the bigger point is the question of how directly the Trump campaign officials were working with the original source of the information, and that is the Russian government. WikiLeaks was a pass-through here. The Russian government, Russian hackers gave it to WikiLeaks to distribute. The real question at the end of the day is not the communications necessarily with WikiLeaks, but whether there was foreknowledge about what Russia was doing and any direct communication with the Russians about their campaign to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s political future.michael barbaroMark, thank you very much.mark mazzettiThank you.michael barbaroWe’ll be right back.archived recording (president trump)Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government. [APPLAUSE]michael barbaroOn Friday afternoon, just hours after the F.B.I. raid of Roger Stone’s home, President Trump walked into the Rose Garden of the White House and announced victoriously that he was temporarily ending the shutdown with no agreement from the Democrats to fund his border wall.archived recording (president trump)I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers and their amazing families —michael barbaroThe announcement came a day after two bills to reopen the government — one sponsored by Republicans, the other by Democrats — failed to pass in the Senate, and as frustration over the shutdown began to boil over in highly public and disruptive ways.archived recordingThey’re both clowns. Both sides should sit down and make it happen, including our president, including Pelosi. It’s ridiculous. It’s not fair. It’s not T.S.A.‘s fault that they’re not getting paid and stuff. It’s the government’s fault. So the government should get it together.michael barbaroBy Friday, so many air traffic controllers had called in sick that the Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights across the Northeast. Hundreds of workers at the IRS refused to show up for work, and the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, had released a public message to his employees.archived recording (christopher wray)Hi, everyone. We’re now five weeks and two missed paychecks into this mess, and I wanted to touch base with all of you again. Making some people stay home when they don’t want to and making others show up without pay — it’s mind-boggling, it’s short-sighted and it’s unfair. It takes a lot to get me angry, but I’m about as angry as I’ve been in a long, long time.michael barbaroUnity among congressional Republicans, which had held for a month, began to collapse, with Republican senators, including majority leader Mitch McConnell, telling Vice President Mike Pence that the president’s shutdown strategy was not working and needed to end immediately. In his speech, the president, who has made the $5.7 billion in funding for his wall a non-negotiable condition for ending the shutdown, and who repeatedly rejected Democratic proposals to reopen the government while negotiations continue, ultimately did just that, restoring government to normal function for the next three weeks and promising to quickly pay back federal workers who have missed paychecks since the shutdown began. But —archived recording (president trump)If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.michael barbaroDemocrats and Republicans will enter formal negotiations this week to see if they can find a compromise on border security funding and on what constitutes a wall, a definition that is evolving for the president himself.archived recording (president trump)We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea. We never did. We never proposed that. We never wanted that, because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They’re already there. They’ve been there for millions of years.michael barbaroThat change in language and the decision to reopen the government with no funding for the wall drew condemnation from conservatives like Ann Coulter, who many believe helped push the president into a shutdown in the first place. “Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush,” Coulter wrote on Twitter. “As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp to ever serve as president of the United States.” That’s it for The Daily.

Stone Jr. contains details as over the top as Mr. Stone himself, revealing, for instance, that he encouraged an associate to use a tactic straight from “The Godfather.” But the indictment — which shows the most direct link yet between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks — is wholly serious.On today’s episode:Mark Mazzetti, a Washington investigative correspondent for The New York Times.VideoRoger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, has been charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He was arrested in a pre-dawn F.B.I. raid in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and appeared in court on Friday.CreditCreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesBackground reading:According to the indictment, a top Trump campaign official “was directed” by an unidentified person to dispatch Mr. Stone to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails. Mr. Stone has tried to write himself into history since he worked on the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon. After his arrest by the F.B.I. on Friday, he found himself where he has always wanted to be: center stage.Here’s what we learned from the indictment and what it tells us about “collusion.”How Stone is Connected to WikiLeaks and President Trump

The Trump administration took steps against two international companies, one in China and one in Venezuela.The Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against the Chinese telecom firm Huawei, several subsidiaries and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, accusing the company of stealing trade secrets and Ms. Meng of helping banks evade sanctions on Iran.And the Treasury Department announced it would impose sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil monopoly, the most forceful challenge to the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.In a side note to the Justice Department’s announcement, the acting attorney general announced that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was nearing an end._____ImageCreditBryan Denton for The New York Times4.

During a discussion about President Trump’s border wall, he said Hispanics should work harder to assimilate: “They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that’s going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.”Among those objecting was the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which noted that “most U.S. Hispanics are born in the United States; English is their native language.” Mr. Brokaw apologized.Separately, according to tabloid reports, Jennifer Aniston should have given birth to some two dozen babies in the last few years.

How do you measure a show you were never really meant to see?Awkwardly, for starters. On Sunday night, the live television broadcast of “Rent” had to use footage from a recorded dress rehearsal after a lead actor broke his foot. Only the final 15 minutes or so were live. Much of the hit musical was disappointing, our critic writes, “but clearly there was love in this production, too.”We also took a second look at “My Fair Lady,” 10 months into its run in New York.With four replacement principals in place, the revival is nicely evolving with new stars, our theater critic says. It’s all the more satisfying “when a musical not only lives in the moment but also changes and grows over time,” he says._____ImageCreditKristian Hammerstad10.

Stone Jr., the longtime Trump adviser who was arrested on Friday after having been indicted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The opening sketch of this week’s episode, hosted by James McAvoy and featuring the musical guest Meek Mill, was a parody of the Fox News program “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Carlson was played by the “S.N.L.” cast member Alex Moffat, who explained, “I’m like if those shorts with the little whales on them came to life.”Moffat introduced his top story: “President Trump’s heroic end to the shutdown,” he said. “It did take him 35 days, but he was finally able to get no wall.” Interviewing another Fox News personality, Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), Moffat said, “I’m going to smugly ask a question that I already know the answer to, and a warning to our viewers, my voice will get very high.”Describing her stance on immigration, Strong said, “We have to take a Marie Kondo approach to cleaning up this country. If something doesn’t spark joy, throw it out. And you know what doesn’t spark joy in me? Guatemalans.”ImageKate McKinnon as Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary.CreditNBCMoffat also interviewed Wilbur Ross (Kate McKinnon), the commerce secretary, who earlier this week said he didn’t understand why furloughed government workers needed food assistance because they could just take out low-interest loans instead.An apologetic McKinnon said, “That was silly of me. I simply meant that there are other ways of getting money. Like, they could’ve liquidated some of their stocks or sold one of their paintings. I mean, even if they sold a lesser Picasso, that’s still going to get you through a week or two of yacht maintenance.”She added, “All I meant was that we all have to make sacrifices in times of hardship. For example, instead of going out to dinner, you could open a restaurant in your house. Or, for a period of time, you could have your horses attend public school. The small things add up.”Finally, Moffat brought out his last guest — “a man you look at and instantly think, I trust this guy” — Roger Stone, played by Martin in a pinstripe suit and his voice projected at maximum volume.“What a fun couple of days,” Martin proclaimed. “I’m loving the ride. Go Nixon!”Asking for pity from Carlson’s viewers, Martin said, “I’m just a poor, helpless old man. I’m 66. I’m almost as old as Sting.”ImageJames McAvoy hosted the show this week.CreditWill Heath/NBCSpeaking of his early-morning arrest, he said, “The whole experience was so harrowing that afterwards I could only manage one radio interview. And a speech from the steps of the courthouse. And two appearances on television. It’s horrible!”Then at the close of the sketch, Martin tweaked one of his best-known “S.N.L.” catchphrases: “Hey, I’m just a normal and straightforward guy,” he said.Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on President Trump’s agreement to reopen the federal government for three weeks.Jost:President Trump on Friday announced a deal to temporarily reopen the government for three weeks, while negotiations continue over border security. Three weeks. We’re basically treating our government like it’s a trial period for a Hulu subscription. It’s pretty clear that Trump has not figured out how to deal with Nancy Pelosi yet. Usually when a woman is giving him this much trouble, he just gives her 130 grand to shut up. During his speech from the Rose Garden ending the shutdown, Trump said this: [Video of President Trump saying, “We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shiny sea. We never did.”] Shiny sea? Also, remember when you said this? [Video of President Trump saying, “We’re going to build a wall. It’s going to be a big, fat, beautiful wall.”] Now that wall sounds awesome. But tell me more about this new one. [Video of President Trump saying, “The walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls.”] Walls with brains, got it. Now, someone told me that medieval solutions were actually effective. [Video of President Trump saying, “They say a wall is medieval. Well, so is a wheel. A wheel is older than a wall.”] He’s president. But just to clarify, we are still calling it a wall, right? [Video of President Trump saying, “Barriers, fences or walls. Or whatever you want to call it.”] Honestly at this point I’d just like to call it quits.Che:On Friday, President Trump temporarily reopened the government, and I know liberals are tweeting out, “Trump caved! Trump caved!” But y’all gotta calm down. Stop gloating. You didn’t win yet. The man is still one tweet away from calling a national state of emergency and bringing back slavery. Act like he’s still crazy. You’ve got to treat him like you’re training a dog. Constant positive reinforcement. Maybe instead, every time he does something you like, tweet out, “Who’s a good boy?”They also commented on the indictment and arrest of Roger Stone.Che:Roger Stone was arrested at 6 a.m. Friday morning by a team of officers with heavy weapons. Finally. This is all I’ve been waiting for. Old white dudes getting dragged out their crib like dope dealers. Was it excessive? Yes. And I wish it was worse. I wish he was just wearing boxers and a durag and there was a baby crying and they tased his girl. Give him the works.Jost:Longtime Trump adviser and business Babadook Roger Stone has been charged by the special counsel’s office on seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements, witness tampering and, I assume, the attempted murder of Batman. Stone, pictured here as an old woman being told there’s no more room at bingo, left the courtroom to face a crowd that was booing and chanting, “Lock him up.” First of all, it’s always fun to watch a press conference on mute where the captions say, “Crowd booing.” Second, you know how much people have to hate you for them to show up just to boo you in the middle of a workday? They found out you were arrested that morning, immediately called their office like, yeah, I’m going to be late. I’ve got to head down the courthouse and yell at steampunk Lincoln.Music Video of the WeekThere wasn’t anything political or topical about this segment, but Leslie Jones was charming in a hip-hop tribute to Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Though she has previously lived in neighborhoods like Compton, Spanish Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Jones pledged her devotion to the U.E.S., saying, “Y’all say it’s boring, y’all say it’s homogeneous, but y’all don’t know it like I do.”Then she went on to rap:This ain’t Harlem, y’all, I got Seamless for daysAnd a cab outside that comes right awayI order what I want, y’all can’t stop meTwo in the morning, bring me salmon and broccoliYou think there ain’t no black folks?

Sign up to get it by email.___The gridlock of the government shutdown in Washington has me thinking this week about money and government in Australia.In the United States at the moment, just paying government workers is an epic challenge; here’s the latest on failed attempts to end the impasse in Washington.In Australia, however, I’m often struck by the never-ending flurry of new funding announcements for so many things deemed vital by officials.Y’all are rich, as some Americans might say, and profligate — especially with an election on the way.Just this week, Scott Morrison proudly declared that Australia would spend more than A$12 million ($8.5 million) to mark the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook’s first voyage to Australia. That includes A$6.7 million for having a replica of Captain Cook’s ship, the Endeavour, circumnavigate Australia with stops at 39 locations.And that comes on top of big spending elsewhere.Money to memorialize the past (in glossy romanticized form) is plentiful. You probably heard about the A$500 million gift to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, to upgrade the monument with a bit of recent military history.But that’s on top of another A$100 million set aside for the Sir John Monash Centre in France, along with A$12.7m for official histories of Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor.The War Memorial windfall is the one drawing the most scrutiny; how the money will be spent is still something of a mystery. Lots of planes and tanks seems to be part of it.The rest? Well, good luck: Secrecy, it seems, is another common theme.Perhaps because this is year 27 of uninterrupted economic growth, public money is sometimes treated like a toy for political toddlers (the ferry-naming contest that briefly yielded Ferry McFerryface comes to mind) and demands for details tend to produce answers only after the cash is spent.This was also the week, for example, when the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced its first project since it received A$443 million from the government last year. That’s a giant pool of money. It was doled out at record speed, with barely any oversight and no competitive bidding.And the foundation’s first project — setting aside A$574,000 to finance a survey of remote parts of the Great Barrier Reef — has done little to douse the flames of outrage. It came on the heels of an audit that found the administration costs associated with the A$443 million grant could be as high as A$86.4 million.But it would be a mistake to look only at the winners.Even a wealthy country still has to make choices so to make sure I wasn’t overly distracted by all that generosity, I looked around a bit for what’s being cut.The first thing I noticed was the value of scrutinizing spending in context.Both the Liberal and Labor leadership scrambled this week to take credit for a A$60 million hospital expansion plan in Cairns, but that increase looks less impressive when you consider that the government — with Mr. Morrison as treasurer — shifted more of the health care burden to states in what Labor sometimes describes as a A$715 million cut for Australia’s public hospitals from 2017-2020.The second and more obvious thing that jumped out at me: cuts to higher education.This was already on my radar — many of our stories have examined Australia’s dependence on full-fee-paying foreign students — but the numbers are staggering.In December 2017, the federal government announced it would cut A$2.2bn from universities, mostly through a two-year freeze in grants funding.Then last month, universities were hit with another round of research funding cuts — A$328.5 million reduction over the next four years.Quality education is never just about money. And in comparison to higher education costs in many other countries, especially the United States, Australia is still a bargain for students.But when spending outlays and spending cuts are thrown together, you start to wonder: Is it fair to say that Australia’s government is choosing to spend money on a Disneyfied version of British settlement rather than on actual academic research?Perhaps not. The dollar amounts differ and there are all kinds of examples I’ve left out of my cursory analysis.And yet, the old journalistic adage borne of Watergate — you know the one, “follow the money” — still rings true in many ways and many places, including Australia.Yes, for my colleagues in Washington, that simple phrase has a different connotation. Right now it means covering how government workers are surviving without paychecks. It also conjures up images of Robert Mueller and his investigation into President Trump and Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In Australia too, though, it’s worth looking past the announcements promoting dollar signs and grants. If and when a recession does come, and there are signs that it’s around the corner, there will be a lot of questions to be answered about priorities.Now for a few reads of the week.P.S.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.For the first two years of his presidency, it seemed like Donald Trump could, as he famously put it during his campaign, shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose his voters.Republican majorities in the House and the Senate negotiated his agenda on Capitol Hill. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Paul Ryan protected him from serious Congressional investigations, and passed a sweeping tax bill, the president’s major legislative accomplishment. G.O.P. lawmakers largely lived in fear of angering the president’s still-loyal base if they challenged him.Times have certainly changed. Mr. Trump spent the Christmas holidays complaining that he was all alone in the White House. Now, with the government in the middle of its longest-ever shutdown, his State of the Union address has been delayed indefinitely. Even his G.O.P. armor shows some tiny cracks, with a half dozen Republican senators voting on Thursday afternoon in favor of a Democratic proposal to reopen the government.So far, divided government hasn’t been a good look for Mr. Trump. And a batch of new polls released over the past few days tells a pretty unflattering story for him.• His approval rating is at an all-time low: 36 percent in a CBS News poll, 40 percent in a Politico/Morning Consult poll and 34 percent in an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.• Perhaps, most importantly, his sales pitch on the border wall hasn’t succeeded. Only 22 percent of American voters, including 40 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents, consider the situation along the southern border an “emergency,” according to a Fox News poll.• Only about a third agreed that the wall would make the country safer, according to the A.P. poll. Not even a majority of Republicans supported Mr. Trump’s argument that a wall would reduce the availability of illegal drugs in the United States, the poll showed.• The CBS News poll showed that seventy-one percent of Americans, including 43 percent of Republicans, do not believe the wall is worth the federal shutdown. Two-thirds of respondents want him to agree to a budget without wall funding and 60 percent see the shutdown as causing “serious problems” for the country, according to the poll.It’s unclear whether these numbers will sway the president, who spent the morning tweeting out his case for the wall. He has a history of focusing on the polling numbers that reinforce what he wants to see and discrediting the rest as “fake news.” And while proposals float around the White House for a big deal on immigration, there are certainly some in his administration who still believe Democrats will cave on the wall.But the economic pain of the shutdown is real — and spreading. There’s a little bit of noise about a primary challenge to Mr. Trump, a rumbling that grew slightly louder last week after Gov. Larry Hogan, a Maryland Republican, used his inaugural address to raise the specter of impeachment. And while shutdowns don’t generally decide elections, Democrats see an opportunity to undermine the president’s image as a master deal maker, a key piece of his political identity, ahead of 2020.Keep in mind, this is all happening before the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller, delivers his findings on the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia. Depending what that investigation reveals, Mr. Trump could be in for a chilly spring.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it.

Huh/Associated PressHere at On Politics we spend a lot of time writing about the Betos, Bidens, Warrens and Sanders of the political world — the early possible stars of the 2020 Democratic primary cycle. But it takes a crowd to create a crowded field. Below those boldfaced names lurks a whole other world of presidential politics.We spoke to two men yesterday — Pete Buttigieg and former Representative John Delaney — who are definitely long shots but are hoping to have their moment on the national stage.They are probably little known beyond the world of political junkies; neither man is listed in early voting polls or has expansive lists of supporters. But both see little downside in taking their shot to become the leader of the free world.“A broad field, a wide-open field that’s a good thing for newcomers,” said Mr. Buttigieg.Wednesday was a big day for Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who announced his presidential exploratory committee at a Hyatt hotel in Washington, D.C. The location was telling: It was chosen because it would be close to the offices of political reporters and on the sidelines of a conference for American mayors.The youngest and only gay candidate in the race, Mr. Buttigieg, 37, believes his economic record in South Bend, his youth and his military service give him an edge in a crowded field.“I’m the only one who is living a middle class lifestyle in Middle America,” he told reporters. “I get the odds but I also believe we can do something that no one else can do.”Mr. Buttigieg cast his underdog status as an advantage, saying it would allow him to be bold, though he didn’t introduce any new plans during his announcement. His last moment on the national stage? A bid for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 that ended with Mr. Buttigieg dropping out of the race shortly before voting.Some of the questions he fielded this time around: What makes him unique? How does he stand out in a packed race? And how do you pronounce his name?Mr. Buttigieg’s official Twitter feed offered this pronunciation: BOOT-edge-edge. His husband, Chasten Buttigieg, offered some other options.Mr. Delaney, meanwhile, has been running for president for more than 18 months, after announcing his bid in an op-ed in the summer of 2017 — almost three and half years before the election. The former Maryland congressman told On Politics that he thinks he’s gaining traction in the race, citing his 20 visits to Iowa and his six campaign offices in the state.His pitch: He can bring Americans together because he’s “someone who’s not ashamed to say I’m more moderate.” That might be a tough sell in a party that’s tilted left, both on policy and tactics, during the Trump era.Still, Mr. Delaney sees a way to win. The fact that he’s able to self-fund some of his campaign makes it easier, too.“I think I break out on the ground in Iowa,” he said. “As people start figuring out the progress we’re making in Iowa I think it becomes very clear what our path is.”____________________What to read tonight• The shutdown could prompt government service to lose its allure, causing some civil servants to worry about a brain drain of scientists, researchers and other specialists.• No one likes traffic.

Seeks Distance From Russia as Investigations Heat UpImageN.R.A. donors, boosters and board members visited a Moscow hunting club during a 2015 trip organized by David Keene (pictured in a red vest), a former president of the group.By Danny HakimJan. 28, 2019When a delegation of high-profile donors, boosters and board members from the National Rifle Association traveled to Russia in 2015, they visited a gun factory in Moscow, took in a ballet and met with members of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.But now the N.R.A. is seeking to distance itself from the trip, after revelations that a Russian woman who helped arrange it, Maria Butina, was conspiring to infiltrate the organization.The trip has been a subject of scrutiny in at least four inquiries into the N.R.A.’s ties to Russia; questions about the N.R.A. have also surfaced in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Newly empowered congressional Democrats are now stepping up efforts to uncover how much money the N.R.A. received from Russia, and whether the group served as a conduit for Russian funds into the 2016 Trump campaign.The N.R.A.’s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, forbade staff members to join the delegation that went to Russia, according to the organization’s outside counsel, William A. Brewer III — “Wayne was opposed to the trip,” he said. The N.R.A.’s president at the time, Allan Cors, abandoned a plan to join the delegation, and the group refused to pay all of the related travel expenses, though it did cover some of them.“Wayne expressed concerns about this trip and suggested that I not participate,” Mr. Cors said in a statement released through the N.R.A. “Wayne did not want any misconception that this was an official trip. Frankly, I had similar concerns.”Given Mr. LaPierre’s power within the organization, it is unclear how such a trip would have proceeded at all despite his opposition to it.The trip was organized by David Keene, a former N.R.A. president who was close to Ms. Butina, and who had his own interests in Russia. An email between a member of the delegation and Paul Erickson, a Republican operative who is Ms. Butina’s boyfriend, suggests that Mr. Keene, who was then the opinion editor of The Washington Times, hoped to secure an interview with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, according to people familiar with the email. Mr. Keene also later explored a deal to import Russian gas with Ms. Butina’s help, though it never appeared close to fruition.ImageFrom left, Joseph Gregory, a major donor; Pete Brownell, the N.R.A.’s first vice president at the time; and Mr. Keene met with Dmitry Rogozin, then the deputy prime minister of Russia.Mr. Erickson’s lawyer, William H. Hurd, had no comment on the email, but noted that his client had not gone on the trip and said, “Anyone who thinks that a freedom-loving group like the N.R.A. is going to get all cozy with Vladimir Putin is living in Fantasyland.” A woman answering the phone at Mr. Keene’s home referred calls to the N.R.A.Also along for the Russia trip were Joseph R. Gregory, co-chairman of the N.R.A.’s Golden Ring of Freedom, a group for donors of $1 million or more; and Pete Brownell, then the organization’s first vice president, who would later become president.Congressional scrutiny of the N.R.A. has intensified since Ms. Butina pleaded guilty last month to conspiring to act as a foreign agent, in a deal with the United States attorney’s office in Washington. She admitted to being part of a Russian-backed effort to use the N.R.A. to influence American politics. Two Senate committees are also investigating the N.R.A.’s ties to Russia, as is the House Intelligence Committee, and the Federal Election Commission initiated a preliminary inquiry last year. Three past N.R.A. presidents — Mr. Keene, Mr. Cors and Mr. Brownell — have been asked for interviews in the inquiries.A critical question for investigators is the extent of the N.R.A.’s financial ties to Russia. While the N.R.A. has turned over thousands of pages of records in the Senate inquiries, those documents do not include the organization’s closely held donor records; it is possible, however, that federal investigators have obtained the organization’s tax records from the Internal Revenue Service.Responding to questions from the Senate Finance Committee, the N.R.A. said last year that since 2015 it had brought in roughly $2,500 “from people associated with Russian addresses” or Russian nationals living in the United States. But that left open the question of money that may have come from shell companies or other less overt sources.“The N.R.A. should provide the financial documents and other records necessary to explain the scope of their activities,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and the committee’s ranking member, said in a statement. “The prospect of N.R.A. or N.R.A. officials abusing nonprofit status to work with a hostile regime and undermine our democracy is central to my investigation.”The N.R.A.’s outside counsel, Mr. Brewer, said that after an internal review, the group “believes that no foreign money made its way into the organization for use in the 2016 presidential election.” Any suggestion that the group took in Russian money, he said, “fails to appreciate the steps the N.R.A. takes to guard against such an unwanted event.”With Democrats now controlling the House, an inquiry led by the House Intelligence Committee has new life.“We had begun to pursue this investigative thread at least a year ago, and were stymied by the then-majority,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who now leads the committee. “We were really not able to determine how the Russians used the N.R.A. as a back channel or look into allegations that the Russians may have funneled money through the N.R.A. to influence the election. Those issues remain of deep interest to us.”ImageMr. Keene, left, in 2014 with Jim Porter, the N.R.A. president at the time, and Maria Butina, a Russian national who last month pleaded guilty to trying to infiltrate the organization.Mr. Keene spent several years building ties with Russia. He befriended Aleksandr P. Torshin, a Russian politician close to Mr. Putin who worked closely with Ms. Butina. The trip was ostensibly an effort by Mr. Keene and Ms. Butina to link efforts to advance gun rights in Russia and the United States, and was partly funded by Right to Bear Arms, an organization Ms. Butina founded.Members of the N.R.A. met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as Dmitry Rogozin, who at the time was Russia’s deputy prime minister and was under sanction by the Obama administration for his role in the Russian occupation of Crimea. A number of photos were taken along the way, at locales that included a Moscow hunting club, and posted on social media.Like Mr. Keene, some others on the trip had an interest in Russia beyond the N.R.A. Jim Liberatore, chief executive of Outdoor Sportsman Group, which operates the Outdoor Channel and has financial ties to the N.R.A., had an idea for a reality show starring Mr. Putin. After meeting Ms. Butina on the trip, he hired her as a $5,000-a-month consultant to help pursue the show, though he gave up on it a few months later.Mr. Brownell had expanded his family-owned gun accessory retailer, Brownells, into Russia in 2015, before the trip, licensing its name to a local company and collecting a percentage of sales. Brownells has similar deals in more than a dozen other countries, a company spokesman said.After the N.R.A. declined to pay some of the trip’s costs, Mr. Brownell covered nearly $14,000 in travel expenses for another participant, the former Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke, Jr., public records show.The trip has not been the only recent subject of controversy for the N.R.A. There have been signs of financial strain, including reports that the organization cut perks like free coffee. Gun control groups outspent the N.R.A. in the 2018 election cycle, upending what had become the typical political order. The group is also locked in a legal battle with New York State, which barred it from offering insurance to gun owners involved in shootings, an important source of revenue for the organization.Mr. Brownell abruptly stepped down as president last year, halfway through the traditional tenure served by his predecessors, catching the organization off guard. Even his successor, Oliver North, could not hide his surprise.“I did not expect that this was going to be happening,” Mr. North told NRATV, the group’s online video channel.Mr. Brownell, for his part, said, “The position demands full-time attention today, where in the past it was honorific in nature.” He added, “I wanted to devote more attention to my family and to my growing business.”Susan Beachy contributed research.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with reaction to the possible peace deal in Afghanistan, U.S. charges against the Chinese company Huawei and an embarrassing iPhone bug.ImageAn American military post in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, last year.CreditJames Mackenzie/ReutersFears of what could follow an Afghan peace dealCurrent and former U.S. diplomats and military officials were cautiously optimistic on Monday about the framework for a deal to end the 17-year war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. But they questioned whether a power-sharing arrangement could be found, and what the effects might be on U.S. counterterrorism priorities.An intelligence assessment from 2017 said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the U.S. within two years. Aides have used the report to try to convince President Trump that a residual American force must remain in the country. Another angle: Afghan officials are worried the U.S. could try to reach a separate deal with the Taliban if that would allow American troops to leave.Voices: They were children when the war started. Now, two Times reporters from Afghanistan reflect on the possibility of peace. U.S. accuses Chinese tech giant of theftThe Justice Department unveiled charges against the telecommunications firm Huawei and its chief financial officer on Monday, outlining a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade sanctions on Iran.American officials said they would request the extradition of the executive, Meng Wanzhou, from Canada before a Wednesday deadline. Huawei said today that it was innocent of the charges, but neither the company nor the Chinese government has easy options for responding or retaliating.Why it matters: Officials have long suspected Huawei of working to advance Beijing’s global ambitions, and they have begun taking steps to curb the company’s international presence.What’s next: Top intelligence officials are to appear in Congress today to discuss the threats posed by Chinese cyberespionage and the role Huawei has played. The indictments on Monday could also complicate U.S.-China trade talks this week.

The panel’s first meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.The lawmakers have until Feb. 15 to reach a compromise over President Trump’s call for $5.7 billion for a wall. The president has said that without an agreement, he would use emergency powers to fund the wall. Yesterday: Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the 35-day government shutdown. The impasse cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of which is permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said.Looking ahead: Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address has been rescheduled for next Tuesday.If you have 24 minutes, this is worth itGambling and the future of sportsImageCreditPhoto illustration by Najeebah Al-Ghadban.

The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China’s industry and information technology ministry called them “unfair and immoral.”The allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington’s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Throwing a wrench into trade talks with ChinaThe Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been “significant movement” on talks that involved “very complicated issues,” including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices. Yesterday, the chip maker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in China.As Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division, notes:“The damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump’s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.”ImageA section of border wall being built in the U.S. near Tijuana, Mexico.CreditScott Olson/Getty ImagesThe aftershocks of the shutdownThe five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of it permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.That’s nearly double the $5.7 billion President Trump is seeking for a southern border wall — a project he still wants and is still threatening to shut down the government to get.The damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay, but with the government only funded for three weeks, many federal employees plan to hold off on spending.Here’s another wrinkle: Government statisticians just now returning to work are behind on collecting and analyzing figures on retail sales, manufacturing data, housing statistics and other information. Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz defends his plan to run as an independentHoward Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump’s chances for re-election.“Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,” Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the “guts” to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called “childish.” Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: “Don’t help elect Trump,” yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, “Health care is a human right.”More: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz’s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Ghosn’s plight reveals a pattern in JapanCarlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request. His predicament has turned a spotlight on the Japanese criminal justice system, writes the NYT’s Motoko Rich:The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.Some in the West have reacted strongly to the power that prosecutors have wielded. “This is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,” one critic wrote.Revolving DoorBlackBerry named Bryan Palma, a senior vice president at Cisco, as its chief operating officer and president.

You think that’s mean? No, it’s smart.”Other highlights from Mr. Stone’s activities in New York:1980: He helped run Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in New York and Connecticut. The Times called him “equally adept at cajoling or threatening.”1982: Mr. Stone’s 30th birthday party was hosted at the 21 Club in Midtown by Roy Cohn, Senator Joe McCarthy’s right hand man during the Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. (Among Mr. Cohn’s later clients: Donald Trump.)2000: Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump agreed to pay a $250,000 fine to the state and apologize for running newspaper ads under the name of a front group for Mr. Trump’s lobbying effort against casino interests in the Catskills.2007: Mr. Stone was forced to quit working for the New York State Senate leader Joseph Bruno after he was accused of making a threatening phone call to the ailing father of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. (Mr. Stone denied it to me and told me he was getting a tattoo of Richard Nixon’s face on his back during the time of the alleged call.)2008: Mr. Stone took credit for unearthing evidence that drove Mr. Spitzer from office, which Mr. Stone said he obtained from a prostitute at a sex club in Florida.2010: Mr. Stone advised the campaign for governor of Kristin M. Davis, the former madam who claimed to have supplied prostitutes to Mr. Spitzer.ImageMr. Stone at Trump Tower in December 2016.CreditAndrew Harnik/Associated PressTonight: Annual count of city’s homelessThe Times’s Nikita Stewart reports:One night a year, hundreds of volunteers fan out onto New York’s streets to count the number of people sleeping on sidewalks, living in encampments in parks or calling the subway home.This year’s annual Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, known as the HOPE count, happens from 10 p.m. tonight until 4 a.m. tomorrow. About 3,500 people have signed up to help count, the city Department of Homeless Services said.The survey is mandated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to estimate how many homeless people are living sheltered and unsheltered nationwide, which determines federal funding.Last January, an estimated 78,676 homeless people lived in New York City, the most of any city in the country, according to HUD data.To keep counters on their toes,
paid decoys will roam the streets in what is known as the Shadow Count. The more of them that volunteers find during the HOPE count, the more accurate it is supposed to be.Best of The TimesImageCreditLily Landes for The New York TimesCop-turned-author-turned police official: Edward Conlon, a retired city detective and the author of the best-seller “Blue Blood,” is now the director of executive communications for the city’s police commissioner.No safe haven: An Islamic enclave near the Catstkills has repeatedly been targeted by online conspiracy theories.Armani redecorates: The redesign of its Madison Avenue store to include branded apartments above shows how the luxury market is turning from goods toward experiences.Ode to paper playbills: An arts journalist says digital playbills just aren’t the same.Paths to power: An interactive map shows how each member of Congress got to office.Football player accused of punching N.Y.P.D. sergeant: Some believe the police union’s response was racist.[Want more news from New York and around the region?

The explosive report says the president personally instructed his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress to hide the president’s involvement in a real estate deal for a Moscow Trump Tower. BuzzFeed cites two law enforcement officials who say Mueller has evidence that the president personally instructed Cohen to lie. The story’s most explosive and consequential claim is this — that according to BuzzFeed sources, the special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages and a cache of other documents. It’s the most direct allegation yet that President Trump may have committed a crime.michael barbaroMike, what were you thinking when that BuzzFeed report first came out earlier this month?michael schmidtMy first thought was, damn, that’s a really good story. And it particularly hurt because I have spent much of the past two years focused on the issue of obstruction of justice.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtAnd this was the clearest case to date that showed the president may have obstructed justice. It was the president telling one of his associates to lie.archived recordingIf true, this would be bigger than Watergate. If true, this would be obstruction of justice. Well, the revelation is prompting Democrats to say impeachment is a possibility if the reports are true. If, if, if, if true — Then we are likely on our way to possible impeachment proceedings.michael schmidtImmediately there was a lot of pressure on us to match this story.archived recordingSo far we have not been able to confirm BuzzFeed’s report.michael schmidtAnd we spent much of the day trying to suss out what was going on.archived recordingWe should note CNN has not independently confirmed BuzzFeed’s reporting, nor for that matter has anyone else.michael schmidtAnd we got a fair amount of pushback and struggled to get it confirmed.archived recordingMSNBC, NBC News couldn’t confirm that information. If I’m — This information is not verified at The Washington Post. We can’t verify this information independently. — not independently confirm these allegations. No other news organization, other than BuzzFeed, has this story at this point.michael schmidtAnd by that evening, we saw something highly unusual.archived recordingHere is the breaking news, a rare and stunning move from the special counsel tonight. Robert Mueller’s team disputing an explosive BuzzFeed report alleging the president told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.michael schmidtThe special counsel’s office, which rarely speaks publicly, put out a statement knocking down the story.archived recordingQuote, “BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate.”michael barbaroRight — saying very forcefully and very clearly something in this story is wrong.michael schmidtThis was a reporter’s worst nightmare.archived recordingThis isn’t a correction of the BuzzFeed story. This is an annihilation of it. And this is a bad one for BuzzFeed, man. They maybe should have stuck to some cat listicles. It’s not good. The press is making itself look very, very badly. And it’s going to be very difficult for this media to restore any credibility it once had before. And I think —michael schmidtHere you have the special counsel, Bob Mueller, who probably has more credibility in Washington right now than anyone else, saying your story’s not true.archived recordingSo the people are saying heads should roll at BuzzFeed, that you’re hurting the news business as a whole. What do you say?archived recording (anthony cormier)I’ve been a reporter for 20 years. This is going to be borne out, Brian. This story is accurate.michael schmidtIt got me thinking of a time when a similar team of journalists found themselves in a very similar situation. You rolling? So I got in an Uber and went to Georgetown — [RINGING]speakerHello?michael schmidtHi, this is Mike Schmidt. Is Bob there?speakerJust a second.bob woodwardGood to see you. How are you, pal?michael schmidtTo the home of Bob Woodward.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the perils of reporting on a presidential investigation. It’s Thursday, January 31.michael schmidt1, 2, 1, 2. How’s that? [DOG BARKING]bob woodwardWe’ll see if we can quiet the dog and the door and the phone.michael schmidtOh, it’s fine.bob woodwardI’m sorry. It’s the real world.michael schmidtIt’s the real Bob Woodward.bob woodwardWell, the life of living with a dog.michael schmidtIt’s fine.michael barbaroSo what’s the story that Woodward told you?michael schmidtThe story Woodward told me starts with the Watergate break-in in June of 1972.archived recordingDemocratic National Committee is trying to solve a spy mystery. It began before dawn Saturday when five intruders were captured by police inside the offices of the committee in Washington.bob woodwardIt was at 2:30 in the morning. And by 9 o’clock, the editors at The Post were getting on — how are we going to cover this?archived recordingFive people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the middle of the night.michael schmidtBob Woodward and his partner Carl Bernstein jumped on that story.bob woodwardI was sent to the courthouse and saw burglars in business suits. Didn’t make sense. Lead burglar worked for the CIA. So there was an immediate curiosity.michael schmidtIn the weeks and months after the break-in, Woodward and Carl Bernstein are out front on this coverage.archived recordingOne of the suspects, James McCord, operates his own security company in Washington. He was doing work for the Republican National Committee and the committee to re-elect President Nixon. No one has proved that the Republicans are behind the break-in, but tomorrow the Democrats are expected to file some sort of legal action against the G.O.P. anyway. Mr. Nixon, did you know about the burglary of our Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate?michael schmidtThey are doing everything possible to figure out ties between the burglars who broke into the Watergate and Nixon’s campaign.bob woodwardConventional wisdom then was, Nixon’s too smart to do this. But Carl and I didn’t do conventional wisdom, to be honest with you.michael barbaroAnd they kind of have the story all to themselves.michael schmidtThey are out front, even when some news organizations are ignoring it.michael barbaroIncluding The Times.michael schmidtThe Post was ahead, big time.bob woodwardWe started developing sources like the bookkeeper who kept their records on the money and the treasurer, Hugh Sloan. And so it was always about money, or at least that was one path of exploration.michael schmidtAnd they discover this slush fund, this pot of money that Nixon’s advisers controlled so they could dole money out to folks like the burglars to do the dirty political deeds that they thought needed to happen as Nixon was running for re-election.bob woodwardSo we found out that John Mitchell, who’d been the attorney general, who’d been Nixon’s campaign manager, controlled dispersal of the funds. So did Maurice Stans, who was the —michael schmidtAs part of that coverage, Woodward and Bernstein were able to establish four people who had access to those funds, people very close to the president, including his campaign manager at the time.michael barbaroSo this reporting is starting to get closer and closer to President Nixon himself?michael schmidtCorrect. And that October, Woodward and Bernstein thought they had a huge scoop.bob woodwardAll roads led to Haldeman, the White House chief of staff —michael schmidtThat’s H. R. Haldeman.bob woodwardH. R. — Bob — Haldeman.michael schmidtThey had learned that H. R. Haldeman, the person closest to the president, controlled the slush fund.bob woodwardSo we interviewed people, including Hugh Sloan, and he finally said it was Haldeman.michael schmidtAnd Hugh Sloan, the treasurer of Nixon’s campaign, had testified about that to the grand jury investigating the president.michael barbaroA big scoop.michael schmidtCorrect.bob woodwardThis was the big story. If he was involved in this, if he could authorize money, that led right to Nixon’s doorstep.michael schmidtBecause this would be the first person inside the White House at the time who was also controlling the funds from the slush fund.bob woodwardPrecisely.michael schmidtSo they were reporting on this just weeks before the November election. They have three sources confirming Haldeman’s the guy. And on deadline, right before they’re about to publish, their editor asked them to get another source.bob woodwardSo Bernstein called a lawyer in the Justice Department and said, you know, we know it’s Haldeman. And the lawyer said, I’d like to help you, I really would, but I just can’t say anything.michael schmidtSo Bernstein comes up with a workaround. And he says to the official —bob woodwardHe said, I’ll count to 10, and if it’s O.K., tell me it’s O.K.michael schmidtI’m going to count to 10. And if by the time I’m done counting you haven’t said anything, I’ll know the story’s true.michael barbaroHmm.bob woodwardAnd this was done in a very clever but direct way.michael schmidtSo Bernstein starts counting. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.bob woodwardAnd the lawyer said, you’ve got it straight now.michael schmidtYou’ve got it straight now.bob woodwardBernstein thanked him again and hung up. He told me about it. We have a fourth source.michael schmidtThey tell the editors, and they publish.michael barbaroSo then what happens?michael schmidtAs they expected, the story lands with huge impact.bob woodwardThe story came out, lead story. And we feel quite comfortable.michael schmidtEveryone in Washington is buzzing about it. It shows just how high the conspiracy went into the White House. And Woodward and Bernstein are in the newsroom that day, basking in the glory of the story, when —bob woodwardA reporter at The Post, education reporter Eric Wentworth, said, have you seen what happened on television? And we hadn’t seen anything.michael schmidtDid you guys just see what Hugh Sloan’s lawyer said on television?michael barbaroAnd what had Sloan’s lawyer said?archived recordingI assume you’re referring to the testimony before the grand jury, as reported in The Washington Post this morning?michael schmidtSloan’s lawyer, with Sloan standing right next to him —archived recordingOur answer to that is an unequivocal no. Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all.michael schmidtHad come out and knocked the story down.bob woodwardAnd Sloan’s our source and somebody we’d developed a close relationship with, as you know, with sources. And it is agony.michael schmidtHere you had his lawyer standing there on national television saying the story’s not true.bob woodwardI can’t describe the emotions, but they included — we’re finished, we’re going to have to resign.michael schmidtIt’s the worst feeling as a journalist, right?bob woodwardYeah. You have a sinking feeling that — it’s so intense you don’t even know where your stomach is. You know it’s somewhere in your body, and it’s crying out really hard.michael barbaroSo what had actually happened? Had they gotten anything wrong?michael schmidtThey didn’t know.bob woodwardWe were saying, well, we need to write some sort of story. We need to back down. Or we need to explain. And then Bradlee said, look, you’re not even sure whether you got it right or wrong. What part is wrong? You don’t know where you are. You haven’t got the facts. Hold your water for a while.michael schmidtSo Woodward called Sloan’s lawyer.bob woodwardHe said, look, you don’t have to apologize for this. And essentially, it’s true.michael schmidtThe general thrust of the story is right.bob woodwardBut you’re wrong on the grand jury testimony. You connected the dots that were not connectable.michael schmidtYou guys were just off when you said that Sloan testified about this to the grand jury.bob woodwardAnd then I finally got to Deep Throat, Mark Felt.michael schmidtSo then Woodward went to Deep Throat.bob woodwardI mean, this was 3:00 a.m., I think the next day or two days later. The days rushed together.michael schmidtAnd Deep Throat told him —bob woodwardWhen you move on somebody like Haldeman, you’ve got to be sure you’re on the most solid ground. What a royal screw-up, he said. And then he said, look —michael schmidtThe story was right.bob woodwardThe whole thing — Watergate, all the espionage — is a Haldeman operation. He’s behind it.michael schmidtBut you guys, by getting that one fact wrong about the grand jury, have done the improbable.bob woodwardYou’ve got people feeling sorry for Haldeman. I didn’t think that was possible.michael schmidtYou’ve made people feel bad for Haldeman, one of the most disliked people in Washington.michael barbaroAnd one of the ringleaders of these dirty tricks, with access to the slush fund, a main character in this illegal plot.michael schmidtThe person closest to Nixon.michael barbaroMike, I’m curious what Woodward told you was the fatal error in this reporting that led to this error of the grand jury reference? Because four sources is a lot of sources.michael schmidtThere were three things. One was that they were proceeding with confirmation bias.bob woodwardCarl and I had heard what we wanted to hear.michael schmidtThey thought the information was true. They were simply looking for sources to give them the O.K. to move forward with that.michael barbaroMhmm.michael schmidtThe second thing is that —bob woodwardWe didn’t go through that process of sitting with Sloan and saying, O.K., did they ask you at the grand jury about Haldeman’s role?michael schmidtThey never went back to Sloan himself and walked him through exactly what they were going to be saying about his testimony. That really would have given them a chance to flush things out.michael barbaroRight, because he might have noticed them referring to a grand jury. And he would have said, no, what you are saying is right, but I never said it to a grand jury.michael schmidtCorrect. It would have been a good way to catch it. And the third thing —bob woodwardThe whole Bernstein, you know, silent confirm or hang up method —michael schmidtIs that when Bernstein, on deadline, called the Justice Department official and used this confusing way of asking him about it, that failed too.bob woodwardEveryone was just shaking their head, and that only made everyone more ill.michael schmidtAnd they missed a final opportunity to catch the mistake.michael barbaroBut as Woodward went back to all these sources and learned that the heart of the story was true, was he able to report that?michael schmidtSo what they did a day or so after the story was write a piece.bob woodwardLet’s level as much as we can. And we were able in this case to level.michael schmidtAnd they said —bob woodwardWe were wrong on the grand jury, but it was a Haldeman operation.michael schmidtThat while they had gotten the grand jury part wrong, Haldeman had indeed controlled the slush fund. And the general thrust of what they had reported was right.bob woodwardI’m not sure it had any traction, because it looked like, in the beginning of 1973, Watergate might just recede, go away.michael schmidtSo the story came at a critical time in the narrative because there were questions about whether this was really a story.bob woodwardYes, and whether we had it right.michael schmidtThe initial splash of the wrong story overshadows the important news that is right.michael barbaroHmm.michael schmidtThe thing about big stories that are big deals is that if there is a part of it that is wrong, it allows the person who doesn’t like the story to drive a Mack truck right through it.michael barbaroRight.michael schmidtSo while they were right in terms of the narrative and arc of what was going on and what had happened and how high this went into the White House, the mistake gave the White House the excuse to jump on that and say, see, look, this story’s wrong, and all their other reporting about this is just like it. It’s been wrong.archived recordingI don’t respect the type of journalism, the shabby journalism that is being practiced by The Washington Post. And I used the term shoddy journalism, shabby journalism. And I’ve used the term character assassination.michael schmidtWhat you are saying is wrong. You have no credibility because of that.archived recordingMr. Vice President, Mrs. Agnew, all of our very distinguished guests here at the —michael schmidtNixon was overwhelmingly re-elected that November.archived recording (president nixon)I’ve never known a national election when I would be able to go to bed earlier than tonight.michael schmidtAnd the roots of fake news in the American discourse begin to grow.bob woodwardThat’s happened to you.michael schmidtCorrect.bob woodwardHappened to every reporter. And this is where I think the whole discussion has been confused. My observation of reporting — we all make mistakes, but the effort is good faith. We are trying to find out what really happened in here. There’s never a moment Carl and myself — saying, well, you know, let’s stretch. Let’s take it too far. We thought we had it. It was a good-faith, stupid, dumbass mistake, but we made it. Now, how much people are willing to accept good faith — there was no intent, there was no deception — I don’t know. And that’s why we have to in this era now, what, 45 years later, 46 years later, try to not make any mistake.michael schmidtSo you’re saying all these decades later, this story is still in the back of your mind as you report.bob woodwardIndeed it is. I’ve been sitting here with you — thank you for reliving this chapter of my life. You can’t have that experience and it not be embedded in your head of, how could I have been so stupid and careless? And we laid it out as best we could, but it’s not a very pretty picture about being careful.michael schmidtGreat. I think we got everything, right?bob woodwardO.K. Good. O.K.michael schmidtThat was great.archived recordingLet’s take a look at what BuzzFeed did to request comment from the special counsel. This first email is from Jason Leopold, the co-author of the story, sent to the special counsel’s office. It says here, “Peter, hope all is well. Anthony and I have a story coming up stating that Cohen was directed by Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations relating to the Trump Moscow project. Assume no comment from you, but just wanted to check. Best, Jason.” Ben, to me, this is a shockingly casual way to ask for comment for such a serious story. Do you think that was an appropriate and sufficient way to ask for comment?archived recording (ben smith)You know, Peter, the spokesman for the special counsel, has told The Washington Post, I believe yesterday, or people close to him on background, that if we had asked differently, he would have given us more information.archived recordingBut come on, one paragraph? That’s a dereliction of duty to send a three-sentence email —archived recording (ben smith)I will say — [MUSIC] And that was the choice he made, right?archived recordingBut when I send e-mails to BuzzFeed spokespeople, and I’m about to write about you, it’s a bullet-point, long email, everything that’s going to be included. I want to make sure everything has been checked first. Why didn’t Jason do that? Carr has now said that he would have responded in more detail if he had more detail. He could have said that two minutes later, right? He could have said — [MUSIC] O.K., process question number two, then.archived recording (ben smith)Yeah.archived recordingWhy publish Thursday night as opposed to waiting for a third source or a fourth source, knowing the stakes of this story?archived recording (ben smith)We published because we were very, very confident in the sourcing of this story in the way that you would — and, you know, we had been waiting, right? It was not like Anthony walked into my office on Thursday at noon and said, I have this. This is a story we’ve been developing over a long period of time, that we’ve been working on with sources.michael barbaroMike, why did this story that Woodward told you remind you of the BuzzFeed story?michael schmidtBecause in both cases, they were really reporting two things — one was the existence of the information. In the BuzzFeed story, it’s the fact that Cohen said Trump asked him to lie to Congress. The second thing they were reporting is that investigators knew about it. It was the same situation that Woodward found himself in because they had reported that Sloan knew about the slush fund and that Haldeman and controlled it, and he had told it to the grand jury. The fact that the investigators knew about it gave the fact validity. It said, this is not just something that’s floating out there that we figured out on our own. This is something that the people investigating the president have figured out. If you don’t have the validity, the backing of investigators knowing it, the reporting at times feels shakier.michael barbaroRight, which is why the moment BuzzFeed reported that Mueller knew Trump had done this is when Democrats in the House and the Senate were saying, we have to act, this is the moment to impeach the president.michael schmidtYes. But it was the second part that they didn’t have locked down, that undercut them in their reporting in the story, that allowed the White House to attack them. So when the public finds out that the second part is not true, that the investigators do not know this, it negates the primary fact that they were reporting on.michael barbaroRight, and that’s why when the second part is challenged, the first part is so fundamentally undermined. The first part no longer feels like it can be true if the second part also isn’t true. They’re highly linked.michael schmidtRight, but what will ultimately matter is whether the fact they were bringing forward, that Trump asked Cohen to lie to Congress, is true. That will be the most important thing. When Woodward is in the middle of it and he made this mistake, he thought he was going to have to resign. The public turned on him. The White House went after him. Now, looking back on that, that seems ridiculous to imagine, because most of us don’t even remember that mistake. His reporting on Watergate is remembered as heroic and historic, but that’s because of how the investigation ended. We’re sort of back in that situation now with the BuzzFeed story. Will it be proven out that Trump asked Cohen to lie and that be a central part of the Trump story? If so, the BuzzFeed reporters will be looked at as being at the front of this and really have uncovered important information.michael barbaroRight. And their error seeming very small.michael schmidtRight. But if history doesn’t go in that direction, it will be a story that critics and defenders of Trump will point to in the years to come as examples of the media going too far as it tried to cover the investigation.michael barbaroSo what you’re saying is right now, it’s too early to know if the BuzzFeed reporting is what Woodward’s mistake ultimately turned out to be — a small factual error along the way when the big picture of the reporting is accurate, or a sign that what the media thinks might be true, what the president would argue the media perhaps wants to be true, is not, in fact, what the investigators have found.michael schmidtAnd the problem is that the public wants an answer now. And usually that takes a lot of time. As Woodward often says, it takes a long time for history to be sussed out.michael barbaroMike, thank you very much.michael schmidtThanks for having me.michael barbaroHere’s what else you need to know. One day after his own intelligence chiefs contradicted him on the threats posed by Iran, North Korea, and ISIS, President Trump lashed out at them in a series of tweets questioning their intellect. The president wrote that the officials, including the heads of the CIA and the FBI, are quote, “naive and passive,” especially about the dangers of Iran and North Korea and suggested that, quote, “perhaps intelligence should go back to school.” And on Wednesday, local police said that the deep freeze that has settled over the Midwest has killed at least eight people, including some who froze to death after exposure to the cold from Milwaukee to Detroit. The record low temperatures in cities like Minneapolis and Chicago reached minus 28 degrees with a wind chill of minus 53, resulting in widespread flight cancellations, school closures, and even the suspension of mail delivery throughout the region.speaker 3Woo.

Want this by email? Sign up here.A bleak message reverberates in DavosAn influential financier warned investors in a letter to pay heed to growing risks and social tensions — and the message is already resonating at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Andrew writes in his column.In his annual letter, Seth A. Klarman, the billionaire investor who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, warns that social and political division risks economic calamity:“It can’t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions.”His message is likely to encourage hand-wringing of a sort usually seen in Davos, Andrew writes.Mr. Klarman says mounting debt in developed countries since the 2008 financial crisis could lead to a financial panic. He is especially worried about the debt load in the United States:“There is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.”More from Davos: Political turmoil has led several world leaders to skip the gathering. And less than a quarter of people attending are women.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________China’s economy expands at its slowest paceThe world’s second largest economy grew 6.6 percent last year, the Chinese government said on Monday — its most sedate pace in nearly three decades. The slowdown intensified in the last three months of 2018, and the official jobless rate increased to 4.9 percent last month from 4.8 percent in November.Economists tend to be skeptical about official data from Beijing, but there’s been an onslaught of evidence recently for weakness in the Chinese economy, brought on by crushing debt, a bitter trade fight with the U.S. and evolving business norms.Factory jobs are no longer desirable, leading manufacturers to try automation, according to the NYT. Ford Motor assembly plants in Chongqing are slowing production. Chinese exporters have delayed hiring plans.And China’s securities industry last year suffered its first annual decline in head count since 2014. Bonuses are likely to shrink, too.Officials around the world are sounding the alarm:• Cecilia Malmström, the European Union’s commissioner for trade, said that European investment in China was declining, because doing business there was “becoming increasingly complicated.”• Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister of Singapore, a nation heavily reliant on international trade, said at the World Economic Forum that trade friction between China and the U.S. could have a “very negative” effect on the global economy.• President Xi Jinping of China said on Monday that his Communist Party faced “sharp and serious dangers”:The party is facing long-term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long-term rule, reform and opening-up, a market-driven economy, and within the external environment.ImageChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F.CreditFabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesI.M.F. expects a ‘serious slowdown’The International Monetary Fund brought a chill to this week’s down-jacketed procession of world leaders, cutting its global economic growth forecasts.The fund expects weakness in Europe, a slowdown in China, a possible no-deal Brexit and trade spats sustained by the U.S. to lead to 3.5 percent growth in 2019 and 3.6 percent growth in 2020, down from October’s forecasts.“Risks are rising” after two years of “solid expansion,” said Christine Lagarde, its managing director. She added:“Does that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.”More on the global outlook:• The I.M.F. got a new chief economist this month: Gita Gopinath of Harvard, the first woman in the role. She issued warnings at Davos about China and Brexit.• Central banks are grappling with how to use verbal cues and other hints to signal their plans as conditions get tougher.• Some 30 percent of business leaders expect global expansion to slow — six times the number who felt that way a year ago, according to a survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers. It found 37 percent of North American executives optimistic, down from 63 percent last year.• But in what Matt Phillips called “a remarkable turnaround,” stocks have surged in the first few weeks of the year after a substantial plunge at the end of 2018. Buoyed by assurances from the Federal Reserve, it is the market’s best start to a year since 1987.Shutdown Day 32: Rejected proposals and old habitsAs a flash freeze arrived in the Midwest and the Northeast, the shutdown continued to weigh on the homeless, the elderly, veterans, low-income renters and many others.Democrats, who have refused to negotiate until the government is reopened, rejected a proposal from President Trump on Saturday to exchange temporary protections for some immigrants for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, called it “hostage taking.”In response, Mr. Trump complained that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has behaved “irrationally,” and then took a shot at San Francisco, which she represents. The bulk of Republican senators have fallen in line behind his proposal, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is said to be incorporating the terms into a broader package.Mr. Trump’s behavior feels familiar, write Russ Beuttner and Maggie Haberman:As he did during decades in business, Mr. Trump has insulted adversaries, undermined his aides, repeatedly changed course, extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos.More shutdown news:• Companies unable to finalize approval for initial public offerings are trying to move ahead with workarounds.• Hours before the shutdown began, Mr. Trump signed a bipartisan criminal justice bill. Implementation is likely to be delayed.• The stock market is one of Mr. Trump’s favorite indicators of his administration’s success. But at times, the going’s been bumpy.Brinkmanship over BrexitAfter her Brexit plan was defeated, Prime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament yesterday with a Plan B. It looked a lot like Plan A, writes Stephen Castle, setting the stage for another battle with rebellious lawmakers.The proposal: Mrs. May promised to negotiate changes that many regard as cosmetic.The strategy: She appeared to double down on her gamble that lawmakers will eventually hold their noses and vote for her plan, rather than risk a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.The response: Frustration. The process is more or less where it has been for months, with Mrs. May locked in a game of brinkmanship as the clock ticks down.More Brexit news: Britain’s main opposition party is backing a proposal that could open the door to a second referendum. The European Union is increasing its efforts to avoid market chaos if there’s no deal. Companies buying British assets are having to find financing in euros or dollars, if they can find it at all. Two trading platforms are moving out of London. There’s been violence in Northern Ireland. Britain’s statistics agency could find no evidence for a claim that Brexit is making food companies shrink their products. And the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund spent nearly $123 million on a property near Buckingham Palace.Revolving DoorThe chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, Philip Hampton, will step down as the drugmaker breaks itself up.

Government falls. By Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Jan. 30, 2019ImageLauren Underwood, Democrat of Illinois, campaigning in North Aurora, Ill. The district she won in November was one in which residents had incomes that were higher than the statewide median.
CreditCreditJoshua Lott for The New York TimesOne clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that President Trump and his fellow Republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground.Take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, states that provided the Electoral College votes crucial to Trump’s capture of the White House.John C. Austin, the director of the Michigan Economic Center and a senior fellow at Brookings, analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year — 12 from Republican to Democrat, three from Democrat to Republican — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa.Austin found a striking pattern. In the majority of districts that went from Republican to Democrat:Residents had incomes higher than statewide medians, as well as higher educational attainment — in most places by considerable margins. Conversely, in the three districts that moved from blue to red, incomes and educational attainment lagged statewide figures.The accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts.Where Voters Are Trending BlueIndustrial-state House districts that changed from Republican to Democratic representation in 2018 tended to be economically better off than their states overall. Figures are the difference between median district income and statewide median income among districts that changed parties.

By The New York Times | Source: analysis of 2017 American Community Survey data by John Austin for BrookingsThe same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms.In September 2018, Siobhan Hughes and Dante Chinni of The Wall Street Journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the Cook Political Report. They then ranked the races on the basis of an “economic-health index created by the Institute of International Finance.”Of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health, eight were categorized “lean Republican” by the Cook Political Report, and two “lean Democrat.” Before the November election, nine of those 10 seats were held by Republicans.On Election Day, Democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts.Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, both of Brookings, worked with John Harwood of CNBC to analyze Democratic and Republican-held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election. Their conclusions reinforce the findings of Austin, Hughes and Chinni.The key result: the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by Democrats, while Republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous, measured by share of G.D.P. The accompanying chart illustrates their analysis.Rich District, Poor DistrictThe most economically productive U.S. House districts are led by Democrats. Most of the poorest 20 districts voted Republican.

By The New York Times | Source: Brookings analysis of data from Emsi, the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe authors’ calculation of the contribution to the G.D.P. of every congressional district showed that Democratic districts produce $10.2 trillion of the nation’s goods and services and Republican districts $6.2 trillion.This trend creates a significant dilemma for Trump and the Republican Party. Candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections, they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn. Electorally speaking, in other words, Republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline.Let’s return to John Austin of the Michigan Economic Center. In an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly: “A rising economic tide tends to sink the Trump tugboat,” adding“Certainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned, not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and ‘blaming others’ for people’s woes (like immigrants and people of color) that fuel Trump’s supporters.”In June 2017, Austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the Republican Party. His study of the 2016 presidential results in the Midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help Republicans. In that earlier report, Austin wrote:The small- and medium-sized factory towns that dot the highways and byways of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin have lost their anchor employers and are struggling to fill the void. Many of these communities, including once solidly Democratic-voting, union-heavy, blue collar strongholds, flipped to Trump in 2016.This pattern is not limited to the United States. There are numerous studies demonstrating that European and British voters who are falling behind in the global economy, and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state, drove Brexit as well as the rise of right-wing populist parties.One paper, “Measuring the Effects of Economic Austerity on Pro-Sociality: Evidence from Greece,” by Nicholas Sambanis, Anna Schultz and Elena Nikolova, political scientists at Penn, Duke and University College London, found, for example,A strong relationship between job loss and decreased generalized solidarity. We find evidence of in-group bias and the bias becomes more pronounced due to exposure to austerity policies.In a July 2018 paper, “Did Austerity Cause Brexit?” Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right-wing populist party UKIP in Britain and to voter approval of Brexit.These political movements “are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010,” Fetzer writes. Examination of economic trends, welfare policy and polling data shows, according to Fetzer, thatthe EU referendum (Brexit) could have resulted in a Remain victory had it not been for a range of austerity-induced welfare reforms. These reforms activated existing economic grievances. Further, auxiliary results suggest that the underlying economic grievances have broader origins than what the current literature on Brexit suggests. Up until 2010, the UK’s welfare state evened out growing income differences across the skill divide through transfer payments. This pattern markedly stops from 2010 onward as austerity started to bite.There are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against Brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country.In a separate 2017 paper, “Who Voted For Brexit,” Fetzer and two fellow economists at the University of Warwick, Sascha O. Becker and Dennis Novy, found that “in particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent U.K. austerity program are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share.” This heldall across the board: more deprivation is tightly associated with a larger Vote Leave share or, vice versa; less deprivation is tightly associated with a lower Vote Leave share.The results here and in England reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get, the better the right does.As a rule, as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure, they become more generous and more liberal. In the United States, this means that voters move to the left; in Britain, it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the European Union.In his forthcoming book, “Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics” Carles Boix, a political scientist at Princeton, describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid-1970s led to a liberal international consensus:In light of the historical experience of advanced countries, embracing the program of embedded liberalism made economic and political sense. Twentieth-century democratic capitalism had proved to be both successful and resilient: it had delivered high growth; it had allowed governments to fund generous social programs; and it had sent its main political and economic competitor — communism — to the ash heap of history.As global competition, outsourcing and later, automation, began to produce significant economic disruption, beginning in the 1970s, this liberal consensus frayed.Boix writes,The structure of electoral participation became strongly polarized across the Atlantic — very much in line with the economic transformations brought about by the decline of industry and by globalization in the last forty years.In the United States, economic adversity helped produce Trump, whose inaugural speech (reportedly the handiwork of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller) Boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism:For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left. And the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now.Together, the trends described above raise an intriguing question: If the Republican Party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind, does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline?I asked scholars and officials at the Niskanen Center — a Washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division — whether they thought the Republican Party has come to recognize that prosperity helps Democrats, while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants, resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban America. Does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline?Jerry Taylor, president of Niskanen, replied to my inquiry by making the case that “as conservatives see it, the more visible government dysfunction is, the better. It provides civic education.”Working from this premise, Taylor argued that as far as conservatives go,anything that dispels the illusion that government can be harnessed for positive ends is generally a good thing, and anything that reduces its power and scope is a salutary development.Taylor disputed the suggestion that “Republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white America.” Instead, he said, they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth isonly reliably ensured when government is minimized, taxes are nearly inconsequential, and free markets and property rights are given the greatest scope possible. Marry that with their belief that a rising economic tide will lift all boats, and you can quickly see why they’re at a loss to explain what’s going on in rural America.Will Wilkinson, the center’s vice president for research, wrote back to me:The G.O.P.’s success in struggling places has given them a false impression that voters who live there will stay faithful as long as they keep feeding them culture-war chum. Trump’s populism offered a false but compelling diagnosis of their economic problems, immigrants and insufficiently protectionist trade policy, which dovetails neatly with rural white anxieties about declining cultural status and relative political power. If you can align threats to identity with threats to material security, as Trump did, it’s pretty powerful.But, in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing, Wilkinson continued, Trump’strade war is positively hurting agriculture and manufacturing, and every Republican member of congress has voted multiple times to strip away health benefits — leaving ‘identity threat’ as the party’s last resort.What’s more, Wilkinson noted,Identity threat — ‘I don’t recognize this country anymore’ — is very abstract compared to material threat — ‘my daughter with leukemia will die if they don’t cover pre-existing conditions’ — and far less motivating. And the argument that the G.O.P. establishment itself has become a threat to economic/material welfare has started to become persuasive.This has put the Republican Party in a painful position, according to Wilkinson:It’s going to get worse for the G.O.P. as the urgency of the economic problems grows. But they just don’t understand that pushing the same button over and over isn’t going to have the same effect. And this is so in part because they don’t really want to see the seriousness of economic divergence, because they have no idea what to do about it that is remotely consistent with Zombie Reagan social policy dogma.Brink Lindsey, vice president for policy, replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle: “You don’t need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain Republican governance failures.”In Lindsey’s view,it starts in ideological self-delusion — that government is simply incapable of performing well, so starving it of funds is always a good idea and trying to make it work better is a waste of time. The problem starts there, as I said, but it doesn’t end there, as these attitudes can very easily merge into cynical, lazy indifference to public administration and onward to outright venality and corruption. And, of course, this ideological stance turns out to be incredibly convenient for rich donors looking for any excuse to keep their taxes down.This is not, according to Lindsey,a conspiracy, but rather a rotten equilibrium. Lack of trust in government brings charlatans to power, further reducing trust in government and widening the path to power for future charlatans.In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the Republican Party’s “rotten equilibrium.”The first, of course, is Trump himself. His victory in 2016 was a charlatan’s ascent, and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government — fuel, in one sense, for the continued success of charlatans. For the moment, though, his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force.Trump’s second, if less heralded, achievement has been to invigorate the Democratic opposition. He has inspired an immense, rambunctious, intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates — some prepared, some less so, to dislodge him from the White House.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Thomas B.
